Peter Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know. Hope all is well. Elizabeth  713 853 6349 
Attached is a brief memo I prepared in anticipation of the meeting scheduled for Wed., May 23rd, to discuss setoff issues.  Please call if you have any questions or comments. Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 
Attached is a preliminary draft of the letter prepared by Gibbs & Bruns notifying TVA of the occurrence of a Triggering Event and EMPI's suspension of deliveries under the MOPA.  Please review and call me with any questions or comments.  We will need to carefully consider EPMI's offer to provide energy under the MOPA at market based rates.  As you are aware,  the current plan is to send TVA  notice on Jan. 4th. The draft of the control area  petition should be ready for circulation on Tuesday, the 28th.   Once received, I will forward both the petition and a revised draft of this letter to legal, regulatory and trading for review. CONFIDENTIAL/ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVLEDGE 
Mark Attached is the draft memo. After you have had a chance to review, please call me with your thoughts/comments.  I would also like to briefly speak with John Klauberg about ""East Coast"" municipalities to make sure he thinks this policy works in the east as well.  John is going to call me early this afternoon.  Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).  Finally, it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should distribute the memo. Thanks Elizabeth

Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable Top Legal Risks 1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak. Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination damages, broad performance outs. 2.

Attached is a draft letter setting forth Enron's damages in connection with the termination of certain commodity forward and swap positions with PG&E. In lieu of sending out multiple letters and then aggregating the exposures for set off purposes, I thought it would be more understandable if we put all the matters in one letter.  For each product line,  I thought we could attach all the relevant information (I'm not sure if this is making it too easy for the court but it seems like the right thing to do). Each commodity line then would assemble the following and attach as an Appendix to the letter: 1.  Copy of Master Contract or applicable GTC 2.  Copy of transaction confirmations 3.  Copy of termination notice sent to PG&E 4.  Chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction(s) 5.  Chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same 6.  Chart setting forth termination payment calculation for each terminated trade 7.  Paragraph describing methodology used to determine termination payment valuation (eg - 4 quotes secured, threw out high and low and averaged middle) 8   List showing quotes secured (entity, person, time and amount) and the extent available, written confirmation of such quote I will be out of the office the rest of this week but will organize a call for early next week in order to finalize the PG&E package. Thanks for all your help. Elizabeth Sager

Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms. Thanks Elizabeth Sager 
make sure Portz is in MNA group thanks

** PRIVATE ** Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night.  Overall, I felt we made a lot of progress.  At the end of the call, Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points.  We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then ""compare notes.""  He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly. Material Regulatory Change Provision.  Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability to pay for power.  (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change).  Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a ""default"" (which should not be a problem from our standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.  (For example, a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC).  Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.  However, he did say that CDWR might entertain a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it.  My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs. Early Walk Provision.  He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option. With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) (our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date. Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 days.  He said all other suppliers have lived with that.  Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the ""bond guys"" are already nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs). Suspension of Delivery.  Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other events, such as a bond downgrade.  Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that. Downgrade not a Default.  CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default.  However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.  In other words, a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.  Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued.  That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without LDs. Cross Defaults.  This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not be able to get this is my sense.  However, when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR. LD Calculation Methodology.  Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language.  He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more ""objective.""  My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general. Arbitration.  In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).  Also, holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral.  I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise.  My general sense, however, is that this is not a ""deal breaker"" for CDWR. Assignment.  In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking  for some consistency.  We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our reaction would be.  Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we said we would look at.  We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment.  He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals. New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.  A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad. Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.  He di agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it was fair for us to be protected from that. Legal Opinions.  Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds.  Also, he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins. Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires. Additional CDWR Covenants.  Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed internally with CDWR. Pro Rata ""Spread"" Amortization.  Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would run it by CDWR. CDWR Information.  Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information.  He was resisting our request for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things start to fall into place. Let me know when you wish to follow up. John ""This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

Elisabeth: I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

to Morgan Stanley 
FYI I was also helping on this deal as was Jason. Thanks 
** PRIVATE ** Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night.  Overall, I felt we made a lot of progress.  At the end of the call, Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points.  We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then ""compare notes.""  He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly. Material Regulatory Change Provision.  Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability to pay for power.  (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change).  Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a ""default"" (which should not be a problem from our standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.  (For example, a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC).  Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.  However, he did say that CDWR might entertain a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it.  My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs. Early Walk Provision.  He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option. With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) (our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date. Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 days.  He said all other suppliers have lived with that.  Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the ""bond guys"" are already nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs). Suspension of Delivery.  Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other events, such as a bond downgrade.  Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that. Downgrade not a Default.  CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default.  However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.  In other words, a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.  Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued.  That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without LDs. Cross Defaults.  This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not be able to get this is my sense.  However, when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR. LD Calculation Methodology.  Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language.  He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more ""objective.""  My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general. Arbitration.  In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).  Also, holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral.  I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise.  My general sense, however, is that this is not a ""deal breaker"" for CDWR. Assignment.  In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking  for some consistency.  We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our reaction would be.  Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we said we would look at.  We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment.  He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals. New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.  A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad. Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.  He di agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it was fair for us to be protected from that. Legal Opinions.  Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds.  Also, he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins. Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires. Additional CDWR Covenants.  Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed internally with CDWR. Pro Rata ""Spread"" Amortization.  Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would run it by CDWR. CDWR Information.  Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information.  He was resisting our request for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things start to fall into place. Let me know when you wish to follow up. John ""This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

can you help Martin w this thanks 
Elisabeth: I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of the MOPA. The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings. 
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or is contemplating taking relating to TVA: Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA) Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of notice) Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface issues If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me immediately. Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody, Elizabeth Sager

This proposal is conditioned on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings. 
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or is contemplating taking relating to TVA: Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA) Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of notice) Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface issues If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me immediately. Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody, Elizabeth Sager 
At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of the MOPA. The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.

Rough first draft.  I'll come down soon. Thanks Elizabeth Sager 
Attached are clean and marked copies of the online trading GTCs for physical power which I have generally discussed with Bryan Murtagh (UBS). You will note that we have elected to use the EEI form by incorporation as we believe this will be the most marketable approach understanding that different forms will be required for many players, eg WSPP. I will be doing a final review over the weekend and expect this form to be final by Monday am.  If you have any questions/comments, please let me know. By copy of this email to Genia, I would ask for her help in cleaning up the document (sorry, beyond my current skills, hopefully, soon to be broadened) and would ask Leslie to carefully review and provide me any thoughts/comments.  Based upon this document, we will have ready by Monday pm, the long form EEI for regular negotiation. thanks Elizabeth Sager 713-853-6349 w 713 864-4023 h

Elizabeth asked me to let you all know that MS has proposed to have a conf. call on the 14th to discuss their draft Collateral Support Annex. We plan to participate. Please email me any comments you may have -  in advance of the 14th of course! Thank you, Shari 
At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input. 
To All: Bill McCoy has completed an initial draft of a credit annex for consideration by the drafting committee and interested working group participants.  If you provide your comments to me, I'll circulate them.  Bill is willing to have a conference call to discuss when everyone is ready. Andrew S.

Mark and Jeff Here is information I rec'd regarding the upcoming EEI meeting on Friday May 7th. Elizabeth 36349 
Hi Karen Going to the legal conference.  Lucky me. I get to go only for Wed. night and 2 hours on Thurs. then get to fly to DC for meetings w MH and others regarding contract standardization. Your analysis is historically correct but recently we have changed our policy. The new policy is meeting w limited sucess. Let me know if you need any thing else. 
I  believe this contract has been executed - Kenton was the lawyer working w Paul P.  Let me know if you need us to track it down. Give me a call anytime to discuss the industry in genreal eas 
Sheila I may have mispoke - I thought you were talking about the power contracts.  I don't think the current gas form permits assignements in connection w 
Jim Friday morning would be great for the Gibbs & Brun lawyers to meet with Tabors.  They have been speaking to him about a meeting in DC next week but if we could do it here it would be fantastic.  Let me know if you can get Tabors to stay over. Thanks Elizabeth 
Genia Kenton worked on this contracr - do you think you can find this. Thanks Elizabeth 
fyi thanks eas 
fyi thanks eas 
Sorry for the late RSVP, but I will be attending the drafting meetings on Tues. Thanks Elizabeth Sager Enron 
large thanks 
I wll be attending the meeting. Thanks Elizabeth Sager 
Jeff FYI 
Christian I'll fax my comments to you re this in the nest 30 minutes.  After you receive, call with any questions. 
John I'm not sure what their issue is but the CFTC issue related to thier interest in being able to terminate their purchase obligations for a price.  This is the type of provision we can't have in the contract because of CFTC 
John I'm not in on Friday so is there another day?  Also without wantingto be too bold, I will say that we have been down this path before and we just can't have a preestablished termination right (unless it is a Default) with 
brenda please print these thanks 
Robin Thanks for your voicemail - here is the final ERCOT Agreement. I'm still thinking of responding w more legal comments but at this point I think the door is pretty much shut.

As promised, here is a copy of what we filed -sorry for the delay - lots of travel recently. A question for you on the meetings on the 28th and 29th - I am assuming the meetings will be in DC. Is this correct? Thanks and I hope all is well. Elizabeth 
""A long time to wait"" - thats what Ella says all the time, only she's usually wrong and you are definitely right.  In the process of becoming dedicated to nothing but dispute resolution it appears I've lost my civility  .... imaging that  ..... becoming just like so many trial lawyers. How about Monday the 12th? 
Hi Geoff Sorry for the long delay - Things have been unbelievably hectic.  This week in looking better. Do you have any time this week to get together. How about Tuesday? Let me know what works. Elizabeth 
Here is a draft of where we are thinking of going with WSPP Firm.  Give me a call to discuss.  Thanks.  Elizabeth 713 853 6349. 
Attached is a first draft.  It is likely heavy handed but we can chop down from here (don't want to scare NERC away but need to set the record straight).

review 
Please print 
review Elizabeth and David, Mike Robison asked that I send you a listing of the counterparties that the Y2K team has classified as Mission Critical in order to perform a review of the contracts for these counterparties in connection with the Y2K project. The attached spreadsheet lists all of the Mission Critical counterparties.  I have them sorted by commodity so you can look for power.  Please note that there are 2 sheets in the file.  The first contains approximately 140 Mission Critical counterparties.  We also added about 60 more that we are assessing and these are listed on the sheet labeled ""Tier 2"".  There is a power list on that page as well.  If you have any questions on this information, please leave me a message as I will be out of the office starting tomorrow through Monday, July 27.  I will be checking messages while I am out on vacation. In addition, I am attaching the spreadsheet that we used to capture the results of our analysis of Houston gas contracts so you can see the format to use. 
Mark  FYI regarding Jim's new role. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
FYI Have a great day eas 
Privileged and Confidential.  Attoney Client Work Product. Attached is a draft letter for your consideration.  Our outside counsel believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the SDP because we know TVA will reject it.  Sending this letter is not critical to the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat.  Before deceiding to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today, re acces to transmission through third party transactions.  Lets discuss this afternoon. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
Hi Dennis called me to attempt to reschedule.  Conflicts in schedules led him to leave me a vm saying he will call me when he gaets back in the office next 
Thanks for your email.  I'll be out of the office for the rest of the week so when you find an answer, just let Bonnie (37422) White know.  Thanks. 
FYI - I'm out of the office the rest of this week, in on Monday and then out all the following week.  My assistant Brenda knows where I am.  If you need to reach me either leave me a vm and I'll return the call (I would love nothing more than to be execused from the painful standardized contract meetings I will be attending) or else call me on the cell phone 713 854 5747.  Bob Madden is the outside lawyer on the TVA MOPA and control area and you can call him at 713 650 8805 if you need to.  He is currently working on the declaratory judgement petition and is aware of the possible timeframe. Have a great week.

Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the slow and steady march towards a standardized, ""national"" agreement. Schedule C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the following is a summary of where the group is headed. After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.  The following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP group is currently reviewing: Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.  Seller shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under this definition. Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load; provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the ""optics"" are necessary to help traditional utilities).  As a further note, the group agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one Schedule. Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following discussions: 1.  Generated vs. Sold - ""Sold"" was elected over ""generated"" because the group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the generator's reserve requirements. 2. ""Schedule""  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements. 3.  ""Reserves"" instead of ""Operating Reserves"" was used because the group thought the word operating may be too restrictive. 4.  ""WSCC reserve requirements"" was replaced with ""applicable"" reserve requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in scope and should not be limited to WSPP. 5.  References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would accept a non-firm supply as being firm. 6.  Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision that has already been made. This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in Denver.

The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI Contract Standization Mailing List. Andy Katz sent out the following message...We have had many undeliverables...I would appreciate your letting me know if you receive this message...thanks. Working Group Members: The drafting commitee met on September 15 to discuss the status of the Master Agreement and the agenda for the October 13 meeting at EEI's offices.  The general consensus of the drafting committee is that the Master Agreement is sound and there is no need for revision to the base terms and conditions of version 2.1.  Based on that meeting, the drafting committee would like to cover the following at the October 13 meeting : GETTING CONTRACT IN PLACE.  The drafting committee believes that the number one priority is to get the Master Agreement used by more participants in the marketplace.   We would like to hear from the working group about the status of the Master Agreement in their organizations and issues about the contract that are holding up its use.  We will solicit suggestions on how to get wider acceptance of the Master Agreement.  The drafting committee has thought of holding another workshop in late January to address implementation issues such as establsihing credit thresholds. STANDARDIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS.  There are  several areas not addressed in the base contract that are frequently used as customized supplemental provisions identified on many parties' cover sheets.  The drafting committee identified the following as useful to develop as suggested optional supplemental provisions that could be used in negotiating a cover sheet with a counterparty:   (1)  the incorporation of prior transactions as being governed by the Master Agreement; (2) the use of the Master Agreement for electronic trading; (3) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; (4) treatment of new taxes or changes in regulatory policy; (5) additional products (e.g. Western firm or CAISO energy); (6) agreements with respect to agency relationships; (7) ""regulatory out"" provisions; and (8) provisions involving ""one-way"" counterparty relationships, i.e. sales only or purchases only. The drafting committee will ask the working group to allow it to develop these provisions and once consensus on language is reached among the drafting committee members, they would be made available for downloading on the EEI website for use by the industry as suggested optional provisions.  We will also discuss the ways to tie these provisions to the Master Agreement general terms. PROCEDURE FOR GETTING CONTRACT INTERPRETATION.  The drafting committee will discuss ways to get answers about the contract disseminated quickly.  One suggestion is to have a frequently asked questions section up on the EEI website. As a reminder, the meeting will be held from 10-4.  Please contact me if you have any questions or comments about the agenda.   If you plan to attend or need information about hotels or transportation, please contact Patricia Young at 202-508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org. Thank-you. Andrew S.

Hi Christian Thanks for the email and voicemail - look forward to seeing you in Oct. This EEI contract is a still a progress in work.  Last week's meeting resulted in still more changes. New draft is being prepared and will be distributed later this week.  Contract ""rollout"" is in Nov. Its raining here. First time in over two months.  I think I'll leave today in celebration. Sager

I have scheduled a meeting for October 7th from 8:30 to 2:30 in room 3321 to recommence the project we began in January to review the existing Houston-based financial, gas and power trading forms.  All of you should have received a black binder labelled ""Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas Forms""  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, assignement, confidentiality ....).  If you did not receive or cannot locate this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.  This analysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have changed since then but have not undertaken to ""update"" the memo as we will be able to discuss such changes at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based trading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences. The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's ""model"" trading provisions should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.  With this in mind, I would hope to be able to create a ""modular type"" contract  whereby each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language that will be approved by the group.  By way of example, Enron's gas contract prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any reason.  The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably withhold its consent.  At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.  This  ""modular assignment section"" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless differences were required due to the commodity/product involved. You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas of a trading contract.  Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with other provisions such as credit terms.  At the meeting, I hope to further discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed. Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer  from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to assist us in this effort. Thanks 
I rec'd notice and will be attending meeting as will David Portz with Enron. 
The WSPP operating/contract drafting committee is meeting on October 7 in Phoenix to discuss the reserve requirements for firm sales.  I would appreciate your review and comments on the following as a definition for Firm Power for use in the WSPP Agreement in lieu of the current language.  This language would be inserted in Schedule C and replace Sections C-3.3 and C-3.6: Firm Power shall be interrupted only if the interruption is: (a) due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement and power is not available at the Delivery Point; or, (b) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  If Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages for failure to deliver Firm Power as provided in Section 21.3 of this Agreement or in any Confirmation Agreement.  If Firm Power is interrupted for any reason other than as provided in subpart (a) above, the non-performing party shall be obligated to pay damages under this Agreement or Confirmation Agreement.

Hi John - You are in good company - I never call or write those I care about; only my ""enemies"" get to hear or see me.  And if that doesn't tell you how I spend my time, nothing will.  Now that summer is almost upon us (its only 92 degrees in Houston), I hope for more.  Give me a call and lets try to catch up this week. Hope all is well for you. Elizabeth 
This is likely the last opportunity we will have for comments, so if anybody has any additional comments, please let me know no later than the end of the day on Wed, Oct 13th, and I will forward all comments to Caroline on Thursday. Thanks for everybody's assistance on this effort. Elizabeth 
Attached is the latest draft  of  the Master Agreement (which includes changes from 9/24 meeting).  Please send your comments to Caroline Goodson asap, but no later than Friday October 15.

Please find attached for your review the most recent form of the above agreement, blacklined to show the changes to the previous draft distributed to you.  I believe that we have now settled on the form of the agreement, but there remain a few commercial issues which we will be resolving in the next week or so.  If anyone has any final comments on the form, please communicate them to me as soon as possible.  I would also like to have any input from Rob Hemstock and Aleck Dadson on any particular issues relating to market operations in Ontario or Alberta.  I also need someone in the Toronto office to provide me with the definition of ""Interval Meters"" that I have included as a potential delivery point.  I have left that definition as a bullet and we will need to fill it in or remove it, if the latter makes more sense. Finally, once the last few business issues are resolved next week, I would like to set up a call with Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager to obtain final internal legal approval on this agreement so that our commercial people can commence marketing the paper to potential counterparties.  Mark Powell will be using this form of the agreement in conjunction with the current ENA form of physical power GTC to prepare a Canadian form of physical power GTC that may be used to transact physical power transactions of less than one year in duration with counterparties with whom we do not have masters in place. Thanks Greg

Into Definition Conference Call 
Attached is the latest EEI contract for your review.  If you have any changes you think should be incorporated, please let me know before the the 16th of November. As you all are aware, I have been working with EEI to come up with the definition of an ""Into"" product.  I circulated a draft definition at the last EEI meeting.  There will be a conference call on Tuesday Nov.9th from 230 to 430 to further discuss with EEI members.  Let me know if you would like to participate.  In the meanwhile if you have any comments on the draft Into definition I circulated, please get me our comments as soon as possible.  I will be meeting with the traders later today to discuss with them. Thanks for everbody's help on this project.  The end may be near. 
The attached Master Purchase and Sale Agreement represents the culmination of a tremendous effort by the Standard Contract Working Group and Drafting Committee.  Every effort has been made to be as inclusive in the process of creating this document as possible.  Many compromises were made in creating this contract and  is not necessarily everyone's ideal agreement. Nevertheless, the contract should be a workable tool that hopefully will benefit the power market.  A clean and redline version of the contract are attached.  They were prepared by the Drafting Committee and every effort was made to include comments received during and since the September 24 meeting at EEI. At this stage of the initiative, it would not be productive to circulate non-substantive comments (word smithing/formatting).  On the other hand, it would be useful to send any substantive comments or questions about the mechanics of the contract and how the contract language might apply under certain scenarios.  The best forum to respond to your questions or comments will be the November 17 Power Marketing Transactions conference in Washington, D.C.   Accordingly, it would be helpful to tailor your comments to the conference program.  Questions, comments, and hypotheticals could be worked into the panel discussions.  Moreover, many of your colleagues from the Working Group will be on the panels or attending the conference.  For your convenience, a copy of the conference program is attached.  Send your comments to either Patty Dondanville, pdondanville@schiffhardin.com, or David Perlman, dmperlman@pwrsrc.com Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Andrew S.

Hi Thanks for the feedback - you never know how things are rec'd when you standing for 90 minutes in front of a crowd of credit numbers guys, in a dark room with slides that are barely legible, taking about a contract that only a lawyer could love ... OK tolerate.  I'll send you the presentation by mail. Hopefully I didn't get too carried away. Looking forward to seeing you Friday. 
Christi Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would like more information (Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties) *EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar has been assigned the matter. *The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA). *The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue. *A trial date in late June 2000 has been set. *EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999. 
As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a manner similiar to other control areas. One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary damages against TVA  for TVA's breach of NERC policies.  In order to make such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC policies are a ""contract"" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.  One concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could possibly be damaged in other, unrelated  proceedings if it was determined that NERC policies were indeed ""contractual obligations"" (e.g., a third party claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC ""contractual policies""). It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me with any thoughts or comments you have. Thanks for your help. Elizabeth 36349 
Patty and Harlan I received your emails. 1. I agree with Patty that I'm not sure the first section of the agenda is relevant other than in connection with the product descriptions. 2. I would like to add the Unit Contingent definition as a discussion point. 3. My apologies given, but I'm still working on the revised draft of the INTO definition.  I promise that it will be avaiable no later than early Monday. If at all possible, I will try to get it out earlier but I can't promise given current work committments.  I will let you know by Thursday afternoon if it looks like earlier is doable. Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Athough I know that PECO had a variety of questions about the interplay of the FERC transmission policies and the force majeure definition at the Nov. 18 meeting, I think we should keep the Houston session focussed on the Products definitions first, and only deal with the force majeure definition as it relates to the other products definitions.  If PECO wants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERC policy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on the agenda, and certainly not first. I think it would be very important to attach current products definitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Marty to see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution by Friday.  Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firm definition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massaged and to Andy by Friday morning. I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about the 
Into product should be distributed to Andy and Patricia Young.  Emails in this email 
Draft Definitions should go to all the peole on this email both as ""to"" and ""cc"". 
Good point.  I agree.  We should take that item off of the agenda. 
Can you send him a hard copy (He is w Constellation)  thanks 
I have heard great things about your presentation in Marco Island - any 
Here are materials I recieved from EEI in anticipation of the EEI product description meeting on Wed.   I would guess that the bulk of the meeting will be spent on the ""Into"" definition, which draft was prepared by David and myself, but we will also need to provide requested alterations to the other product definitions (unit firm and system firm).  If you have any questions/thoughts about the Into definiton, please call either David or me. 
Attached is the agenda and draft revised  definitions for the ""into"" and ""system reliability"" products.  These files are in Rich Text Format. As part of our discussion of the product definitions, we will discuss the effect of transmission curtailments on the parties' obligation to perform. We want to focus on the words on the page in Schedule P.   If anyone thinks the words on the page do not accurately reflect the business people's understanding of the allocations of risk and responsibilities in trading that product, please let them come to Houston with alternative WORDS that they feel better reflect the business relationships that exist in the marketplace.  The goal of the Houston meeting is to have  FINALIZED the WORDS, so that the document is ready to present to the industry and FERC. We will convene at 10 am and adjourn at 4pm.  Lunch will be provided. Dynegy's offices are located in Houston at 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800.  If you need directions or information about hotels, please contact Michelle Cantu,  at Dynegy, 713/ 767-5981. If you plan to attend, please inform Patricia Young at EEI, 202/508-5757,  or respond to this message by using your e-mail program's ""ReplyTo"" function by COB MONDAY.  If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach Patricia at 202/508-5757 or Andy Katz at 202/508-5616. Andrew S. Katz, Senior Attorney Edison Electric Institute 701 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.

Attached is a preliminary draft of the letter prepared by Gibbs & Bruns notifying TVA of the occurrence of a Triggering Event and EMPI's suspension of deliveries under the MOPA.  Please review and call me with any questions or comments.  We will need to carefully consider EPMI's offer to provide energy under the MOPA at market based rates.  As you are aware,  the current plan is to send TVA  notice on Jan. 4th. The draft of the control area  petition should be ready for circulation on Tuesday, the 28th.   Once received, I will forward both the petition and a revised draft of this letter to legal, regulatory and trading for review. CONFIDENTIAL/ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVLEDGE 
(Moosehead) 
(Moosehead) As we discussed, attached is my draft of a confirmation under the Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.  In addition to the comments/questions noted within the Confirmation itself, I have the following thoughts/questions: 1) Note that the Enron Corp Guaranty is currently limited to an aggregate amount of $30,000,000 (this may become an issue late in the day when the folks over at Merrill figure out that this is one of the disadvantages to using a confirm as opposed to doing a sep. transaction with a separate and distinct Enron Corp. Guaranty); 2) Per Section 1.1 of the Master, in the event of any conflicts between the Master and a Confirm for a particular transaction, the Confirm governs; 3) Section 1.4 of the Master Agreement makes reference to a ""Qualified Financial Contract"" - is that applicable to this Transaction?  Might this somehow cause the accountants to treat the Transaction differently?; 4) Do we need to negate the reference to a ""Forward Contract"" in Section 4.6 of the Master (Elizabeth we spoke about a concern that you had regarding this exact issue); 5) What changes should be made to the Confirm given the agreed to changes in the ISDA (Severability and Notice Update for example); 6) The last sentence of the Master appears to be missing some language.  It currently reads ""Disallowance of cost pass-through or any unfavorable or any Affiliate of the Non-Defaulting Party shall not constitute a requirement for a change to the terms of this Agreement.""; 7) Should we still eliminate the last portion of Section 8.1(ii) of the Master to permit free assignment to an Affiliate (this previously was a big issue given our concern that we might have to assign certain rights to an Affiliate in the event of a bankruptcy).  Section 8.1(ii) currently reads: Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion; provided, however, either Party may, without the consent of (but with notice to) the other Party (and without relieving itself from liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement and all Transactions hereunder as a whole or the accounts, revenues or proceeds hereof as a whole in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party; provided, that such Party's Credit Support Provider issues a Credit Support Document substantially in the form provided in connection with the execution hereof,; 8) The draft of the Confirmation does not make reference to any of the 3 ""Facilities"".  Does it have to for acct purposes even though the only time that it was used was in the sections deal with gas supply (which did not make it into the Confirmation) and Section 6.2 of the prior physical agreement which used to make ""Buyer responsible for charges imposed on the delivery of Energy from a given Facility but related to the operation of third party transmission"" (this provision is not reflected in the Master and I suspect that Merrill would object strongly to its incorporation); 9) Did we ever determine whether the draft of the Confidentiality Agreement that I prepared was executed by Merrill?; and 10) The Master currently defines Stranded Costs but does not contain the standard provision regarding the same (should this be introduced???)

Attached please find the latest credit worksheets for the physical and financial transactions between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. The credit worksheet for the physical transaction is in the form of a specific confirmation that will be confirmed under the existing Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services. The credit worksheet for the financial transaction is in the form of a new ISDA Master Swap Agreement.  Per Bill Bradford, please note that Credit approval for both worksheets are contingent upon legal approval by Mark Haedicke of the physical and financial setoff/netting assumption. I have requested and am waiting approval from Jeff McMahon to accept the counterparty's request to set the third party cross-default amount of $50,000,000.  For the purposes of these credit worksheets, the amount proposed remains at $100,000,000 for both parties. Please call should you have any questions, x3-0554.

Pursuant to my recent conversation with Rodney Malcolm, I am detailing below newly negotiated terms that have been accepted by Credit in regards to the contracts/confirms for the Merrill Lynch physical and financial transactions: on behalf of EPMI, Enron Corp. will provide a $60MM guaranty to Merrill Lynch Capital Services covering exposures under both Master contracts (either amend existing $30MM physical guaranty or supersede existing guaranty with a new guaranty) usage of the the stair-step Threshold that is currently in the Credit Support Annex (Paragraphe 13) of the existing Master power contract will remain effective for the specific power confirmation.  However, the valuation of the parties' exposure will be defined as exposures under the existing physical power Master agreement as well as the new financial ISDA Master.  [both the physical confirmation and the ISDA Master will need to reference this stair-step Threshold provision that will govern margin calls under both transactions] deletion of the investment grade MAC for both credit worksheets (replaced by stair-step Threshold discussed above) third party cross-default amounts:  Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. is $100MM and Enron Corp. is $50MM (contingent upon approval by Andy Fastow or Jeff McMahon.  I have left a voice message and an email for Jeff McMahon requesting approval of the third-party cross-default exception.) Tracy x3-0554

The Drafting Committee will meet on Janurary 13 at EEI's offices to develop consensus language for products definitions in the Contract.  This would be in preparation for a meeting of the entire working group in Houston on either Janurary 25 or 26.    We would like to have Reliant, Dynegy, and PECO serve on the drafting committee since your companies' have concrete proposals on the table.  Several of you have already indicated that you will be available for this meeting, will the others please let me know your availability. Thanks. Have a great holiday and a Happy New Year! Andrew S.

Hi Give me a call about Duke's changes.  I also disagree w (ii) and really think even (i) is wrong since an Option can either be in the money or out of the money and in either case the full value should be taken and netted against other Gains and Losses. Happy New Year

At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of the MOPA. The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings. 
Attached is a memo from Julia about a meeting going over some of the deals, including power deals, that were closed last year.  Background information on the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be administered by power trading.  Let LindaNoske  know if you can make it (lunch will be served) 
Elizabeth,  you appear to have inadvertently been left off the list.  Ooops! Hope that you and your folks can attend the session. You may want to let Linda Noske know if you can attend the session so that she has an approximate headcount.  Thanks.  Julia 
Attached are the final documents on the UI deal.  Upon receipt of original execution pages we will be preparing closing books containing all of the documents. Dan Allegretti is compiling the relevant regulatory materials which will be required to administer this deal on an ongoing basis. CJG

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE By letter dated January 24th, TVA rejected  EPMI's offer to continue performance under the MOPA at market prices.   Accordingly, we sent a letter to TVA today, January 25th, at 4:00 notifying TVA that (1) EPMI was suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Thursday, January 27th and (2) EPMI intended to exercise its termination rights unless TVA agreed to our proposal to continue performance under the MOPA pending a judicial determination of whether a Triggering Event occurred under the MOPA.

Elizabeth, Could you please review Alabama Power's attached Terms and Conditions.  All bidders must clearly state exceptions to these T&Cs in their offer.  They say any exceptions will affect the value of the offer to Southern. In addition, you should have received last week three summaries regarding interconnection structures with Southern at Caledonia.  That interconnection review you are doing and this review of the T&Cs are necessary for us to bid on the RFP on Feb. 24th.  So if you could get back to me on Feb. 18st, that will give me a few days to formulate a proposal.  Also, depending on what you think the feasibility of an interconnection is, I may not submit a proposal at all since it costs $10,000 to propose. Thanks for your assistance, please do not hesitate to call me with your thoughts - Mike 
Have a great weekend eating soggy hotdogs in misty, damp weather, dreaming of Genia on her cruise, all the while wondering about the meaning of quality time.  See you Monday am, not sharp.

Each start after 50/yr will have a $1500 per start charge. 2.

Kellie, Attached is the term sheet you delivered to us with our revisions.  Please review and incorporate changes and re-submit for final review and pricing. 
Enclosed is a revised Term Sheet, one copy of which has been marked to show changes from Fred's last draft. The Term Sheet is intended to be in no way binding;  references to  the proposal being held  ""open"" have been deleted.  Also, I have not attempted to include any reference to SD Warren having the right to receive the financial benefits if EPMI resells the Power not used by SD Warren to NEPOOL at a price higher than the Contract Price (CFTC concerns). Dan - Could you please help me fix the definition of ""Green Requirement"". Fred - I wanted to stick to ""would"" instead of ""will""  as the operative verb in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal. If you have any questions or comments, please call me.  I will not be in the office on Friday.  In my absence, please call Leslie Hansen at 36121. Elizabeth 36349 
Fred I don't think we have to wait, but if time permits we might as well fix. 
As discussed at the 1/26 Working Group meeting, I am circulating minutes of the meeting we had with the FERC staff regarding tariff/filing/reporting issues related to the Master Contract.  In sum, the meeting was very successful in that the staff does not expect their requirements to impose a burden on the utilization of the Standard Contract.  If you have further questions, please feel free to contact me. Andrew S. Katz, Senior Attorney Edison Electric Institute 701 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.

Shari and Elizabeth, We revised our CAISO language to address the 10 minute pricing implemented recently.  See attached.  Do you plan to change your language also?  As you can see, I took the easy way out and did not reference either the 10 minute price or the Hourly Ex Post Price -- I just said the price paid to CAISO by the Buyer.  Do you think this works? -Dede (See attached file: CAISO LANGUAGE 092500.doc)

At the request of Christi, enclosed please find a revised draft of EPMI's response to TVA's recent  letter concerning  EPMI's transmission requests. This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from Kevin and me.  I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this afternoon if possible Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
Andy As we discussed during  the last conference call, attached is a revised Article 8,  Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised section for the Cover Page.  The changes were made to make Article 8 more user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed  to during the conference call.  I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable due to the extensive formatting changes.  Maybe you will have better success.  I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group. The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows: 1.  Changed  the Section entitled ""Performance Assurance"" to ""Collateral Threshold"" - Use of PA seemed  misleading since PA is referenced in other sections dealing with collateral. 2. Added the words ""acceptable to Party ___"" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)  that the security must be acceptable to the receiving party. 3. Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the options are ""Applicable"" or ""Not Applicable"". As always thanks for your help. Elizabeth 713.853.6349

Elizabeth -- This letter is excellent.  Attached I added several suggestions.  Primarily, I suggest adding to the begining paragraph a few words and a sentence to put into perspective what is going on for the quick reader.  Also, on the mention of FERC, I suggested a ( ) to place into context and lighten the sting.  Lastly, when you use ""Commercial"" I suggest using ""commercially reasonable"" if that would be the ultimate standard applied.  Just suggestions -- use as you like.

please call me w any final comments 
confirmation process 
A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains ""substantive"" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the ""deemed accepted"" language.  I have been very vocal against  adding this language. The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much of successful politics, dirty.  I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless objected to in a timely manner). I will keep everybody posted on the results of the vote. 
I am passing on the following message from Patty expressing her concern with today's decision to limit the choice on the ballot to optional language or no language.  Cutting through the ""edge"" of her comments, no doubt brought on by the frustration of being outvoted, I believe she has some valid points on our process here.  I have avoided  taking a position on substantive questions regarding the contract, but I too have a process concern  which I have raised with some of you individually.  I apologize for not vocalizing these concerns this morning.  Nevertheless, this is what I intend to do .  Given that Mitch was not available for the discussion and knowing Mitch's position on this issue compels me to release the comments he wanted circulated before going on vacation.  If there is a consensus from the balloting that the language should be included, but not as an option or as an ""opt out"" provision, this drafting committee should respect that sentiment. The attention of many members of the Drafting Committee has waned and EEI members (electric utilities which conduct wholesale power transactions) are no longer represented on the Drafting Committee. Mitch, in his email, did not think EEI member views were considered on the Tuesday call.  And today's call  by Constellation, Enron, EPMC (and Jones, Day and Schiff) did not even include any EEI members... The language compromise I accept, and believe that Mitch would accept, in the spirit of Drafting Committee give and take.  But let's not kid ourselves.  Today, a few members of the Drafting Committee made a decision that even Mitch (the only EEI member on the Tuesday call) did not think we had made or would make.  Read his email.  Today's decision was to not even ""allow"" the EEI members' vote to be heard  to choose what they overwhelmingly chose in Houston --- that is, to have the provision in Section 2.3 of the Contract --- not just an option on the Cover sheet). Today's decision is just wrong. As the person who was standing in the front of the room in Houston, I feel strongly  that I know what occurred, and what Comed, Dynegy,  Cinergy, IPALCO, AEP, Ameren and Toni Frost's group of utilities, among others, know they voted on.   I am the person that folks are going to call to ask why their views were ignored.  I had become comfortable with the explanation for the revote --- to either not add the language at all, add to 2.3, or add as an option.  But now Working Group is not being given the choice  to vote as they did, like the result or not, in Houston.  Even Fritz's suggestion that three choices be given on the ballot was ignored.  Those three choices, as I understood it, would have included an even more aggressive elimination of the 2 business day presumption that the confirm, as sent, controls. The question I asked...  why we are afraid of even giving the Working Group the choice to express the same views they expressed in Houston...was never answered. When  EEI members call me to ask about this, I intend to suggest that they vote ""YES"" on the ballot, and then  add an admonition to their ballot that the language be included in 2.3 and not just be an option on the cover sheet.  I would hope that the Drafting Committee (or whoever remains on it) would at least consider such added comments although, again, after today I have my doubts.  I intend to call some of the EEI members that I know will feel strongly about this.  Since I know Mitch will not be around (and don't feel he should be disenfranchised), I also intend to call AEP as a courtesy.  I no longer support the idea of not forwarding Mitch's email to the whole group, as he obviously intended. Ironically or perhaps intentionally, the Drafting Committee's failure to address this directly until almost a month after the Houston meeting means people won't even have a 2 Business Day voting window. Nonetheless, regardless of the vote, I intend to discuss this in the implementation discussion in the Houston/New York seminars. Andrew S.

Attached is a form of Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement.  I believe that the provisions that you are looking for are contained in Section 3.5. The only concern I have is that the attached may not be the latest and greatest EPMI trading form (although I am reasonably comfortable that the cover damage language will not need a substantial overhaul).  There have been numerous discussions about this form being revised.  By carbon copy of this email, I am requesting that Elizabeth Sager forward to each of us, the latest and greatest form if it has been finally agreed upon. Stuart

I made the following changes to these hypotheticals as I understand the changes made to the product: Example #1 3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  Entergy is sinking in Cinergy. Seller must move to another interface (either on  Cinergy's border (NIPSCO, LG&E, AEP. . .) or in Cinergy's control area (Wabash) at which Buyer can receive energy such that energy can sink in Cinergy.  Seller can require Buyer to purchase Non-Firm transmission (or Firm, if available) but each party will be responsible for any additional transmission costs incurred to reschedule to another delivery point. Ex #2 3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's notification and receives response that Firm is available.  Buyer purchases Non-Firm instead.  Entergy is sinking in Cinergy. Ex #3 3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission from Cinergy within 30 minutes of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer. Buyer also secures Firm transmission from LG&E to sink energy in LG&E. There are references to specific sections in the product definition, I don't know if they are still valid in light of the latest changes. Could someone help me out before 4pm Eastern?  Thanks.

Elizabeth & Janet: Attached is a draft of the memo we spoke about the other day.  We tried to come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial desire to put in the second interconnect.  As we have discussed, certain language in the Interconnect Agreement is troublesome, generally due to the fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at the time the project was initially developed.  Nonetheless, we believe that Caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block. The strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places in the memo. Please let me know when you wish to follow up.  And, as I noted in my conversation with Elizabeth this morning, there is a possibility I may be in Houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that time.  I think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the TVA ""history"" and likely responses of TVA to some of the arguments noted in the memo.

Elizabeth: Per Paul Racicot's voicemail to you, please find attached a draft power supply agrreement between Enron and New Hampshire Electric Coop.  (Reference to PSEG in the message body must have been inadvertant).  Tracy Ngo ran a credit check on them and found they have been running a deficit, but didn't see that as a problem since we are purchasing non-LD unit contingent power from them. We need to have comments to them by noon Eastern, 11 Am Houston time. Thanks very much for your help, and I'll need to swing by and introduce myself next time I'm down in Houston.  I can be reached today, over the weekend, or Monday at the following numbers: Office:   978-449-9936 Home:  978-448-9260 If neither of these work, then: Cell:  978-314-5614 Pager:  877-246-3206 Regards, John 
Attached for your review and comment is a draft Power Supply Agreement between PSEG and NHEC.  This draft reflects Enron's most recent offer for the period July 2000 throughAugust 2000.  Please have your comments on this draft to me by noon on Monday, March 13.  Please plan to be available during the afternoon of March 13 for further discussions with NHEC. If you have any questions, please call. - 8QHY01!.DOC 
Here is the Formosa Term Sheet that spells out a straight-forward tolling arrangement.  After further discussion, I have eliminated sharing options. We will use this as a starting point and if Formosa insists on a sharing alternative, we will address that at that point.

What's the deal, Michigan vs. Duke? Cox and SagerII? If Arizona does anything in the final, SagerI has it nailed.  Arizona any good? 
Per keegan's vm, here is the only thing we handed out.  Let me know if you want to discuss. 
At Elizabeth Sager's request, attached please find an electronic version of the ISDA chart discussed at the meeting this week. Please feel free to contact me at (713) 853-6121 with any questions or comments. Regards, Leslie Hansen 
I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport only to be intimidated by the words ""no less than a 4 hour wait""   (on hard floors) . Any advice?  Your experience certainly must have been better. 
Dear Gail wants a party at a house.  If you remember we volunterred if kids came. Gail said kids or no kids, whatever we wanted. what do you think? Kids (ours plus katie and oscar and eleanor) at our house on Sat.  Punt to Ted w/no kids? 
A number of parts of the deal making process are flying around at the same time and for the purpose of communicating to the team where legal sees the matter at this point I offer the following: Apparently Greg Whalley has not yet signed the one month DASH. Credit has requested that legal put a MAC clause in the one month confirm before the DASH is resubmitted to Whalley. West Desk traders (Greg Wolfe and Mike Etringer) report that Kaiser's power guys in Spokane are saying that we can ""sleeve""  the power to them through Bonneville.  To legal, this means we sell power to BPA no strings attached and assume nothing about who they resell it too. Obviously a clean one month sale to BPA is attractive.  But can it be detached from the larger call spread transaction?  I don't know.  Given this quandry, Greg Wolfe has advised me to hold off temporarily on preparing the one off confirmation  until the BPA option is sorted out.  I am following this sensible guidance and if anybody has a thought to the contrary please give me a call:  503-464-7845.  ----cgy 
This is another aggregator that'll be participating in the TVA 5% program. They may have as much as 400MW of load.  We need to steer this contract in the same direction as the other ones. 
Mike Danielson Elizabeth Sager Attached are the documents Mike and I discussed. 1) Fact Sheet provided by TVA 2) Draft Master Purchase Agreement between Valley Energy and your company 3) Sample Confirmation Letter for Transactions under the Agreement Valley Energy Corporation will be acting as purchase agent for an aggregated group of TVA power distributors totaling about 400 MW.  We will be purchasing blocks of 5 x 16 liquidated damages firm energy each week. The minimum block size will be 25 MW delivered to the TVA control area. The Draft Master Purchase Agreement reflects the requirements and constraints placed on us as a participant in the TVA program. Valley energy is in the process of obtaining a Line of Credit to satisfy the credit requirements of our supplier counterparties.  We are also interested in similar protection for situations where liquidated damages may be due from our suppliers. Please review the attached documents and provide me with feedback as soon as possible. Our objective is to be able to conduct business by April 6, 2000, which is the first day TVA will allow us to participate.  Power purchased on April 6 would be for delivery beginning April 10, 2000. Call if you have questions. Thank you very much, - ValleyEnergyConfirmation.doc - masterpurchase-3-22-00.doc - FACT SHEET - WETM1.doc Jack W. Simmons Valley Energy Corporation 423 266 1885 
, Elizabeth: Here is a set of documents which might be useful as a starting point for your situation.  The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") and three California UDC's would divert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP into the infamous ""Lockbox.""  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent ""Security Interest"" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds and this security interest was for our benefit. Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox concept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal using the damn thing.

Hello Elizabeth: Hope all is well down in Houston.  I have attached a market based electric purchase/sales tariff for New England Power Company that I was hoping you could provide a legal review of.

FYI in case you hadn't already heard 
All: I wanted to give you a heads-up that we have been shortlisted to negotiate with New Hampshire Electric Coop (NHEC) on supplying their load requirements from Sep-00 through May-01.   Attached is a table that sets forth the monthly quantities and our indicative pricing (will be refreshing pricing based on updated forwards).  They have decided not to go with the purchase for Jul-Aug at this time.  They seem to have gotten their act a little better together this time around with pre-approvals internally, but any deal they do would still need to be approved by the NHPUC. Here's the scoop on timeline: They will send to us a draft contract this Friday for review/comment.  We need to have our comments back to them by Weds Apr 5th.  Elizabeth, does this fit your schedule OK? They plan to hold negotiations with us and other parties via phone on Monday Apr 10th, and hope to close  a deal that same day.  Again, this deal would be subject to NHPUC approval, so we need to get a feel for the risk of NHPUC disapproval. Tracy - as you know, they are not so attractive from a credit standpoint. Is letter of credit sufficient in their case?  Can we talk about what we need to put in place for the transaction. I will be in Houston on Weds-Fri of this week (Elizabeth and Tracy -- I'll be sure to swing by and introduce myself).  Thanks much and I'll forward the contract when I get it. Regards, John 
Hi Gave Jackie's resume to Mark Taylor.  Did he call her yesterday? 
Hi Susan How's things going?  I hope at least OK if not well. Delete my rambling voice mail if you haven't heard it . Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.  We would, of course, love to come to your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well (wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after all it is your party - mine's next).  Let me know what you think. 
Hi Dede I got your email about NY seminar. Great idea but sorry we can't be of much help - I haven't touched EEI since the Houston seminar.  I know its time to start trying to use it.  Oh well, next week's project. On a more important note, do you want to try and hit this Tuesday (the 4th) at lunch?  Let me know. Hope you have fun on Friday night. Elizabeth 
As we discussed, attached is a draft of an agreement for Valley Energy.  This agreement assumes that Valley Energy would buy power from EPMI and resell it to the distributors who have signed an agreement with TVA.  Call me at 713 853 6349 if you have any questions or comments. Thanks 
John I got your email regarding our sale to NHEC.  I will be out of the office March 31, and April 3, 6, 7.  When you get the draft contract, please forward it ASAP to Brenda Whitehead, my assistant, and Leslie Hansen.  Depending upon the timing and the extent of the comments either me, Leslie or another lawyer will be able to help you with this.  The timing may be awkward because all Enron lawyers will in San Antonio next week, but we will work it out.  Once I see the draft, I will have a better feel for the timing. Talk to you soon Elizabeth 
Hi John Thanks for the email re TVA.  As usual, things got behind me last week so I wasn't able to move the TVA letter forward.  I have  promised Kevin something by today - so I may be calling you this afternoon. Hope all is well

Janette Mark had asked me to call Williams and invite them to the ISDA Energy meeting in Houston last week.  Tim at Williams very much wanted to participate.  As you can see from his email, he must not be on the distribution list for ISDA.  Can you see if it is OK to add him to the distribution list for future meetings.  Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master for all trades.  I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you. Thanks for your help. Elizabeth 36349 PS Mark At the EEI meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades.  It seems that there is alot of interest in this idea. 
Elizabeth, Is it possible that we can be included on future mailings/meetings of the North America Energy and Developing Products Committee - due to the late notice of the last meeting on 10/10 in Houston we were unable to send a representative.  We will, with ample notice, attempt to send a representative to future meetings as Williams has an interest in the topics that would be discussed.  Thanks for your assistance.

Hi Just FYI - A collection of racquets is more than just a luxury.  On Friday, after the matches, I was keen to assert my new found tennis prowess.   I thought I could do it too.  I was playing like a spring chicken until my first big overhead.  I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over Grant's head.  I thought I was so cool.  Up I  went to find the ball and out came flying my  racquet.  On the other side of the net.  Cracked.  Everybody stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a mess.  I think I better work on that shot. Tennis on Wed.? 
There is no guarantor for NHEC.  I have not received the form of LC.  Issuing bank is National Rural Utility Coop Finance Corp. Thanks 
thanks 
Hi Tim Thanks for your message.  We absolutely will forward to ISDA your message so that you can receive notices of the Energy Product meetings ( I thought you were already getting them).  Look forward to seeing you again soon. Elizabeth 
Oops forgot to respond to this request. It would be absolutely fine to use our arbitration language as an example for the Cover Sheet.  My only suggestion would be to leave blank the place for the arbitration (I've gotten untold grief for using HOUSTON).

I agree w Tracy - the Calpine master is legally sufficient for trades and our relationship w Calpine is sensitive.  We do not need to push the EEI Master unless they want it in which case we are happy to oblige.

Hi How about Tuesday at 1130 ( I'm meeting with all Enron power traders on Tuesday at 400 to explain the EEI contract - oh boy, that will be a blast). If that doesn't work I can also play on Wed. 
All: I received an RFP from Northeast Utilities for sale of peaking plant entitlements to which I would like to respond (respose due Fri 5/12).  A requirement for any transaction coming out of this process is that the winning buyer must be signed on to NU's Tariff 7 (mkt based rate tariff).

Hi Brent Hope all is well. I received your email.  In the US we do physical power puts and calls, usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).  The confirmation for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all the other general terms and conditions. By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group. Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston (Thanks Leslie) Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/04/2000 09:43 AM 
The commercial team in Sao Paulo is getting creative and I have been asked to find out if EPMI has ever created or used a physical power put or call option form.  Do we have any forms that I could give to the attorneys in Sao Paulo to review?  I appreciate any help you can give me.  Thanks, Brent

FYI 
Michael I received a call from your attorney a few days ago; she was  inquiring about the status of the draft of the power sales agreement.  .  I misplaced her number; therefore I did not get back to her.  Please apologize to her for me.  We have not spent much time with your draft because we feel our positions are so far apart that  NES's time was better spent working with those suppliers that understood the program and were comfortable with the program.  We have one contract signed and are negotiating with two other suppliers.  Is there any point to sending ENRON a copy of the agreement NES is will to sign or has ENRON decided it has very little interest in the program as it is structured? 
A meeting regarding the TEPAC project has been scheduled for Wednesday, May 10, 2000 in EB2935 from 1:30 - 3:30 p.m. Thank you, Maxine Levingston (5-8683)

FYI 
Attached is a draft of a PPA/Tolling Agreement that we were negotiating last year in connection with the potential disposition of our 99 Peaking Assets. I believe you have seen this one before (in fact, I my memory serves my correctly you provided significant input).  I hope this is helpful. Stuart 
I can provide chapter and verse if you need it, but thought just making the 
This is the subject of the meeting w Larry for 230 today on 31 in control room 
Elizabeth, we discussed this matter intenally yesterday, witht he following conclusions: We want to be able to apply Gleason Network credits to all transmission costs (from all  TVA-related control areas) We want to be able to go negative on application of the credits - when network upgrade invoices to Gleason have not  yet caught up to transmission credit requests from all of the control areas. We do not want to make a monthly declaration of transmission requirements. We need to agree with TVA on a process to keep track  of the credit usage and balance. We would like to go over them with you in our 2:30 pm meeting today - at the controol room conference table. Larry. 
Larry: Please make sure folks are up to speed on this. In any current month, the amount of the transmission credit is equal to the then current amount of capital costs paid by Gleason to TVA for the Shleby upgrade, less any transmission credits previously used. I think the way to go is first to see if we can use the credits to offset transmission charges from our other TVA plants (on this point, TVA said no, but since Luke is out of the picture, we should make another run at this). If that does not fly, (that is, if the amount of credits we can use in any month is limited to the transmission charges otherwise due from Gleason on the power it generates), we obviously want to make sure we designate a credit amount equal to only as much as we actually need. Given that I believe we are the first IPP to be in this situation with TVA, and given that TVA is to repay us in 2009 for the actual cost of the Shelby upgrade less transmission credits actually used, we also need to make sure we are accurately tracking both upgrade costs and transmission credits used, and that TVA agrees with what we believe to be the correct balance. Jody Pierce and Amy Copeland are aware of this, but I caution that we need to be extremely careful given the amount of money involved. Toward this end, I have asked Jody and Amy to make sure each TVA Shelby upgrade invoice is adequately labelled as such by TVA before we make payments. I strongly suggest we put in place a similar system for transmission credits whereby we receive TVA signoff as part of the process Dennis To references below. Please follow up with Jody, Amy, and Lloyd to make sure everyone is up to speed on this as we proceed, and please make sure that an adequate process is set up to account for transmission charges, credits, and balance of Shelby upgrade costs. Thanks much, Ben ""To, Dennis P."" <dpto@tva.gov> on 05/12/2000 02:56:14 PM 
Janice You could help Christi et all on this Thanks Elizabeth 
Elizabeth--Can you all look this over and let Dick I. know if it is OK. Thanks. 
No one will be audited at this time but I just wanted to see if the agreement would be acceptable to us in the future. 
What would FRCC be auditing Enron for or on?  L:et me know, then I'll show this to ENA legal. Richard Ingersoll 05/17/2000 12:50 PM 
Is this OK 
Attached is the audit confidentiality agreement we used in our audit process last year.  As I mentioned, it did have legal review by several of the audit team member companies, and all of our team members signed it.  Hope it helps. Linda - Confidential Agreement 6-7.pdf

David Could you please look at this? Thanks Elizabeth 
I am buried at the moment.  Could you take a look at this? 
Hi John Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual interconnect with Southern. In the next week or so we will give them a call. On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to let us go ""commercial"" sooner than they otherwise would be required to. Maybe this is a thawing of relations.  Just dreaming. Talk to you soon. Hope all is well.

Leslie Can you please forward to the appropriate person 
Can you print this? 
The June 1 issue of PUF contains an article about the Master Contract.  The reporter interviewed me and Richard McMahon, another EEI staffer, after our NY workshop.  The reporter promised that I would see the article before publication.  This never occured.  Had I had seen it I would have tried to correct several errors.   At the outset, I want to apologize for the mischarcterization of me and Richard McMahon as ""architects"" of the contract.   The true architects are the many industry representatives who devoted their time, energy, and company resources to participating in the year and a half drafting process.  EEI's role was only as a facilitator; hosting meetings; disseminating information, and sponsoring our series of contract workshops. I intend to correct this error in a letter to the editor. Andrew S.

Below is the Entergy contact.  I will get back to you asap on how the desk intends to trade off the WSPP so you can prepare a memo for the traders. Thanks, - Mike 
Mike - I just spoke to my contact at Entergy.  They have moved exclusively to the WSPP contract to streamline their contracts department and protect them against inconsistent contractual language.  They are not bending on this requirement at this time.  As such, I think we need to proceed with signing this agreement unless there are any significant issues. Could you coordinate the execution with legal ( I think E. Sager was working on this).  Arlyn Kelleher is the contact on Entergy's side.  Her # is 281-297-3582. Kevin, Kyle, Elizabeth - are there any significant issues that would prevent us from executing this contract?  We need them as a counterparty and I do not think sleeving is the answer. Thanks, Rogers

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication Not Discoverable Hi Tim Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still have relating to PCA. PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable). Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such amounts received from PCA back to you. Call me if you have any questions. Thanks Elizabeth

Confidential; Attorney client work product; Not discoverable Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if we get any ""cap"" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.

Hi Shari, Christian asked me to review these inc/dec examples.  I think these are an excellent idea and will be very helpful to your counterparties in understanding how the Adjustment Payment works in combination with inc/dec pricing. I made some corrections to the examples, which I have attached as a redline document so that you can see what I did.  You will also see that I added a few words here and there to clarify things.  The other document is a clean version incorporating all of the proposed changes from the redlined document. Steve SHARI STACK 10/24/2000 05:19 PM

a followup note on this deal from Kevin Presto Regards, Janice EB3861 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-4842) 
John, We need to make sure we are valuing the spread option using only No. 2 oil in Dec, Jan & Feb.  We will almost certainly be curtailed during blow out events in the winter and, therefore, it is not appropriate to use nat gas as the winter fuel. 
Do you suppose that Shari could handle this for John today?  This is the first I've seen of the term sheet, and I haven't even taken the time to read it, so I'm not even sure exactly what this deal is.  ""Tolling"" means so many different things..............  Shari sent this company an EEI Master this summer and has been bugging them about it but w/ no response (according to the database).  Maybe this would be a good opportunity to advance that......... And I'm still working on the Maine SOS proposal, and VPPSA and the N. Carolina project that David Fairley wants comments on yesterday, as well as the Reedy Creek stuff that came up as a rush yesterday afternoon (I've left you a vmail on that). Regards, Janice EB3861 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-4842) 
Attached is an indicative term sheet I shared with the customer yesterday relating to the referenced tolling transaction.  Preliminary feedback from the customer has been positive, so I am hopeful that we will come to mutually agreeable pricing and terms on this transaction.   I should get some additional feedback sometime today. I have raised the flag with the customer that we need to put paper and credit terms in place, and given their desire to close on this quickly, we will likely need to move quickly on this today/tomorrow.   As for cedit, their consultant indicated that a corp guarantee from the Black Hill Power Corp parent is probably not the customer's preferred approach, but rather credit arrangements tagged specifically to the project.  The project is owned by Black Hills Energy Capital, which invests in power projects through some sort of investment fund.  Their consultant speculated that Enron might have some interests in that investment fund relating to some projects out West, but he wasn't sure.   In any event, depending on their desire to move forward with us, we will need to be ready to talk credit/contract with them on short notice. I'll keep you all updated on any feedback i get from the customer. Regards John

Genia Can you please forward this to all lawyers in the power trading group. Thanks 
Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one year.  Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to closing.  My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power contracts.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Please forward this memo on to the lawyers on your team. 
Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable Top Legal Risks 1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak. Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination damages, broad performance outs. 2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as to which entity is liable for which trades. 3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities. 4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing. 5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on a very tight time schedule. 6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on how to document transactions involving power. 7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure everybody understands risks associated with transactions. Documentation Projects 1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen reliance on WSPP. 2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual transactions that are not part of a master. 3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power product definitions. 4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all e-trading. 5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  - work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll 
Mark As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.  The Canadian Master is based upon EEI but has been ""retyped"" making changes based upon variations in the way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, differences in product and jurisdictional issues.  EEI has called me and stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the reasons he stated in his email to you.  Do you think I should set up a meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.  At that time, we could also discuss the significant ""policy differences"" to make sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons for the differences. Thanks Elizabeth 
Janette I'm not sure what you are looking for but here is brief description for power trading ENA's Legal Power Trading group supports all of Enron's U.S.-based, wholesale trading legal requirements.

I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.  While Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely will eventually make the EEI contract the ""default"" contract if there are no other arrangements in place.  I would fully support and provide any assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI. drusso@reliantenergy.com 10/30/2000 06:07 PM

Jim - Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  While I'm still checking,  I am not aware that there is a ""formal process"" for being a board member of a non-corporate entity like SPP. We would, however,  want to look at the equivalent of SPPs Bylaws to make sure that members are not going to be liable for actions taken and to see if SPP has something like D&O insurance, protecting the members.  We can talk to SPP and see what there is.  Let me know if you want us to request/review documents.  Thanks James D Steffes@ENRON 10/30/2000 08:13 AM 
Elizabeth -- Ron McNamara heads up Government Affairs activities for SPP.  He has been asked to be a member of the SPP Board.  This would be great for EPMI because we would have more ability to influence SPP and its actions regarding opening the market. What form of approval do we need to have internally (if any) before Ron can become a SPP Board Member?  Are there any internal restrictions on this type of activity? Not sure if there are any risks, but I want to make sure that Ron won't be harmed by pursuing this opportunity. Thanks, Jim Ron McNamara Sent by: Ron McNamara 10/27/2000 11:44 AM

Chris Was Ontario Power Generation the Canadian company you mentioned this morning that has alot of generation in Ontario and would likely be a major factor in determining the contract to be utilized in Canada?

I'm glad you cancelled.   I agree that the changes are much broader than we intended. More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to DC this weekend, and likely out next week.  A short interlude but that's all. On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).  Are you supporting the use of EEI in Canada.  I think I have our Canadian office convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to ""Canadianize"" it, thereby creating an EEI Canadian.  Any thoughts. PS I am going to WSPP meeting just for the day - Mike Small has mentioned 
Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations. This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those counterparties that we confirm.  Please let me know if you have any comments on this form or any concerns about implementing this process.  Thanks. Carol 
Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.  Concept is fine, but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of a draft confirm that we use with TVA. 
how about anytime between 2 and 3 Houston time.  If not, I could also do 
2 hours later my crown is on, my teeth are happy but for the #3 upper right molar, which the dentist says, unbeknown to me, is abscessed.  I now need a root canal.  Soon.   That will make 562,003 to 1.

Hi Charlotte Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the same onslaught. When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you. See ya 36349 
Hi 
See you at 1130 unless I hear otherwise. Thanks for getting it set up. 
is the tournament on Sat or Sun or both? round robin? thanks

Peter, just a follow-up to your email. 1.  I would agree that OPG is mistaken.  After the meeting, Chris and I and others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered power.  On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/ a product definition that works with the physical master.  I know Chris is already working on this.  From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not that different from NEPOOL.  In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that you could incorporate into the physical master. 2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing). This is what we did in UI.  This is what we do in the California pool.  This is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.  I think the EEI fm gets you to the same place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree that the language could be more direct.  With the California product (CAISO energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things we also have to fix.  We likely in the future will also modify fm for the NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in the US that this is a change for the near future.  In general, fm is unique to the product and I believe will change with each product.  When Chris and I were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the Ontario product would be just as you stated:  Fm is only possible if the pool fails.  Just FYI, the god awful ""Into""product in the US was created by Enron for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was unavailable. 
Harrison called this am at home.  He said that you'all had discussed plans for Sat.  Because it's his B-day he wants to go out  - He seemed to suggest that you were on board, so I said OK too.  Hope that's OK.  There may be a 
I think I could 3:30 (deal may be closing, but unlikely - if it did I might have to cancel - I would know by lunch). If you want, we could maybe try hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.  If this doesn't work, just 
Attached is the lastest redline and clean PPA.  This along with the GPSA will be provided to AA for their MTM review.  Hopefully this will result in a favorable review and we can move to close.  Michael, I will contact you regarding the timing of when we should hear back from AA. Thanks, - Mike 
Attached are the final PPA and GPSA documents.  No change was made to Section 5.02(g) due to Kevin Presto's discussion with Roger.  Looks like we are going to try and get this accepted by AA as is.  I did make change in Section 2.01(b) per Gail's suggestion. Please give me a call when you get a chance letting me our timeline from receiving word back from AA. Thanks again, - Mike 
Rodgers As we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter.  I drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in mind.  Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take and we can revise accordingly. Thanks 
yuk. so sorry to have to cancel that deal is making like it wants to close and the traders scheduled a 430 call to wrap it up don't they know we have better things to do here is to getting back on track after thanksgiving 
per my vm 
Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made in support of EPMI's obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement (""PPA"") and Green  Premium Sharing Agreement (""GSPA"").? The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our Cabazon Wind Power Project (the project most recently financed by EWC) and the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty.  As we discussed last week, since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants, we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by Enron and the banks.  We plan to use the same basic form for the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the seller's obligations under the PPA.  We will forward the draft of that guaranty to you later today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions concerning the attached guaranties.  Thank you. - PPA Guaranty.doc - GPSA Guaranty.doc - REDLINE GPSA Guaranty.doc - REDLINE PPA Guaranty.doc

Hi Mike I am definitely coming out for meeting on Monday - if you want to hit/play before meeting let me know and I'll bring my stuff. 
Hi Carol I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.

Good luck on your search. ps - Thanks for playing last week.  I look forward to playing again after 
Thanks for the documents.  If OK w you, I will look at during my flight on Sunday and will call you on Monday am  if I have any comments.  If this isn't OK, please leave me a voice mail and I will try to review earlier. Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349 PS - Chris, I agree with your  comment re the EEI copyright  and references - I'm not sure what the right answer is - do you want to continue calling it an""""EEI Canada""?  Is that OK with EEI? Do you think we should rename it in the name of the organization that ""approves"" it?  Is that OK w EEI?  Maybe you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with Andy from EEI to 
Jeff I enjoyed speaking with you on the flight back to Houston.  As promised, here is the information about the Ontario meeting regarding the creation of a Physical Power Master for Canada.  Don't hesitate to call if you have any thoughts or comments. Talk to you soon Elizabeth Sager 713 853 6349 
Here is my attempt to flesh out the Escrow Provision. Feel free to mark it up all you want,  If you can - mark it up by hand and  fax it to me before you go to Ella's school function. (My FAX NO. is  (503) 464-8058.)   I will then turn the document around in advance of our call with Gayle McKenzie at Morgan Lewis which is confirmed w/ her and has been set up for  2pm Houston time on Tuesday. If you need to reach me - please call Jan King on (503) 464-8814 or my direct number (503) 464-8782. Thanks so much for all your help, Shari 
Attached is draft escrow language for Black Hills that I made up in an attempt to be sympathetic to Black Hills's desire for certainty on the release of funds - please review and call Shari with comments first thing on Wed.  I will be travelling Wed but will check messages on Wed afternoon. 
At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input. 
To All: Bill McCoy has completed an initial draft of a credit annex for consideration by the drafting committee and interested working group participants.

Hi We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 1st.  That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.  SO I'm writing invitations now.  Here it is: Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo? Around 10:00?  We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer to  ..... shop. 
Thanks for your message Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator. Coaching seems to be his real passion. I'm sorry I  can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are scrambling to find a birthday concept. On a better note, I can play all this week. Any day, any time works for me - let me know when you can. 
Sorry for the delay but here it is  - A good landscape architect in the Heights is Pam August (husband name Todd) who lives on Cortdlandt (sorry no 
HI Just got this message - email at home couldn't open attachment.  Go ahead a send rest when you can, no problem.  Hey, will you send me your new address.

NYC Address: 156 First Avenue between 9th and 10th Street Buzzer # 21 Ground floor apartment on right back .. Good Breakfast place for Family is the KKK on first Avenue between 12th and 13th St... or is it 11th and 12th.. LOOK on right side as you go up the avenue.. cheap and good with garden in the back...... Directions to house from NYC: Take the West Side Highway in Manhattan to the G.W. bridge. Go to upper level of bridge and stay in right side lane. ..take first right hand exit after going over the bridge onto the Palisades ParkwayNorth. Stay on Palisades until you see exit (9??)for Route 287 North to Albany (to New York State Thruway) on right. Go North on thruway to Exit 19 Kingston. ( about an hour ). Once through the toll, stay on the right and merge onto the traffic circle taking first right exit to Route 28 Pine Hill. Take Route 28 all the way to Fleischmanns Exit (about 50 minutes ....You'll go past Olive , Boiceville , Shandanken, Phoenicia, Pine Hill). Take exit and round bend into town. Look for first and only gas station on right and take right turn just before it onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to Elk Creek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement on Left.. , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street ) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vly creek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left.. White with unstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are two driveways .. use the second for easy unloading through back. Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat (brunette sister) Dury. (914)254 4360.. Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan & Adele Seigel driveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the need.. I'm sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford.. Karen and Jim Rauter live on the high road.. (Lake Street extension) 254 4180.. they have a little boy Julian about Sam's age.. Again please feel free to call them.. She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit environmental group.. Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too.... Walk down his driveway until you get to trailer .... garden on right... veer off left past the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on right.. Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond .. His new house.. (I helped design) is on top of the hill....Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.just watch for fast traffic.. nice views.. walk through little abandoned cemetery across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for nice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to Johnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through other peoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon in the yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's .. until we go off the road..We also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it... Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . .. Go back to Route 28 and take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facility with life guards and the  ""beach "" looks a little fakey from the road but the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock.. There are some creek swimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if  you see a bunch of cars along the road chances are that's one.... In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public swimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts.. another good place to hang and play frisbee with the kids... Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas.. or hike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow that road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on right... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautiful vista and a not too strenuous hike.. You can find these places on the maps of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a cabinet in the Living Room .. This is our too busy to put away depository.. For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on the left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway.. it is the cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on a Sat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30 there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a wonderful old round barn.. See attached maps.... Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping.... wine store.. cheese store and an A&P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place on route 28 in Arkville.. He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster..... Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good browsing.. Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel with restaurant and is very pretty.. also has good thrift shop.. Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by relocated tasteful city folk.. good food!!! Things about the house.... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our pipes in the bathroom.. don't be alarmed.. just adjust the controls to help get rid of it..... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking or drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content- We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the basement.. The Spring is located on the ""high road"" going back towards Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is.. go over little bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 100 yards until you see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the left side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the road across from the pine stand.... It is delicious water... The house water is just fine for bathing and rinsing food... Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as the water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thing if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it.. If it gets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to the public showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could borrow hers...  We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him when we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in the creek while you wait..P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is on top of the Fridge.... Well I think that's the most of it.. I'll call you from Block Island with our number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 911...our fire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main Street in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergency room on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for some reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician... otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help .. she has an excellent rep. 
I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.  My mom wants us to stay at a hotel while in DC.  I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.  Bob is out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend to stay with Mom while Bob is out.  What do you think. PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi. Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.  What do you think. 
Mark , I assume that I should continue work on this. If its OK with you, I would like to schedule time with you and Mark T to think through how we should approach the creation/adoption of a single contract for physical/financial(maybe) trading. Thanks Elizabeth 36349 
I think it looks great - my only thought really is on the middle section relating to cleaning laying out the elements of negligence and a statement of the standard to be applied  - I quickly revised your section to give you an idea of what I was thinking.  In any event I think you are absolutely on the right track.  Good luck and let me know what else I can do. 
Chi is now confused.  She want to do the wedding but is feeling overwhelmed by all the issues: Mom Her sickness John Short notice for all involved creating tension She and Douglas feeling stressed as a result of above Mom She seeks advice from a sage Midwesterner. 
Sorry I didn't get too far but What I read I think is looking great - good luck 
Hi John Today has disappeared so I don't think we will be able to squeeze in a meeting.  The Black Hills deal is still stuck in credit land so I will call the Denver office if need be.  Thanks again and I look forward to speaking 
Hi Charlotte I'd love to play but I can't this week. Yuck. Let's try next week. PS Doubles was fun - I haven't played much doubles and it really is a different rhythm. Maybe we could play doubles sometime soon too

Janice Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll. 
Attached is a draft of a PPA/Tolling Agreement that we were negotiating last year in connection with the potential disposition of our 99 Peaking Assets. I believe you have seen this one before (in fact, I my memory serves my correctly you provided significant input).  I hope this is helpful. Stuart 
Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.  Concept is fine, but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of a draft confirm that we use with TVA.

From Rick Antonoff: Following our telephone conversations on Sunday and Tuesday, please find attached our revised preliminary draft memorandum addressing the bankruptcy issues that we have been discussing, and incorporating the additional facts raised during our telephone conferences this week.  Based on our discussions and the revisions made to the draft Settlement Agreement this week, our draft memorandum is now based upon the Avista transaction. Attached are clean and redline versions of the revised draft.  The redline is marked to show changes from the draft we circulated on December 22, 2000. We look forward to receiving your thoughts and comments after you have an opportunity to review the memorandum. Regards.

CY please work through w Tim thanks 
In the interest of time, I am forwarding the attached contract to Kevin Hughes, Wanda Curry, Don Black, Ron Adzegary, and Marty Sunde.  Please read the attached and confirm that this is your understanding of the  PGET/EPMI/ EEMC assignment. I am also at this time forwarding to the working group my four main points, which I think reflect my main areas of concern under the drafts: 1.  I would like to say  that  the price is the same under the transactions. Transaction costs should be dealt with separately. 2. While we have agreed to take a pass through of the bankruptcy risk,  this draft provides that we take on all contract dispute risk.  As I understand it, EPMI intends to pass through all risk, such as change in delivery point risk, under the contract.  Since EPMI is our sole provider of power to EES (other than  the PGET contract), EPMI is in the best position to manage general contract risk with its counterparties, as it does today with all our physical electricity purchases.  EPMI may  have disputes under contracts for many reasons that EEMC is not aware of and will not be in a position to influence once the contracts are  assigned to Avista. 3. I assume if EPMI  trades out of  these positions as it manages its own portfolio, the credit risk would not follow to subsequent counterparties and the EPMI/EES confirm terms would revert to typical confirm language. 4.  I was operating under the assumption that the tax issue would be resolved with Steve Douglass prior to signing the main documents.  I am not sure whether this issue can be quantified by EES tax today.  Any suggestions or ability to resolve/quantify today?  Same concern for the accounting issues. My concern here is that if the transaction leaves us in a worse economic position as a result of making EPMI whole, this would need to be addressed with our business people. Elizabeth and JOhn, what are the next steps. ""JOHN G KLAUBERG"" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM> on 12/28/2000 12:08:34 PM

Confidential - Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable A. PGE I. Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the underlying contracts"": 1.  PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA  - Enron exposure $23 million 2.  PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure $215 million 3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million 4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a threshold (either $100 million or $50 million): 1. PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA - Enron Exposure $23 million 2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million) 3.PGET Power/ENA - Physical Coal - Enron exposure $200,000 4.PGET Power/ENA - Financial GTC - Enron exposure ($6.2 million) 5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money, currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215 million - see contract 2 above) 6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million 7.  PGE Canada/ENA -Physical Gas- Enron exposure $1 million 8. PGET Gas/Enron Canada - Enron Exposure ($2.3 million) 9.PGET Gas/ENA -Financial ISDA - Enron exposure $ 48 million 10. PGET Gas/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($25 million) 11. PGET Gas/EES - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($700,000) Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent (PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000.  We have not yet made demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due. Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.  Before terminating, we would need to verify actual contract language. B.  SCE Default SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to  a power sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million. Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then terminate and accelerate amounts due.  Amounts payable could offset amounts owed by SCE to EPMI or its Affiliates including Enron Wind or Portland General.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT DO NOT DISTRIBUTE Elizabeth: I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I thought I could generally review the PPA in any event. In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D. As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position. Preliminary Overall Assessment The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue. While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for ""Year 1"" only would apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for ""Year 35"" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract Term.  The anomaly ""running in the other direction"" is that, under CMS's interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis (e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would

EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a MDE ""the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate"". What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap. I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are ""artificially"" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue. 
You are correct on the facts PGET pays a higher price to Morgan than EES pays

Further to my voicemail -- this is the deal to cover Laura Podurgiel's short for cal 01. Regards, Janice EB3861 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-4842) 
Janice, Another high priority deal.  The attached proposal is for Western Resources in order to cover a short position we have in SPP.  Noone will sell us FLD so we are agreeing to a system firm deal with one catch.  Western Resources will put in reserve 20-25% of the total deal value in an account.  They will then reimburse us  up to the amount in reserve, if they cut us.  I have tried to lay out as muck detail in the attachment as possible.  This deal would need to be closed by Jan 1.  Let me know if we need to meet on this and I will get someone from the desk to come along.  I will call you to follow up on this. Thanks. -Joe

This chart shows Morgan as CP - we are also doing similar deal with Avista. 
Calling brokers to find out what prices would have been is an impossible task.  I agree with your assessment.  Unfortunately, caps are not disruptions but have become a normal course of business. 
EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a MDE ""the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate"". What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap. I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are ""artificially"" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue. Thanks for your thoughts.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Elizabeth: Attached is draft of the termination payment letter with a few suggested changes, but nothing major.  I tried to include a blackline, but it seemed to get corrupted so I don't know if it will be of much use to you. A few notes: (1)  I did not have the various contracts with me when I reviewed this, but I have asked Jim if he could make sure I did not make any inaccurate statements as well as input the few contract section references that are open and the information on the Canadian termination.  (However, I was not sure whether you wanted Peter Keohane to input the relevant information on the Canadian side.). (2)  In light of PG&E's letter to us, I thought we may want to make some short statements about the affiliate set off rights under the Bankruptcy Code in the termination letter. (3)  I modified some of the language on the CalPX liabilities.  I didn't have my exposure sheet with me, but I thought I recall that we were both owed money from the CalPX  and that we had some risk on the chargeback liability depending on how FERC ultimately comes out on the issue.  As you know, the FERC decision about 3 weeks ago prohibited the CalPX from proceeding with the chargeback ""under these circumstances"" or some type of language like this, but it seemed to have punted the final resolution of the issue until at least the commandeered contract valuation issue had been resolved--thus, although perhaps not likely, it seemed to me at the time that FERC gave itself an opening to reconsider the chargeback issue after the valuation determination had been made. (4)  While I bracketed the language, I thought we may want to affirmatively and briefly set forth the business reason why EPMI is holding the direct access claim to at least give them something to think about.  As we have discussed, PG&E's likely reaction will be that we are using unsupportable self help to not pay them anything on the termination of the 3 power confirmations by claiming a set off for the negative CTCs.  To the extent we can articulate a short business rationale for EPMI having that claim, it may at least make them pause as to whether our business rationale arguably could prevail. (5)  We note in the letter certain claims we have against PG&E that we are not setting off--e.g., the ISDA termination payment.  We also reference the

Dear Elizabeth, Please find attached the draft form termination letter, coupled with a Notice of Settlement Amount, that you requested.  Please note that we recommend that these form letters be used merely as guides as the contracts that Enron has entered into with the PG&E entities all provide for varying procedures for termination.  Therefore, each contract should be referenced prior to sending out a termination letter. Additionally, Jim Huemoeller and I believe that it would be best that one person be responsible for preparing the various terminations, or in the alternative, have such person review each termination letter so that there is consistent wording and so that the Enron and LeBoeuf persons responsible for monitoring the PG&E situation are certain which contracts are being terminated. Please let us know if you have any questions, or if we can be of further assistance. Best regards, Christina L.C. McDonald

Any thoughts? 
The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving PG&E's recent reorganization.  Obviously by this reorganization, PG&E is attempting to shield its assets in the event of a bankruptcy.  I'm wondering if we should become active in this case, to protect our interests in the event of a bankruptcy. 
John, thanks for the update. I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of you if he needs to. Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to ""Regional Management"" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and Trading. Thanks and good luck! 
All: As some of you may be aware, we are in the process of negotiating with Central Maine Power Company regarding the assumption of a portion of their wholesale obligations associated with their Standard Offer Service load in the State of Maine, covering at least March 1, 2001 - Feb 28, 2002.   We are currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms. They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for about 2-3 hours). Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows: Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood Legal:  Janice Moore Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223, 3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to date.  Thanks.

I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 60-day notice period. I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter. Steve

Dave and Ed, We closed two option deals with TVA last week.  They have sent the following comments on our standard confirms. Dave - Rogers has already commented on the 16 hour call.  His comment was that this is a 16 hour call, all or none, not up to 16 hours.  Secondly, the option is exercisable in 50 MW blocks (increments of 50MW) not a minimum of 50 MW.  Please look at the rest of the language and let me know your thoughts.  Thanks. Ed-  there are some credit additions on page 3 under credit assurance.  Let me know what you think. Thanks guys. -Joe 
David, TVA's proposed credit assurance language should be amended to reflect our standard language with the downgrade event being established at BBB- or Baa3.  Also, your redline should also delete any subjectivity which provides the TVA the unilateral right to call for additional or replacement collateral.  In looking at historical agreements (i.e. master options agreement), our standard credit provisions have been accepted.  I will forward another email with their prefered gty form.  It appears that we currently have outgoing gtys; however, they govern certain agreements like the Master Options Agmt.  Comments or questions, please call. Ed Sacks

Hi John Thanks for the  offer but despite what you say, your legal prowess is still far more important to me - I would likely have ceased working long ago w/out LLGM.  I rode up on the elevator with Jeff Skilling and he asked me if I still liked my job.  I first asked if I had a choice and then confessed it could be better.  I don't think I won many points with him, particularly when I asked him if he liked his job.  Oh well, any connections there? I'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you and Jim.  I can talk to you and Jim about that as well as offset with the commandeered positions anytime on Wed morning.  Let me know what time works

The discussion regarding the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 with Ken Raisler of Sullivan and Cromwell has been scheduled for 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. in Sandalwood Rooms A & B of the downtown Hyatt Regency Hotel (sorry, we will not be serving lunch). Attorneys and legal specialists in the swaps/Enron Net Works group are strongly encouraged to attend. Each of the attorneys should have already received a package that includes the complete text of the CFMA, as well as the text of the Commodity Exchange Act, black-lined to show how it has been revised by the CFMA.

There is an internal political risk that if we send out this letter the way it is written, Legal will be blamed for terminating a lucrative trading relationship.  I would like to manage this risk by putting back into the letter a bunch of self serving nonesense that will make it easier for the CRC guy to show the letter to his boss, while still getting our bottom line legal point across.

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION NOT DISCOVERABLE Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.  PCA claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.  This amount appears to be based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, and certain ""preference payments"" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.  This claim is in its preliminary stages.  I will update you with further information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really seeking.  As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable amount. Bill In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have someone gather the following information: 1.  Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we received from PCA would have been around May 20th). 2.  Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for. 3.  The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939)

** PRIVATE ** Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night.  Overall, I felt we made a lot of progress.  At the end of the call, Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points.  We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then ""compare notes.""  He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly. Material Regulatory Change Provision.  Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability to pay for power.  (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change).  Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a ""default"" (which should not be a problem from our standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.  (For example, a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC).  Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.  However, he did say that CDWR might entertain a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it.  My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs. Early Walk Provision.  He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option. With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) (our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date. Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 days.  He said all other suppliers have lived with that.  Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the ""bond guys"" are already nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs). Suspension of Delivery.  Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other events, such as a bond downgrade.  Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that. Downgrade not a Default.  CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default.  However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.  In other words, a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.  Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued.  That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without LDs. Cross Defaults.  This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not be able to get this is my sense.  However, when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR. LD Calculation Methodology.  Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language.  He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more ""objective.""  My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general. Arbitration.  In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).  Also, holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral.  I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise.  My general sense, however, is that this is not a ""deal breaker"" for CDWR. Assignment.  In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking  for some consistency.  We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our reaction would be.  Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we said we would look at.  We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment.  He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals. New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.  A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad. Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.  He di agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it was fair for us to be protected from that. Legal Opinions.  Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds.  Also, he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins. Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires. Additional CDWR Covenants.  Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed internally with CDWR. Pro Rata ""Spread"" Amortization.  Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would run it by CDWR. CDWR Information.  Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information.  He was resisting our request for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things start to fall into place.

All: Here is a rough first cut at a DASH for a potential deal with NSTAR to serve their Default Service.  Jim/Zach - please fill in all relevant numbers relating to volume/pricing, etc.   Also - please begin to get RAC in the loop with respect to this position and VaR impacts, etc.  Others - please review pertinent sections and edit/expand as appropriate. Timing on this will likely be quick from this point and thus I would like to try to have a completed draft by COB today or first thing tomorrow.  We have a call with NSTAR tomorrow AM to negotiate the contract, and assuming all goes well there, we could be asked to sign a binding agreement by as early as Wednesday.

Another QSE Agreement that is not as high a priority as TECO but needs to get to the New Power Company as soon as possible in order to get them into the Pilot Program. Thanks for your assistance with this while David is out. - Mike 
I haven't stopped crying since I got your email .. Of course I've been crying everyday, several hours a day for months now, so it is hard to tell whose to blame ....

Peter Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know. Hope all is well. 
Ship it up.If you want it we could look up blue book value and then figure out an appropriate valuation.  If you don't want it, you are Chi could sell it in DC or you could use it for a trade in.  If shipping is expensive and 
Wes Here is current draft of CDWR agreement.  Negotiations are still underway. The underlying contract is the EEI Master - let me know if you need that standard form. Call w/ any questions/comments Elizabeth 36349 
John:  as per your request, attached are revised drafts of the Confirmation and Cover Sheet, which are blacklined against the respective documents from the short-term deal.  I recognize that you are still reviewing certain questions/points with CDWR and there may be some items reflected in this draft that neither you nor CDWR has ""signed off"" on.  Nonetheless, in certain cases I thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may be proposing on a particular item. Please note, in particular, the following: --on the LD calculation, we reverted to your proposed language on obtaining multiple market quotes, etc.  However, after talking to Enron this evening, we would like to propose that if quotes cannot be obtained despite the parties' good faith efforts to do so, then only in that circumstance would the calculation be based on the Non-Defaulting Party's losses.  While, based on the product Enron is selling, we anticipate that quotes will be readily obtainable, we think it makes sense to revert to the Non-Defaulting Party's loss calculation in the highly unlikely event that quotes are not obtainable despite using all efforts to do so.  I know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject to some manipulation.  This is not so.  If CDWR was the Defaulting Party and it disputes the loss calculation made by Enron, such dispute would become the subject of arbitration.  In such case, the Non-Defaulting Party's would have to furnish its historical and current power curves to prove its case.  Since those same figures necessarily are needed by Enron to report its trading positions on a day to day basis as part of its normal business operations and such information feeds directly into its financial reporting statements and other relevant financial information, etc. that becomes, in part, part of its SEC filings, in a discovery proceeding this information would be very transparent. --with respect to the situs of any arbitration proceeding, Enron strongly believes that it is only fair to both parties that this be conducted in a neutral site.  The draft provides for New York City, although Enron is open to other possible locations. --the revised draft reflects only the $127/MWh alternative scenario since you indicated that, preliminarily, you felt that CDWR would not be likely to choose the alternative structure we had discussed. --we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal regulatory change.  I'm sure you can appreciate this in light of the current environment, although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed. Enron is not seeking a termination right with LDs, but would like to further discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major adverse federal development affecting the contract. --we have dropped our request that Enron have the right to suspend performance in the case of a Bond downgrade event.  However, we think it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs, that the due date for payments by CDWR should shorten to 7 days and if the Bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment schedule would revert accordingly. --you requested that we propose a limit on the right of a Non-Defaulting Party to suspend its performance in the case of a Default by the Defaulting Party.  We included a 60-NERC day limit on such right in the revised draft. This is important to Enron as we discussed, particularly in light of Enron's acceptance of the 180 day period on the timing of a Termination Payment which, as you know, is unheard of in the power sale (or virtually any other) arena.  (Nonetheless, we fully understand the position enunciated by the bond people on this point). --on assignment, the Enron commercial people cannot agree to a pre-approved right of CDWR to assign the contract to the IOUs.  As we discussed, it may very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected that Enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties.  It can't be in a position where such an assignment could cause it to violate those limits. --we included an outside date by which Enron must decide whether or not to go forward of the first to occur of (1) September 30, 2001 or (2) seven days after the Bonds are issued.  You had indicated that CDWR might be willing to consider such an ""outside date"" as long as (i) the $127/MWh pricing was in effect from April 1 and (2) Enron had to act very shortly after the Bonds are issued.  We have proposed 7 days for this. --in concept, we probably will be ok with the alternative of securing a credit rating for the Fund (as opposed to the Bonds), although we have referred that question to the credit people to make sure. --in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside counsel, we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be from the AG, or if CDWR cannot do that, then from the GC of CDWR.  We felt that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be rendered in connection with the Bonds and we provided that they generally would be provided to us after the Bonds are issued. I think the foregoing represent most of the items we had discussed.  Please let me know when you wish to discuss.  Also, it may make sense for our next call to have the respective Enron and CDWR commercial folks on the call since it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be commercial ones. Lastly, please note that while we have discussed most of the points addressed in the revised drafts with Enron, in order to expedite the process, we are sending these drafts simultaneously to you and Enron.  Thus, it is possible that Enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents. Thanks.  We look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite documents.

The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI Contract Standization Mailing List. To All: We will hold a meeting of the contract working group at EEI's offices on October 9, 2000 from 10am to 4pm.  Lunch will be provided.  We tried to schedule a meeting around Power Markets 2001, but EEI does not have space available for a large group that week.  A detailed agenda will be sent out before the meeting. If anyone still wants to advise the drafting committee about issues they want to address, please do so.  It would be helpful for the drafting committee to see what customized terms are being added to your cover sheets.  Please forward them to me if you want to help us.

Elisabeth: I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

John:  Following up on your voice mail, attached are revised drafts of the Confirm and the Master Agreement.  Please note that, as you may recall, Elizabeth Sager is out of town today and I have not been able to catch up with her to get her views on the things set forth in your e-mail to me, or with Christian.  However, we had a brief conversation after our call yesterday about some of the points on your ""list"" and I have tried to generally work with what you have proposed on a few of the points in light of my conversations with Elizabeth and Christian.  Since I have to leave the office within an hour or so today, I thought I would forward some proposed language on some of the points for your consideration with the hope of expediting the process.  These drafts, therefore, are subject to Enron's review and comment. Please call me if you wish to discuss.

Here is a brief memo prepared by Dan Watkiss relating to the relationship between TVA transmission and marketing.  N I will call you later to discuss TVA letter. Kevin does not want to make offer to sell at market based rates.  Also want to discuss if there is any way we can challenge TVA on the hourly tag problems of last week. Talk to you soon. Thanks 
ES--Bob Madden may be interested in this.  If TVA is not formally separated, then TVA control area saying it will not retag when EPMI changes the source (from ENSE to AEP, for example) and TVA marketing not taking us as an upstream if we do that are really interconnected.  Maybe Bob can come up with something. Bill--Does TVA ever buy transmission on any other TP's system?  It must not or it would have to file it Practices as a OATT with FERC.  Does TVA just buy or sell at its border?  Thanks.

Hi Carol! Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime (hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write. See you soon Elizabeth

Here are proposed responses to these discovery requests: Request for Admission - Admit that CPSC agreed to go forward with the transaction proposed in the July 30, 1999 letter absent a guarantee from CPSC's parent company. Answer:  EPMI objects to this request in that it is vague and ambiguous, particularly in its use of the term ""agreed to go forward.""  Subject to and without waiving this objection, EPMI denies this request. Interrogatory - If your answer to the preceding request for Admission is other than an unqualified admission, state in detail the basis for your denial or qualification of the admission. Answer:  EPMI objects to this interrogatory for the reasons stated in its response to the preceding request for admission.  Subject to and without waiving this objection, EPMI states that CPSC made no apparent effort to seek LCRA's consent to an assignment as contemplated by the July 30, 1999.  In telephone conversations in the late afternoon of the last day for the parties to have entered into such an assignment pursuant to the terms of the July 30, 1999 letter agreement (which conversations were initiated by EPMI several days earlier) CPSC indicated that it would begin to negotiate an assignment without a parent guarantee, but CPSC did not, in fact, agree to an assignment before the expiration of the time period contemplated by the July 30, 1999 letter agreement.  After that time had expired, CPSC did not continue negotiations with EPMI. Let me know what you think. Bonnie J.

Hi Harlan Hope your enjoying your fortuitous timing - since you've been gone we haven't seen below triple digits and there is no relief in site.  In that vain, I'd love nothing more than to pull you back for nothing less than an Into meeting.

He would propose that he, Rogers Herndon and John Zufferli attend.  Let me know what days would work for you. Happy trails Elizabeth

Our goal is to execute tomorrow. Thanks, Terri

Monday April 9, 2:52 pm Eastern Time Calpine says PG&E in breach of power contracts (UPDATE: updates with company comments to analysts) SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9 (Reuters) - Independent power company Calpine Corp. (NYSE:CPN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cpn&d=t> - news </n/c/cpn.html>) said on Monday that bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and Electric was in breach of contract after failing to make some $267 million in payments and it would seek prompt court action to secure payment or be freed from its energy contracts. ADVERTISEMENT <http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6 31358/R=0/*http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html > <http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6 31358/R=0/*http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html > ``Right now there is breach of contract'' for power Calpine has provided Pacific Gas and Electric, Calpine senior vice president Lisa Bodensteiner told an analysts teleconference. ``We are filing motions this week with the bankruptcy court to direct PG&E to pay us. If it doesn't decide this, we will then ask the court to relieve of us of our contacts and let us sell to the open market,'' she said. San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine said in a statement earlier Monday it was confident PG&E would be able to pay Calpine's 11 qualifying facility subsidiaries (QFs) for past-due power sales. Calpine's 11 QF plants, which generate around 600 megawatts of power from small natural gas-fired and geothermal plants, are part of a fleet of qualifying facilities that can produce up to about a third of all the power generated in California. As of March 31, Pacific Gas and Electric owed a total of $643 million for power the QFs have supplied to its customers, according to the California Public Utilities. PG&E must assume Calpine's contracts in its bankruptcy proceedings for them to continue, Calpine said. PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news </n/p/pcg.html>) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest inverstor-owned utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday after piling up around $9 billion in wholesale power costs it has not been able to recover due to California's 1996 deregulation legislation. Calpine senior vice president Jim Macias told analysts that if PG&E ``were dumb enough'' not to affirm the contracts, Calpine could make an extra $380 million selling the energy tied up in its QF contracts with PG&E on the open spot market. ``We are in constant discussions with state municipal utilities and the state to sell our power. We are very confident we will be able to move this energy should the contacts be rejected,'' Macias said. He estimated spot electricity prices in the state are currently about $260 per megawatt hour. A Calpine spokeswoman said Monday the company's QF facilities operated when California declared power emergencies, but could not comment on whether they operate when an alert is not called. In addition to the $267 million currently owed, San Francisco-based Calpine also holds a long-term $68 million note receivable with PG&E for energy deliveries from 2003 to 2014, but that the note is note yet due. Calpine, which said it did not expect the $267 million PG&E owes it to grow, said the utility had paid 15 percent of what PG&E owes it for energy delivered in December and January, but had not paid anything since. Calpine, which has its own natural gas storage reserves in Sacramento, Calif., also said it expected to make payments to its gas suppliers.
