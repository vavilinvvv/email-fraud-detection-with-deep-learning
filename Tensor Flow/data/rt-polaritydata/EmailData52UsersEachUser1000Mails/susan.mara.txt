BOTTOMLINES: PG&E has asked the CPUC to approve participation of E-19 and E-20 Direct Access customers in the ISO A/S load participation pilot program (filed June 7). SCE has asked the CPUC to approve that all customers on its Large Power Interruptible tariff can participate in the ISO A/S load participation pilot program (filed June 7). FERC approved the ISO's Load Participation pilot progam and pricing on June 14, 2000, calling it an innovative program.

PG&E didn't have much to offer on the ""double-billing"" issue -- it said either PG&E could change the customers bill or the ISO could adjust its payment. FERC threw out all the protests by various parties (e.g., MWD, M-S-R, other munis) and approved the ISO's proposal.  The big issues were:  supposed improper allocation of demand relief program costs (ISO allocates it to all SCs based on metered demand during all hours of the program);q request to charge those who are out of balance for most of the costs; the need to file pro forma agreement in advance (FERC said ISO doesn't have to); and the supposed overly restrictive program participation.

The ISO Board just voted to make no change to the level of the price cap currently in effect ($250).  Also, the Board voted to extend its price cap 
All, Here's a summary of the actions taken at this morning's CPUC meeting. SDG&E Rate Stabilization Plan CPUC voted 5-0 to approve the Rate Ceiling Plan that implements AB 265 signed yesterday by Governor Davis.  The Plan basically tracks the language of AB 265 by establishing a ceiling of 6.5 cents per kWh per month on the electricity rate component of bills for residential, small commercial and lighting customers.  The class of small commercial customers, as defined in AB 265, also include all SDG&E customers on Rate Schedule A, general acute care hospitals, K-12 public and private schools, and all SDG&E customers on Schedule AL-TOU under 100 kW.  The Plan is retroactive to June 1, 2000, extends through December 31, 2002 and is effective immediately though it can be extended for another year if the public interest calls for an extension.  SDG&E is required to record any revenue shortfalls to a balancing account within the TCBA with any net revenues generated from SDG&E-owned or managed generation assets to be used to offset any undercollections that result. In addition, AB 265 charged the CPUC with setting up a voluntary program for large commercial, agricultural and industrial customers who procure energy from SDG&E so that these customers may elect to cap the electricity rate component at the 6.5 cents ceiling, with a true-up after a year.  The CPUC is giving parties 15 days from today's decision to file comments on this provision with reply comments due 15 days after the comments are due. Moreover, the CPUC also ordered that the investigation into the electric market opened by the August 3 OII be broadened specifically to address the issues raised in Assembly Joint Resolution (AJR) 77.  AJR 77 emphasized the need to review ""the options for correcting the electricity market, methods to eliminate price volatility for consumers and methods of cost

mmittee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: Attached please find a letter from the California State Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market indicating the confidential treatment it will afford confidential information submitted by the CA ISO to the Committee in response to the subpoena circulated to Market Participants on April 30 (attached).  The letter provides that the deadline for a response by the CA ISO is extended to Friday, May 18 at 9:00 AM.  This message is to inform Market Participants that the CA ISO will comply with the subpoena in a timely manner unless it gets a valid court order to the contrary by close of business (5:00 PM) Thursday, May 17.  The CA ISO will seek confidential treatment under the letter for information subject to 20.3 of the CA ISO tariff and other confidential material. Any concerns relating to the subpoena should be communicated to Jeanne Sole at 916-608-7144 and jsole@caiso.com <mailto:jsole@caiso.com>  and copied to Charlie Robinson at crobinson@caiso.com <mailto:crobinson@caiso.com>  and Norma Formanek at nformanek@fbm.com <mailto:nformanek@fbm.com> .

Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: The CA ISO has received a number of calls from Market Participants asking to review the confidential attachments to the CA ISO/EOB's March 1 motion requested recently from FERC pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (request attached).  Market Participants argue that they require access to the attachments in order to respond to the FOIA request.  The March 1 motion requested confidential treatment for the attachments ""although the ISO and the EOB do not believe that confidential treatment is required under the ISO Tariff"" because they were nonetheless ""concerned that release of the information contained in the appendices at this time could adversely affect the ngotiations currently underway between the State of California and the generators"".  Since these concerns exist, the CA ISO cannot release the confidential appendices.  Attached however are the cover sheets to each table which describe in detail what is contained in each table.  This information should assist Market Participants interested in the matter to prepare any response they may wish to submit to FERC.  Again, Market Participants should not rely on the CA ISO to make their arguments for them. Jeanne M.

Gary's letter responding to a series on ""poor Edison"" in the LA Times.  I reviewed it in advance -- looked good to me. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854 
To the Editor; The series of articles published last week by Ms. Cleeland called ""Edison's Agony"" continues your unbroken string of balanced and informative reporting on the California energy crisis.  My group of merchant generators and power marketers include many pre-competition Edison empoyees, and employees from other utilities as well.  We are sympathetic to the situation of those who currently serve under the Edison banner. We note, however, that something is amiss in your series, and only lightly touched.  That is, the role of SCE in advancing the legislation and policies in favor of competition in Californa. It was SCE, and its CEO Mr. Bryson who masterminded the state deregulation legislation.  Although SCE's Mr. Bryson  objected vigorously to forced sales of power plants, and asked for long terms power purchase contracts, those lost battles gave way to winning the stranded-cost-recovery war. SCE did well in adopting to the new reality, until the wholesale rates flew up, and left the utility unable to recover its costs.  SCE made a deliberate calculation in May of 2000 to leave its customers unprotected from cost shocks.  There was no hedging undertaken for future power purchases when the wholesale forward prices exceeded SCE's historical generation component of rates.  As a result, the debts piled up. Empathize with career employees of SCE, and with dedicated, hard working linemen who are always ready to serve at the cost of their private pleasures. But please, get it right.  Much of this misery was the avoidable direct consequence of actions taken by, not avoided, by the SCE management team. Gary B. Ackerman Executive Director Western Power Trading Forum 6155 Almaden Expy, Suite 230 San Jose, CA 95120 
OK.  I'll take a shot in answering your questions, Steve. Others are free to comment as well. The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened.  If you talk to the traders, they LOVE it.  Before April1, 1998, they had no sales to CA.  Now, they have millions of dollars of sales.  Why?  -- no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over. We still have some problems, however.  The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them.  We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them.  We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path 15 probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it. The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path 15. So, what are the access issues? Path 15 is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA.  Has been for years. The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla. When I left PG&E in 1996, the estimated coast was $300 million.  The congestion costs did not justify building the line then. PG&E continues to control Path 15 and tells the ISO what's left after PG&E allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes. There is no transparency.  PG&E has the ability to use Path 15 to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts.  Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesn't think PG&E is, but;... The ISO says it can't interpret PG&E's contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how it's some kind of overseer -- we protested and have now appealed.  The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One -- their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights -- more like interruptible -- but once the ISO started, all of a sudden, the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights (as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff). That's why we have pushed the issue.  Also, Dynegy and Power Exchange (not the PX) have rights on Path 15.  Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated. Information in general is pretty sketchy on real-time transmission.  We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows what's going on in transmission (as do the utilities), changes what it does, which then changes prices, and then doesn't tell us until after the fact.  The ISO has promised to do better, but I don't think has implemented any real changes yet. Advantageous access. Except for what's going on in Path 15, I don't think the IOUs have any advantages on access -- except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro -- but I think it's resource specific, rather than owner specific. The munis are another story.  See next item. Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country.  In making a devil's bargain with the munis, the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation.  The ""sanctity of contracts"" under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents (not the IOUs -- but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs) and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market.  The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munis/Dynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do (e.g., some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins, some get to do it every half hour, so far most haven't had to pay for ancillary services, etc.) There are many, many examples of how we are discriminated against (in addition to Path 15) and of how FERC has shined us on -- but yet we fight on. 
When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.  We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control ""path 15""?  Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there other examples and are there links between these ""preferences"" and the current problems in California?  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us. 
Steve, thought you should see this for Monday.

FERC issued three CA orders today.  Ray Alvarez sent out a summary on the order related to increasing Generation and Transmission in the west. The report below came from IEP's attorney. Underscheduling -- Enron has been on both sides on this issue -- here's what's happened One CA order rejects the requests by PG&E, SoCal Edison and the CAISO to suspend the underscheduling penalty adopted in the December 15th Order.  The Commission is currently reviewing data filed by the CAISO in conjunction with a request to waive the underscheduling and will address the underscheduling penalty in a future order.  The Order does accept the CAISO's proposal to split the BEEP stack into Operating Reserves and Imbalance Energy. QFs -- Ridgewood Complaint The second order address QF issues.  Granting, in part, Ridgewood and CCC's request for emergency relief, the Commission ruled that when QFs sell excess power or make third party sales as authorized by a court, the California utilities must provide interconnection and transmission service to make those sales.  The Commission deferred decision on whether QFs that have not been fully paid can make third party bilateral sales. Obstacles -- Subject of Ray's earlier e-mail The third order addresses obstacles to increased energy supply.  The Commission takes a number of actions, including allowing premium returns on equity (200 basis points) and accelerated depreciation (10 years) for projects that increase transmission capacity in the short term (July 1, 2001).  The basis points go down if the project comes on later.  The order also allows rolled-in treatment of interconnection and upgrade costs for new supply, broadens and extends QF waivers of operating and efficiency standards, waives prior notice requirements and grants market-based rate authority for sales from back-up and self-generation in WSCC, authorizes certain demand side sales and management programs, and encourages pipeline construction projects.

The feeling on the street is that Reliant was setup with the $1900 sale.  The word is that the bid for $1900 power had been sitting there for months and that Reliant had an ""understanding"" with DWR and the ISO that the bid was not supposed to be taken except in dire need -- it's for a peaker and the price represents the opportunity cost of running it now, and using up its very limited emission credits, rather than running it during the real peak times this summer. The $1900 represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have had its peaker available.  The wors is that the state/ISO took the bid, when there was not dire need, just to make Reliant look evil and point to ever higher prices -- when? -- yes, the week before the Bush plan was to come out.

May 17, 7:52 pm Eastern Time Press Release Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for Solutions HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2001--Reliant Energy strongly disagrees with California Governor Gray Davis' recent characterization of the company as being ``obstructionist'' and opposing court orders. Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing the state's energy crisis. The accusations are simply not based on fact. More importantly, the governor's attacks have done nothing to increase the state's supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer. If anything, the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty that have further destabilized the market. ``Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations and focus on true solutions to California's energy shortage,'' said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chief operating officer, Reliant Energy Wholesale Group. ``We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market, not government control of power generation, and we have offered solutions that do not jibe with the governor's political agenda. Contrary to the perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote, we have been focused on providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the outset of this crisis. In fact, earlier this week we provided the governor's office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that, if pursued quickly, could help mitigate the power crisis this summer. We are still waiting on a response.'' Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the lights on in California, disputing the accusation of being ``obstructionist'': Reliant Energy has run its 30-to-50-year-old plants at the highest levels since their purchase in 1998. In 2000, Reliant nearly doubled the output from these plants to meet the needs of Californians -- running them at levels far exceeding the prior owner, Southern California Edison. Reliant Energy invested $80 million dollars in 2000 alone to upgrade plants to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times. In addition, the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum. For the last two years, Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities and the state to invest in long-term contracts to stabilize rates instead of relying on the spot market. In particular, Reliant Energy offered to sell power at two cents per kilowatt-hour if the buyer would purchase the natural gas required to generate the power, ensuring a transparent cost of power. Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns that continue to exist over credit issues. In contrast, just last week a major out-of-state supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless payment was forthcoming. Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage businesses to ``sell back'' power voluntarily to add more power to the Western power grid. The company has met with many leaders in Western states to introduce the program, yet California officials will not even engage in a dialogue on the program. ``We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one with the governor,'' Perkins said. ``Unfortunately, he has repeatedly refused this request over the past year. Last week's meeting with generators was the first time the group was allowed to speak with him directly, and obviously the purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding.'' Perkins added that the governor's accusations of opposing court orders are unfounded. ``We have always worked within the law and are proud of our commitment to keeping the lights on. We have followed all court orders and worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all investigations. When necessary, we have filed court challenges to orders that we believe violate our rights -- hardly an illegal action.''

Tuesday, May 22, 2001 Legislators Set to Sue Federal Energy Agency Power: Lawmakers try a new idea: a lawsuit arguing that blackouts pose danger to people, law enforcement and even water supply. By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO--Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fight crime, and the state's drinking water supplies. Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes a new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer. A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), and the city of Oakland. ""A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California,"" the draft says. ""The public health, safety and welfare of the state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of 
Jim, IEP is seeking $15,000 more per company to be involved in its FERC/ISO Committee (and have a say over what IEP does).  I try to get IEP to make filings instead of Enron or to get them to bolster our posiiton.  I also use WPTF this way and I use WPTF much more than I use IEP, which is pretty well dominated by QFs and generators. I asked Dave Parquet if he would pay for part of it.

Allan Zaremberg, President of the California Chamber of Commerce, met with John Burton to discuss energy.  One of the items which John Burton brought up to Allan was Bob Hertzberg's core/non-core proposal. According to the Chamber, Burton is interested in the concept and wants to get Allan's thoughts.  The Chamber is very interested in hearing more about the proposal which they attribute to Enron and would like documentation.  Could someone please forward the appropriate documents to me.  I also suggested that the Chamber and Enron circle back to discuss the item in greater detail as soon as possible.

IEP just completed a poll -- Davis' numbers are in ""free fall"".   Relect Davis -- 28%; Looking for Someone New -- 61%. IEP is expecting coordinated attacks on the generators and marketers to continue and increase. Daily beatings -- probably one company after another. IEP is planning a Cal Journal ad for July to show that blackouts are a supply problem, not a price problem and may bring LBJ back for another round. IEP is beginning to work on messages for the summer -- when things are really expected to get bad.  Planning some pieces (1) how much CA could have saved if they had entered into long-run contracts last summer; (2) supply issues -- NW problem (town emerging from the muck); (3) outage numbers -- fix now, so can run during the summer, of course you take gens off line in off-peak hours. The Democratic Congressional Committee has requested time from all the major radio stations in Sacramento from May 26 through June 1.  Theory is that it will be used to respond to the President's visit. SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802

The Regulatory Affairs Committee is noticing the entire IEP membership inviting participation by all the commpanies interested in property tax matters. Last week, Controller Connell indicated an interest in shifting the jurisdiction over property tax assessment applied to electric generators from the local level to the State Board of Equalization (SBE).  IEP engaged in this matter in 1998/1999.  Attached is a brief summary memo of the key issues at that time.  At that time, IEP successfully argued for retaining jurisdictional authority at the local level. The SBE may take this issue up at its June 20, 2001 meeting.  The SBE is comprised of five voting members.  The membership is divided 3:2 between democrats and republicans. The initial meeting of the Subcommittee will be a conference call scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Thursday, May 31.

Mirant and Duke Pull In Mirant and Duke are trying to shut down Gary Ackerman of the WPTF.  This appears to be coming directly from Gov Davis.  Mirant admitted that Gov Davis had pressured them to shut down Gary (presumably as part of Mirant's recently completed negotiations over a long-term power sale). Mirant said it may be leaving WPTF if it doesn't get its way.  Reliant was also talking general caution.  So far, the majority of WPTF members are holding firm.  Gary will continue his outreach with media but curb the use of any inflammatory language. Reliant's FallOut From Advertising Reliant has run a bit of image advertising in CA in a few newspapers.  They were contacted by an organization that supposedly represents black-owned newspapers. The organization will begin running a campaign against Reliant saying the company is racist and should be boycotted. Direct Access and the Dems (through Alliance for Retail Markets contacts) The Governor's office has said that ""you'll get direct access, but you won't like it"" and mentioned requiring DA customers to pick up $3.5 billion in ""overcharges""  --  ""You people wanted deregulation and are responsible for the way it turned out, so now you have to pay for it.""  Sen. Burton(Majority Leader) said that its ""too soon"" for direct access. And Sen. Bowen's (chair Senate Energy Com) energy advisor said ""There will never be an unfettered right to direct access, so don't keep pushing for it."" AReM will step up efforts to educate the Dems and attempt to get a powerful Dem to champion the cause.  Also, three separate rumor sources said that Loretta Lynch is moving ahead on her own, without Davis' approval, and that the Governor's office is in a tizzy about it -- even thinking of politically-correct ways to get her out of there -- judgeships anyone?

Everyone, A few months ago Enron was contacted by the firm Barnes Mosher Whitehurst Lauter & Partners.  Enron was asked to join a new coalition called the California Energy Alliance.  The purpose of CEA is to identify opinion leaders, union members and registered voters who can be mobilized in support of streamlining California's process for building power plants. Both Paul and I have had conversations with the partners at BMWL.  Today, I left a message for one of the partners that Enron will not be participating in the coalition and wished them well in their efforts.  I wanted you all to be aware of the telephone call and understand that Enron would not be involved in the coalition's efforts.

Make no mistake: Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in months ahead. But for the first time since California's energy markets went haywire last summer, industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally may have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs. ""California is not yet out of the woods,"" said Kelley Doolan, who tracks natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts. ""But this is a

Mike Day spoke with Comm Brown's advisor who said that he expected Brown to continue to support direct access. Brown is the swing vote on the CPUC. That would mean that there are still 3 votes for direct access and only two votes to kill it. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 
From one of the ARM members below. Our latest info is that there are still 3 votes in SUPPORT of direct access. So, this measure would fail if that SUPPORT stays in place.  ARM and others plan a campaign to attack this draft decision. From Commonwealth: I have that Linda Serizawa, Commissioner Wood's advisor, has stated that Commissioner Wood is at this moment drafting the decision on direct access. She indicated that a draft order would be released, but would not say when. She stated that ABX1-1 directed the CPUC to set a date at which time a customer would no longer have the right to switch to an ESP, and indicated that this order, as it is currently drafted, establishes that date. Apparently there was great hesitant when making the statement ""as it is presently drafted,"" indicating to that Wood is getting a lot of pressure not to set the date. Sue Mara Enron Corp.

what do you think about this idea? 
What ""polluting"" Enron plant is he speaking of? 
FYI Bob 
Is EES or ENA planning to attend the ISO's vendor fair and stakeholder meeting mentioned below?.  Gov Affairs was not planning on it unless one of you need us to go and we'll see if we can fit it in.  As you can see, one of our cusomters is asking about it. 
Here's what I have:  I'm sure I'm on time in some time zone somewhere.  Tim Belden is due back from vacation on Monday.  The West desk would not give me any valuation estimates until Tim returned. EES PTR, Phase I Enron was the only party that raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an artificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers (RAP '98).  The CPUC shined us on. Later, we ensured that it became part of ARM's case in PTR Phase I. The way the ""cap"" worked, the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX credit when prices were high -- they would pay a credit that, when added to the other bill components, did not exceed the frozen rate for the direct access customer, thereby costing ESPs potentially a lot of  money.  It was clear in the previous CPUC direct access decisions that UDCs had no right to cap direct access credits. Because of our good case and the fact that the UDCs believed the chance of such high PX prices was LOW, the UDCs settled with ARM on this issue in 1999. 2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $30 - 40 million % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90% Green Credit Legislation Enron and other green suppliers began work in 1998 to extend the credit given for sales of green power. The credit was scheduled to end by 2002. In 1999, the money specified in AB 1890 was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain took the lead in pressing for legislation. We actively supported Green Mountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups, working with envrionmental organizations, and spearheading legislative amendments. Although this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISO/PX issues, the green credit portion of the bill remained intact.  We had also decided jointly to propose a ten-year credit and were very pleased and surprised that it survived into the final bill.  Governor Davis is expected to sign the bill. 2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $50 million % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 25% RAP '99 Enron, through ARM, has successfully made its case that retail procurement and retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that all customers pay.  Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their bills in addition to the PX credit. Enron was the first party to raise these issues as part of RAP '98 and got a Commission decision in that case to determine the credit in RAP '99.  In RAP '99, Enron chose to use ARM to litigate the case as a cheaper alternative.  Hearings were completed in the Spring of 2000.  ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and has convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to counteract the unfavorable ALJ decision. An additional credit of from $0.25 to $0.30/MWh is expected.  The decision will be voted out within the next two months. 2000 NPV estimted by Dennis Benevides: $1 - 5 million % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 75% ECT FTR Release April 1, 2000 I have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I joined the Company in 11/96.  Our long and painful fight with creeping nodalism culminated with the release of some, but not all, FTRs in April of this year.  ENA actively participated in the auction and became the largest single purchaser of FTRs.  The new congestion management approach, which Enron also spearheaded, will require 100% release of FTRs, but will not take effect until next year. This valuation looks only at the FTR release in 2000. 2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden: To be determined 9/17/00 % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90% ISO Price Caps ENA was long in the market in the West and had millions at risk when lower price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June.  Government Affairs, working with Dave Parquet and others, was instrumental in significantly delaying the movement to lower price caps, thereby giving ENA time to move out of those positions.  The following events happened in 2000.  We entered the year with a price cap of $750, having fought to raise it to that level in 1999.  In March 2000, the ISO considered lowering the price cap to $500 but voted to leave it at $500, because they believed at the time that market power had been adequately mitigated.  After the four very high-priced days in June, the ISO considered lowering the price cap to $250 with a vote on June 22, but the vote failed by ONE VOTE. Instead, the Board lowered the price cap to $500.  The Board voted again on July 1 to lower the cap and again the vote failed by ONE VOTE.  Finally, on August 1, the Board approved the $250 price cap, effective August 7.  In June, Government Affairs intitiated an all-out lobbying effort to convince Board members and their constituents to oppose lower price caps.  We also lobbied interest groups, banks, venture capitalists, NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with individual Board Members and the Board itself, going so far as to set up a special arrangement with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address the Board telephonically. 2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden: To be determined 9/17/00 % Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 80% New Market-Oriented Board Member The ISO recently held Board elections for the first time.  Government Affairs actively sought market-oriented individuals to run for the Board and replace those that do not support competitive markets.  Enron was successful in getting about five to run.  The Members selected or confrmed by the EOB have been held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats. However, one seat of interest has been decided.  Dave Parquet suggested a potential municipal representative who was extremely market-oriented (Michael Wood, City Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh).  Government Affairs worked with him closely to decide which seat to run for, help him prepare his application, suggest lobbying tactics, assist in lobbying and support him with other Board Members.  He won the election and became a Board Member in early September.  This effort is significant, because the munis voted nearly 100% in support of lower price caps. The position he took was one of those votes.  All other things being equal, we have now added a vote on our side that could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or additional price caps, given the close votes that have taken place thus far. 2000 NPV estimated based on Tim Belden's Pice Cap Assessment: To be determined 9/17/00 % Attibuted to Enron's Efforts: 100% 
Does the state of CA have the authority to do this?

PG&E is trying to rewrite history.  As I mentioned, the following Advice Letter requests that the CPUC value hydro at $2.8 billion versus $1 billion effective June 28, 2000.  We are concerned that the purpose of this maneuver is so that PG&E can claim the rate freeze had ended at the end of June and that they can pass on the high cost of energy beginning July to retail customers versus incurring the shareholder risks. I'm almost surprised PG&E didn't claim the value effective June 12 -- the day before the high prices began.  This is disgusting.  PG&E has absolutely no shame!  We'll be making an all-out effort to keep this from happening.  Hope we can work together.

I spoke with the Ca ISO attorney, Jeanne Sole, today.  She said that the ISO is planning to do the following on DG and will announce it soon. Generators smaller than 1 MW will not be considered Participating Generators under the ISO Tariff. Generators smaller than 10 MW will not require  telemetering For Generators smaller than 1 MW , there will be no prohibition on netting, although the TAC and GMA will still apply -- the ISO will allow the generator to ""estimate"" the charges.  I explored this a bit and she could not explain it any better -- except it seems that they may be moving toward giving up on those charges for small generators or wink/winking at the DG ""estimates"". For Generators smaller than 1 MW there will be no metering requirements form the ISO, only requirements from the ""local regulatory authroity."" (CPUC  or munis) This looks promising.  I hope it's the beginning of more ISO flexibility in 
PG&E pretty much lays it on the line.  We have already talked to customer groups.  This could be a great opportunity for us to get some real changes in the market ""Mr. Glynn noted that before the high wholesale power prices began to be experienced in June 2000, revenues from frozen rates were sufficient to recover transition costs because revenues at frozen rates exceeded costs, including wholesale power purchase costs.  Reacting to some media commentary that the Utility could waive the recovery of a material amount of transition costs, with an associated material write-off of the foregone transition costs, such that transition costs would have been recovered as of a date when there were no deferred wholesale power purchase costs, Mr. Glynn indicated that was one of several possible approaches for the Utility to assess.  Mr. Glynn indicated that, if the value of the Utility's hydroelectric generating assets, as reflected in the settlement agreement filed by the Utility and other parties on August 9, 2000, were to be credited to the transition costs, then such costs would have been fully recovered during August 2000.  Mr. Glynn based his statement on the following facts:  Without considering the value of the Utility's hydroelectric assets, at August 31, 2000, the Utility's estimated remaining uncollected transition costs that must be collected during the transition period were approximately $1.6 billion.  As previously disclosed, the settlement agreement filed by the Utility and others on August 9, 2000, regarding the valuation and disposition of the Utility's hydroelectric assets, specifies that the value of those assets for purpose of transition cost calculation is $2.8 billion, which would be reduced by its book value of approximately $700 million.  Testimony taken to date in the CPUC proceeding where valuation is to be established put the range of market values from $2.4 billion to in excess of $3 billion under operating and market conditions prior to June 2000.

PG&E pretty much lays it on the line in its recent 8K filing.  Obviously, no one should be throwing the customers to the wolves in this time of high prices (especially when POG&E duped them into believing that the rolloff could be no earlier than next year)  PG&E seems to be ready to negotiate.  I hope we can work together to get some real changes in the retail market to make dergulation work.

I have a pretty major philosophical disagreement with AMendment 30.  I come from the camp that says we want an ISO that has minimal duties.  If the ISO is able to enter into forward contracts, well ... how is that any different from a vertically-integrated utility? Let's see, so the ISO controls all the T and now will control some G.  Aren't we concerned about that? I have heard from some that this is the ""best solution"" -- I need someone to explain to me why. 
EPSA needs feedback on Cal and Alliance filings and what position EPSA can take.  Thoughts? 
MEMORANDUM TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM: Don Santa, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Joe Hartsoe, Power Marketing Working Group Chair Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy DATE: September 20, 2000 RE:  ? Cal ISO Amendment 30 ? Alliance RTO Filing Two issues arose on the weekly conference call today on which we need your assistance and feedback.  Please forward comments to Julie Simon at 202-789-7200 or jsimon@epsa.org by close of business on Monday, September 25th. 1. Cal ISO Amendment 30 On September 11, 2000 the Cal ISO filed Amendment No. 30 to its ISO Tariff at FERC.  In this filing, the Cal ISO is ""reluctantly"" asking FERC for authority to buy forward contracts to meet its real-time balancing obligations.  Costs of the forward contracts would be allocated to Scheduling Coordinators who deviate in real time from their schedules.  Interventions and protests are due on October 2nd. While EPSA has consistently opposed an ISO role as market participant, there are concerns here about the lack of alternatives available in California. While an ISO's role in the real-time balancing market should be small, as a practical matter, the Cal ISO has been forced to procure thousands of megawatts in the real time markets.  Thus, deciding how to approach this filing balances difficult competing goals.  Please let us know how you would like EPSA to proceed. 2. Alliance RTO On September 15th the Alliance RTO made a compliance filing at FERC seeking to address all of FERC's concerns about its earlier proposals and purporting to meet all the requirements of Order No. 2000.  The filing retains a transco structure, with a 5 percent ownership limitation for individual market participants and a 15 percent ownership limitation on each class of market participants.  It also eliminates pancaked rates in favor of zonal, or license plate, rates for deliveries within the Alliance and postage-rates for through or out deliveries.  While the geographic scope is unchanged, the scope will be larger than any operating RTO.  The filing includes a pro-forma inter-RTO coordination agreement to address seams issues such as security coordination, market monitoring, regional planning ATC and TTC calculations and pricing reciprocity. Until now, EPSA has not been a party to the Alliance proceeding.  With this latest filing it may be appropriate for EPSA to intervene, raising issues of support or opposition to the filing.  To determine how to proceed, however, we need input from those companies that have been more closely involved in the development of the Alliance.  Please let us know how EPSA should proceed with respect to this latest filing.

Some corrections to the write-up for the first one for EES, some attribtuon changes (I think) and an additional valuation for EES.  Also, includes changes to the write-ups for ENA and what I got from Tim Belden.  I also have a note discussing Tim Belden's ""philosophy"" in giving me valuations. EES RAP '98 Enron raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an artificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers during the very first proceedings during which the method of CTC collection was raised.  The CPUC shined us on. Later, we raised it in the very first Revenue Adjustment Proceeding (RAP '98) RAP '98 
Do any of the sets of message points on which you worked suit this purpose? 
I have heard twice now in two conferences that California is the perfect example of why restructuring/deregulation is undesirable and should not be instituted in India.  I typically speak up and state that the regulatory structure is mostly to blame for the operational difficulties (brown-outs, etc.) stating that the wires business remains regulated always.  I don't really have an answer for the soaring spot market prices in California.  Do we have any written explanation of the situation in California or could we write one?  It would be very helpful to us here.  As restructuring becomes more and more hotly debated, especially once the Electricity Bill is debated in Parliament, we will need this kind of support.  Thanks in advance.

I've got the things rolling at WPTF 
Folks, Enron has requested that we have a Board meeting teleconference on Thursday, September 28 at 10 a.m. to discuss the ramifications of the ISO's Tariff Amendment 30.  This amendment allows the ISO to procure firm energy in the forward market for the purpose of maintaining reliability. Enron's interest in this matter is that a party such as WPTF would be ideal to pose tough questions to the FERC which call to their attention that the ISO is supposed to be a transmission operator only, and that granting them the authority to procure energy is a step towards the old regime of vertically integrated monopolies. AUDIO ACCESS INFORMATION: ========================== Toll Number: +1-712-257-2281 Passcode: 50702 Conference Leader: Mr Gary Ackerman MEETING INFORMATION: ===================== Confirmation Number: 9069003 The FERC filing date, I think, was September 12.  Therefore, I think we have 30 days to respond.  A quorum of at least six Board members will be required for the vote, and of that number, 2/3 must approve any motion the Board adopts. gba

Neede d to brief Governor's Office I certainly don't see why this is confidential.  Distribution wheeling has been ""my baby"" at Enron for years but I don't see Anthony Mazy contributing anything to the effort.  We don't need a big conference, or 150 people, or the Governor. We just need the CPUC and the FERC to say ""Stop the Madness and Open the System."" So, I won't be participating.  Thanks for asking. MBD <MDay@GMSSR.com> on 09/25/2000 05:43:49 PM

I am a Registered Proffessional Engineer who has specialized in Electrical Transmission and Power Plants. I have designed and built facilities in most of the U.S. and many overseas countries. I Started as a Transmission Engineer for Houston Lighting and Power Co, in 1950. I had previously worked as a serviceman while enrolled in Rice University. My father was a lineman since 1917 . I had a 12 year career as a Professor  at the University of Houston. I don"" know just who is at Enron San Francisco now. Dave Parquet and Sam When know me and perhaps there are others. What I asked Jim Steffis about was getting a heads up from you whenever any thing was coming up that I needed to be aware of with an RTO or ISO that would help me to understand the rules as they change rather than be hit in the face with them afterwards.

Everyone is well aware of the energy price issue Everyone is angry Everyone is blaming Steve Peace Everyone also thinks SDG&E is to blame -- that the utility is gouging People are supportive of a competitive energy market People don't buy the argument that reregulation will help consumers People are OK with having caps until more generation comes on line AND people will settle for reregulation if they can't have competition His assessment was that Steve Peace's career is over and that the administration wants desperately to ensure that this issue goes away by the

Don't you love Bob Glynn referring to AB 1890 as providing ""Mutually Assured Destruction""? Douglas Condon 09/27/2000 10:33 AM 
Where were these discussions when AB1890 was being created? California Utilities' Losses On Electricity Pose Risk By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL California's two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the state's deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months. If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year. That would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the ""too big to fail'' response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks. Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- rating concerns say they aren't sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills. ""If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can get through it,"" says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch IBCA. ""If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a very serious

WPTF has just voted to file a protest on Amendment 30 (the ISO is asking to be able to buy power for itself in the forward market).  I agreed to fund as did 4, maybe 5, others.  The discussion was not exactly as you describe below but I will be able to have lots of input on the filing, and am sure I can get the points included.  Therefore, I recommend that Enron NOT make a separate filing on this. Here is what WPTF voted on:  Ask FERC to limit ISO procurement only to the super peak product that has already been developed by the APX and require that the price caps end in 6 months; if the ISO wishes to renew the price caps it would have to file 60 days in advance of the 6-month deadline. Mary Hain@ECT 09/28/2000 12:28 PM 
Sue- in WPTF's protest of Amendment 30, is WPTF proposing to make the following arguments?  If not we need to have Ron give an estimate for an RCR and draft a protest. Amendment 30, which would allow the Cal ISO to do limited forward contracting and to allocate the costs thereof to under/overschedulers (protests due Oct.2)the traders would like to say that the ISO should not be in the forward market, rather the IOUs should be in the forward market and should be incented to do so.  Rather than doing anything to fix this failure to hedge and underscheduling by the IOUs, this filing would further amplify the problem by concentrating even more transactions with the ISO and lead to the slippery slope to the ISO running the entire market. Since, the filing also creates other problems.  Through the proposal to do bilateral deals without first receiving bids, the ISO moved itself out of compliance with Order No. 2000 (assuming it ever complied) by starting to violate the independence characteristic - the FERC's first minimum characteristic for an RTO.  Under this, the RTO is required to be independent of market participants.  Order No. 2000 defines a market participant as any entity or its affiliate that buys or sells electric energy in the RTO's region or in any neighboring region that might be effected by the RTO's actions. Further, the ISO is already buying out of market and this move would further complicate existing problems that we have with OOM. In addition, although the filing claims that it's request is  limited, yet there is no time limitation.  Further, the limitation seems to have little real effect.

It's not good.  Davis wants to cut the price caps in half.  He believes you need to keep the utilities in good financial shape or there won't be any ""California-based companies to invest in generation and transmission."" And he wants ""CA companies to determine the destiny of CA consumers"".  All this sounds pretty bad to me.

refund authority 
refund authority In his comments, Hoecker asks Congress to give FERC retroactive refund authority.  By the way this article is wrong about the refund effective date.  The current refund effective date is 60 days from the date FERC's order was published in the Federal Register.  It was pushed on August 30, so if in a future order the Commission were to require refunds, they would be calculated beginning October 29th. 
Just curious, but do we agree that the PX is the most liquid forward market, or is the OTC already more liquid that the PX?   thanks  mcs 
Do you know this guy?  I can't place him. 
The problem is not ""deregulation."" The fact is Oregon is not deregulated yet and rates are going through the roof. Also, one only needs to look back to 1980-85 when rates in the Northwest went up 250% over a five year period because of nukes. This occurred in a fully regulated environment. The problem is that many consumers do not have a true choice to secure a fixed price long-term contract. You can not put the toothpaste back into the tube! I hope Enron takes the high road on this issue and pushes for expedited siting of new generation. The best way to accomplish this is to agree to compliance with emissions standards and meeting off-sets where they exist. Where off-sets do not exist, I think Enron can commit to paying for energy efficiency investments in partnership with utilities or industrial customers that take the out-put (or take equity) at our new plants. Paying for conservation, which is running about 19-22 mills in the Northwest, is a pretty inexpensive way to accomplish good will with end-users and utilities.

DJ Mkt Manipulation Caused Calif Pwr Crisis - State Senator Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California's power costs surged this summer, not because of a supply shortage, but because power suppliers were able withhold generation until the last possible moment and command ""exorbitantly"" high prices, State Sen. Steve Peace said in a letter sent to federal regulators. In the letter dated Oct. 3 and obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the senator, one of the architects of deregulation in the state, charges that the state's power market was ""collusively structured"" and pleads with federal regulators to take action against instate generation owners for ""unlawful"" behavior. Peace, D-Chula Vista, compared the state's power market to a World Wrestling Federation match, saying it only had the appearance of competition. ""A WWF bout has all of the surface elements associated with competition, but the outcome is driven by a script rather than by the spontaneous consequences of competition,"" Peace says in the letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Chairman James Hoecker. ""Similarly, participants in the wholesale electric market are not responding to market signals, they are simply following a script written... to satisfy the most naive and 
I always like an activity -- I like to include kids too if that's OK with others I'm fine with including the rest of the office -- that would probably limit any activity we would do -- the other business units would have to agree to accept any liability to cover last minute back outs (like ENA two years ago).

Word on the street is that the CA ISO staff is NOT asking for a vote on price caps at the Board meeting on Thursday.  (I was speculating that the Board would be asked to lower the price caps to $100 or to adopt the CEO's proposal, which he filed at FERC on 10/20.)  The vote will be put off a vote until late November.  No reason given -- but presumably so they don't look like idiots if FERC comes out with something radically different on November 1. But, I have also heard that one Board member -- Mike Florio of TURN -- has asked for a vote on his proposal -- load-differentiated price caps (e. g.$250 when area load is 40,000 MW or more, $150 when load is between 30,000 and 40,000, etc.) If a few Board members, i.e., the utilities and some of the munis gang up, they can force a vote.  I'm expecting one, but given the staff's/CEO position, there may not be sufficient votes to go lower until FERC comes out with its proposal. 
Good stuff on CA -- also PECO and default

Cal-ISO/FERC -2: Companies Allegedly Gamed Power Market Updated: Friday, June 8, 2001 05:29 PM ET   Email this article to a friend! Printer-friendly version LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market.  Duke Energy (DUK, news, msgs), Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs), Mirant Corp. (MIR, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, msgs) have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power - the ability to influence electricity prices - in California's wholesale power market. The ISO, which manages the state's high-voltage transmission system, recently made a similar filing against AES Corp. (AES, news, msgs) and Williams Cos. (WMB, news, msgs), claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power.  The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators' authority to charge market-based rates for their power supply. Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations.  ""We've obviously just got the filing and we're reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing. But we're also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down,"" Williams said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said the ISO's allegations are ""nothing new.""  ""It's similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators,"" Wheatley said. ""The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief. The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand. The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be

looms as a high political hurdle 
Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854 
looms as a high political hurdle Dan Walters: Repaying huge power debts still looms as a high political hurdle (Published June 13, 2001) Gov. Gray Davis has been running around California lately proclaiming that California is ""turning the corner"" on the energy crisis, explicitly citing sharply lower wholesale prices for electricity and, implicitly, his improved standing in polls. Events will reveal whether Davis' June hubris was justified. Despite the recent drop in spot power prices, however, many aspects of the energy crisis remain unresolved, and chief among them is liquidating the $20 billion-plus in debts that utilities and the state have accumulated for power purchases. A $13.4 billion bond issue that is supposed to reimburse the state's general fund for more than $8 billion advanced for power purchases and then finance future electricity buys has been hung up by demands of potential bond underwriters for more assurances about repayment. The bonds may not be sold until August, if ever. And by then, nearly the entire bond issue may have to flow to the state's general fund, leaving little to finance future power buys. And then there are the $14 billion or so in debts that the state's two big utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, incurred for power purchases before their credit was cut off in January. PG&E already has declared bankruptcy, and Edison was on the verge when Davis hurriedly signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" (MOU) on a rescue scheme, the centerpieces being state purchase of Edison's share of the intercity power grid, plus a plan for ratepayers to pay off the utility's debts. The Edison scheme has been denounced as a ""bailout"" by consumer activists and faces certain legislative rejection, despite a multimillion-dollar lobbying and public relations drive by the utility. And it's sparked a complex set of private maneuvers in and around the Capitol that are fraying the already cool relations between Davis and the Legislature's most powerful leader, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton. Davis called a dozen senators into his office Monday to press approval of the Edison MOU with minimal changes. Burton, who didn't attend, says the governor threatened legislators with rejection of their bills or budget appropriations if they didn't play ball, and promised retaliation if Davis uses strong-arm tactics for Edison. ""On an issue like this, they (legislators) ought to be able to vote their consciences,"" Burton told reporters, denouncing the Edison deal as a

Access Two proposed decisions were issued by hard copy and received today.  Jim Steffes' office in Houston has a copy. Both decisions eliminate the requirement that the utilities provide cash refunds to the direct access customers for the negative PX Credit as of Januray 5, 2000. On other points they differ. The decision by Assigned Commissioner Wood is adversarial to direct access and suspends direct access. If adopted, direct access would be suspended July 1, 2001, except for written contracts executed prior to July 1, 2001.  On the PX Credit, he says that the cash payment is not required and leaves open the notion that the bill credit would continue. The alternate decision by Commissioner Bilas does not suspend direct access but asks for ideas on how to provide DA given ABX 1 and the concerns of the state's Dept of Finance when providing comments on the draft decision.  Bilas has a finding of fact that ""direct access is a necessary component of restoration of functional electricity markets."" On the PX credit, Bilas' proposed decision would end the cash payment but begin a process to modify the PX credit decision (D.99-06-058) and to adopt a bottoms-up calculation for direct access customers.  He asks for comments in 20 days and reply comments in 5 days. With a bottoms-up calculation, direct access customers would pay only wires charges and public purpose charges and pay no charge for power purchases. Comments on the draft decisiona are due next Monday, June 25. Enron and its coalitions will actively support the Bilas alternate and seek the third vote needed to ensure passage. Sue Mara Enron Corp.

Attached for your review and comment is my first draft of comments to be filed on Monday with regard to the draft decisions of ALJ Barnett and Commissioner Bilas.? Please review it carefully, as I have thrown in everything I can think of on a rush basis, and it may require some significant  editing.? Pay particular attention to Section V dealing with Bilas' request  for parties to discuss alternatives to DA suspension.? The draft offers a  compromise to the DWR's concerns, as expressed in the Angelides memo.?  Also, notice that Section VI urges the Commission to bifurcate the DA and PX  credit issues, acting quickly on the first, if it must, but more leisurely on  the PX credit subject. ? Finally, I have a suggestion?in the form of a question.? How  would AReM members feel about making this a joint filing with WPTF?? There  is cross-membership between the two groups and the same issues would be raised in the separate filings which I am otherwise prepared to draft.? This draft would requires some modifications so as to refer to the ""Joint Parties"" as opposed to solely mentioning AReM, and I might? add a section dealing more explicitly with WPTF's contribution to getting the zero minimum bill stipulation  signed in the first place.? Otherwise, the document would stay much as it  is (subject to your input over the next few days, of course).? Please let  me know what you think asap, as I am already working on a WPTF draft.?  Incidentally, I will also be filing comments on behalf of ABAG which will  support the positions taken in the attached document, but I am not proposing  that ABAG also be a party to this filing.?

Monday, last week, I urged our retail coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM), to hold a press conference this week to draw media attention to the CPUC's vote on Thursday to suspend direct access.  AReM and its PR Firm agreed.  After a lot of work to line up customers, the press conference was held Tuesday morning in Scaramento. We had excellent turnout from customer groups.  Public statements of support for continuing direct access were made by the California Chamber of Commerce, CA Manufacturing and Technology Association, CA Large Electric Consumers Association, CA Retailers Association, School Project for RR (SPURR - forget the whole acronym but the org purchases gas and electricity for aggregated elementary and high schools), QUALCOM, City of Palm Springs, NYMEX, and the ESPs of Green Mountain, New Energy , Enron (me), and Strategic Energy.  All the major papers were there, San Jose Mercury News, SF Chronicle, LA Times, SD Union, OC Register, Wall Street Jr.  Also there were the energy trade press, Bloomberg, Public Radio and a capitol TV station.  All had the opportunity to ask questions of the customers. As planned, we let the customers take the limelight.  They made forceful cases for why the CPUC should not suspend DA and stressed that the Treasurer's concerns have been addressed in legislation (that has not yet been acted on) and are actively being negotiated at the Capitol.  They urged the CPUC not to take this action. I'll forward any media that results from this Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802

CONFIDENTIAL -- FERC SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS I have proposed quite a few changes and additions to the list.  I also ask some questions re some of the items listed. I added a section on Retail Reforms -- we cannot settle with the state unless we settle everything -- otherwise we know the outcome to expect. regarding your question on hourly day ahead markets -- I assume you're referring to the energy market that the PX used to run, because the CAISO already has day-ahead markets for congestion and ancillary services.  I discussed this proposal with Tim in March because the ISO's filing at FERC for market reforms had the ISO setting up such a market -- essentially putting the former PX inside the ISO (and for all you historians, finally creating the dream of POOLCO for California).  Tim asked us to oppose that proposal -- his view at the time was that we didn;t want the ISO running energY markets, because private third parties could do a much better job of that.  So, we opposed that in our filings commenting on the ISO's proposal in March. I'll be in the office Wednesday (Oops! Today).  Can we discuss this list and where we are headed? Sue Mara Enron Corp.

on 'direct access' Here's a direct access article that appeared on the front page of today's San Francisco Chronicle. This article gives Pat Wood of FERC's position supporting direct access in California.  Edelman worked with Bernadette Tansey on this article  and provided her with information on AReM and the DA coalition's goals, as well as background on direct access.  We are also currently working with the Chronicle's Editorial board to secure an editorial **************************************** Bush appointee warns state PUC on 'direct access' FERC panelist wants consumers to retain choice of energy firms Zachary Coile, Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday, June 28, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/28/MN207167.DTL Washington -- President Bush's key federal energy regulator warned California that it may hurt consumers if the state approves a proposal to bar power users from shopping around for the best prices for electricity. Patrick Wood, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Bush's liaison to the state on energy issues, criticized a plan before the California Public Utilities Commission to suspend a major element of the state's 1996 deregulation plan. Called ""direct access,"" the program allows businesses to cut deals with private power suppliers and permits consumers to choose among competing electricity providers, including firms that market renewable sources of energy. Members of the state PUC, which had been set to consider the issue today, said yesterday that they will delay the vote on direct access until Tuesday at the urging of Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Wood, who met with state PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch during a two-day trip to California earlier this week, said he fears that ending direct access will lock consumers into higher energy prices. ""I do worry about the future of retail competition,"" he said yesterday in Washington. ""I think a lot of things they're trying to do to resolve today's problem may really push off the benefits of direct access for quite a few

The memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on Aug 13 that puts in place shortened appeal times at the CPUC.  The memo says that the CPUC does not need to act on the key issues, including suspension of DA, until Aug 13 or later.  It also says the bonds are now to be sold in Sept-Oct. The memo states that the CPUC, Governor, Treasurer, etc. have agreed with the new timetable. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854

The Chief ALJ of the CPUC has put out for comment in the rate stabilization case a proposed services agreement between DWR and PG&E to cover meter reading and billing services provided to DWR by PG&E.  Of note is the fact that DWR will pay $1.7 million as a set up fee and between $80,000 and $115,000 a year for such services over the next four years.  Please advise if you want to review this agreement.  If direct access remains viable, this may represent an interesting precedent for utility billing and metering costs. Mike Day

Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th. I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill? Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal. Best,

Below are the notes from our lobbyist who attended the meeting today of opponents for the language to change the requirements for those getting e-signatures for selling products and services to small customers.  From the diversity of the group opposing the bill and the fact that the Attorney General and Peace are involved, I recommend that we stay on the sidelines and monitor this.

As I mentioned earlier this week, my associate Cliff Berg, representing AOL, co-sponsored a meeting in our office today regarding AB 256 (Wayne).  The meeting was run by Kay Caldwell on behalf of the Internet Alliance.  Kay was the one who contacted Jeff Dodd in Houston who I believe contacted one or both of you. The bill is being opposed by AOL, Microsoft, Charles Schwab, CMTA, Chamber, GTE/Verizon, AEA, Retailers, Financial Services Association and the Internet Alliance.  All of those parties are scheduled to meet with Assembly Member Wayne at different times on Wednesday to try and get him to drop the bill which is being sponsored by the Attorney General.  In the event that fails, the group is also trying to get the bill double-referred to the Senate Banking Committee where they have a much better chance of stopping it versus the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The bill will be heard by the Judiciary Committee on August 21. With respect to Enron's participation in any opposition effort, there was some concern that the Judiciary Committee may not be the best place because Peace is on that committee and would likely do anything to get at Enron (support?).  Regardless of anyone's concerns we could submit a letter of opposition so long as someone provides me with the general framework. Please advise. Scott

Hi Wanda/Michael.  You aware of this?  I don't recall having received anything from PG&E. Best, Jeff 
PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen. We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits. I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want to discover there's a charge we don't know about. Thanks, Tamara.

They acknowledge that AB XX 82 is a bad bill. We will be having a teleconf on this tomorrow with all the ESP consolidated billers. So far, I've told New West that it would likely be better for them, if Enron stays away from formally supporting this, given the target on our face in the Legislature.  More important, I need to know if EES would like to see some PX credit language in legislation. I have some questions about the approach New West took in modifying the legislation, so, I have a call into them. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854

In case you didn't see it 7/16/01 -- Palmer quoted Senate power play jolts Enron  'The whole thing stinks to high heaven."" That was the assessment Adrian Moore, executive director of Reason Public Policy Institute, gave of a state Senate committee's recent move to hold Enron Corp. in contempt for refusing to hand over subpoenaed documents.  We're inclined to agree. The Texas-based energy merchant has filed a countersuit in Sacramento Superior Court, arguing that the Senate has no right to wield influence beyond state borders and that putting the documents into public view ""jeopardized confidential business information,"" the Register reported Thursday.  The court should order the Senate either to make its document request more specific or to drop the contempt charge and subpoena altogether. Robert Levy, a constitutional law expert at the Cato Institute, told us that Enron's point about disclosing confidential information will be its strongest argument in court.  While Enron can't hide behind state borders, Levy says the Senate's request is not tailored narrowly enough to ensure information that could damage Enron's market viability is not released. He said the Senate should have to let a judge decide whether releasing the documents is necessary for its investigation and avoids unfairly harming Enron.  Instead, the full Senate just has to approve the committee's recommendation for Enron's executives to become criminals. ""It seems to me that's a scary

Sue, From this link: http://oasis.caiso.com/ the information your are looking for can be obtained.  Once the CA ISO OASIS homepage comes up, click on the ""System Load"" tab in the upper righthand corner, this will bring you to the ""System Load Reports"" page.  From this page you can query the ISO's database. From trying to query the data, I have found out that you can request no more than 31 days of data at a time. Hope this helps, any questions, just let me know. Kind Regards, 
I couldn't get my computer to pull AB 189 from home.  I did talk to Counihan. His view is that the bill does not repeal the operative provisions of AB 1890 for DA, Sec 365.  As I mentioned it does repeal the whereas part, Sec 330. He agrees, however, that as soon as it passes, the CPUC will implement ABX 1 and vote to kill DA.  AReM put out a press statement on the senate passage of AB 2X78.  I think you may have received it. Sue Mara Enron Corp.

As reported to the IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee, the CEC held a workshop recently to discussed proposed regulatory language to implement the CEC's Data Report.  This activity is part of a two-year process to implement data collection and information reporting protocols by the CEC.  The protocols affect generators as well as load serving entities. IEP raised a number of concerns during the Workshop regarding the CEC's proposed language.  It is important that we put these concerns into the public record as soon as possible.  Attached are IEP's draft Comments on this matter.  Unless I hear from folks with serious concerns, I propose to file comments by COB  today, Tuesday, July 17.

All: The word from the Assembly is that there will be amendments to SB 78, which will be the vehicle addressing the Edison bailout, on Thursday, a hearing on Friday and Floor Session to follow to ratify whatever comes out of committee.  This word comes out of the Assembly energy committee (Joe Lyons) and although Rick Simpson was with the Speaker all afternoon and didn't get back to me, numerous other Members' offices confirmed that they have been told to be in town and available Friday.

Given today's Order from FERC setting ISO price caps at $250 MWh for the next 60 days and specifically rendering the October 26th ISO board vote on a load differentiated cap null and void, we have ceased efforts to implement the October 26th motion. Prior to today's Order, the ISO had been working internally and with vendors on implementation details. Also, a conference call was held with Market Participants on October 30th to assess their implementation needs. Based on this initial work, it appeared that implementation could occur in early January 2001 but this work is being stopped as a result of today's Order.

The arguments supporting= =20 this  position are as follows: Direct  access customers were specifically exempted from the=20 procurement-related rate  increase because they do not receive procurement= =20 service.? They should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month=20 procurement surcharge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled=20 service.? =20 The inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit= =20 have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under significa= nt=20 financial stress.?

Enron Individuals The workshop conducted by the Energy Division on Friday on the DWR revenue requirement submitted to the Commission on July  23rd was basically a question and answer session. A representative of DWR was present as were several representatives of the consulting firm Navigant which assisted DWR in constructing its revenue requirement request.  The representatives of Navigant fielded most of the questions. Not much new information was garnered.  A little more clarity was shed on certain areas. Of interest to Enron would be that in determining the net short for each of the UDCs for which DWR was purchasing it assumed no change in the current direct access levels (which is approximately 2% of the load in the state) through 2002. Other points of clarification included: (1) A question exists with respect to whether DWR is responsible for the ISO costs billed to the UDCs for the period of January through June of 2001. (2) Any payments which were made to DWR to date by the UDCs would be netted against the revenue requirements requests for the first and second quarter of this year.  PG&E indicated that DWR's numbers for the revenue received from PG&E to date do not match its own accounting. (3) The net short calculation for each UDC was derived by using the net short forecasts provided by each of the UDCs an modifying them to take into account (1) a 4% reduction in load due to conservation efforts; (2) a 2% reduction in load due to price elasticity increasing to 3% by January 2001; (3) estimated impacts of the 20/20 program (assuming also a similar program for next summer); (4) the impact of the UDCs curtailment programs.  Once again, PG&E indicated its belief that DWR's net short projection for PG&E was erroneous. (4)  DWR explained that the basis for the projection that they would need 1.65 cents out of the three cents rate increase was that for sales made by DWR they already receive the UDC generation rate (i.e., approximately 6.8 cent for PG&E and 7.2 cent for SCE).  On top of that, they need the 1.65 cents. SCE submitted four pages of written questions to DWR on their revenue request.  DWR is to respond in writing (and serve on all people on the service list ) by Tuesday the 31st.  To the extent that the questions are applicable to PG&E, they will answer the question with respect to both UDCs. Please call if you have any questions. Jeanne Bennett

Dear All, Attached is this week's legislative report for IEP. Despite the summer break, leaders in the Assembly planned to call back their side of the Legislature to debate and vote on a ""rescue"" plan for Southern California Edison. The new effort was outlined in our Tuesday fax to each of you.  In short, the new plan called for amending SB 78xx and AB 82xx to, among other things, provide for a dedicated rate component to support a $2.9 billion bond financing by Edison, but would have prevented Edison from using the funds to pay generators, PX and ISO invoices, directly or indirectly. The $2.9 billion could be used to pay QFs.  The dedicated rate component for repayment of the bonds would apply to all consumers for two years, and then apply solely to non-core customers.  Additionally, under the plan, the 30% haircut/trust account concept was deleted, the decision on a transmission line purchase was deferred to settlement discussions between the state and Edison, the RPS targeted a 10% growth in new generating capacity through 2010, and direct access would be permitted under certain circumstances effective no earlier than January 1, 2002.  The Assembly leadership planned on holding an informational meeting on the new plan on Thursday, July 26 and committee and floor votes on the plan today, Friday, July 27.  However, the leadership could not garner enough votes for this new plan this week, so no informational hearing was held, nor will any votes be held today.  Even if this new plan had been approved by the Assembly this week, Senator Burton's office made it very clear that Senator Burton had no intention of bringing his house back in to session to vote on the measure.  Accordingly, barring the governor calling the legislature back into session, we do not expect any other activity on this new plan before the legislature reconvenes on August 20, and perhaps not then either. Other events this week include: * In Thursday's Los Angeles Times, S. David Freeman -- Governor Davis' primary negotiator on the long-term contract deals -- authored an editorial arguing that the state's long-term energy contracts were a primary factor in the recent reduction in energy prices on the spot market.  You can find the article at www.latimes.com.  It ran on the editorial page on Thursday, July 26. * It is our understanding that on Thursday Senator Byron Sher had draft amendments prepared by his staff to amend SB 532 to address Renewable Portfolio Standards issues.  The amendments are not yet public, but we are hopeful that we will be able to obtain them when his staff returns next week.  We will keep you apprised. * FERC ordered hearings on Wednesday to determine how much money electric generators owe California for wholesale power overcharges.  With California still insisting that it is owed $8.9 billion by generators, the expected FERC decision on the refund amount is certain to fall short of the state's expectations.  Lawsuits are expected to follow issuance of the decision.  In a press statement earlier this week, the governor stated his hopes that California will receive all $8.9 billion adding, ""As for the energy profiteers and pirates, let me make clear that I will not rest until every dollar gouged from California businesses and residents returns to California. If the FERC does not make California whole, we will see you in

CalPX's take on FERC's ability to end mandatory buy requirement. DJ CalPX Responds To FERC, Denies It Worsened Power Prices Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The chief executive officer of the California Power Exchange responded Tuesday to details in a federal energy regulatory report that suggests the two-year-old exchange's mandatory buy requirement was partly to blame for this past summer's soaring wholesale electricity prices. The details of the landmark probe prepared by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to be released Wednesday morning, but some commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires the report will suggest that the state's mandatory buy rule should be abolished and utilities should be permitted to purchase their power through other power exchanges. ""We believe that the representation of the CalPX contributing to soaring wholesale prices is incorrect and misleading,"" said CalPX CEO George Sladoje. ""Over the summer months, certain wholesale market participants chose to not take full advantage of the price and cost mitigating products offered through the CalPX...if a participant chose to purchase all or most of their energy on the spot market, they often paid much more than other participants who chose to buy in the forwards market,"" Sladoje added. It is widely known in the wholesale electricity market that Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. purchased most of their power in the spot market, which the utility passed on to its customers at a much higher price. SDG&E also complained to federal regulators that the CalPX hourly and day-ahead market clearing prices are too high. When California moved to electricity deregulation four years ago, a statewide power exchange was created requiring Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. to purchase all of their power through the exchange until 2002, the expected transition date to a completely deregulated market. But the FERC report proposes that utilities be permitted to purchase power from other exchanges in an effort to generate increased competition, commissioners said. The CalPX purchases power one day in advance for California's three investor-owned utilities. Suppliers bid in power indicating their price. For each hour of the next day, the price of the last megawatt taken to meet demand sets the market price. In various reports issued since 1996, FERC has commended the state's Power Exchange for running a successful market that helped mitigate concerns about market power abuses. If the FERC report suggests that California end the mandatory buy requirement, it will be up to state lawmakers to see to draft Legislation to change the market rules, according to the CalPX. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 31-10-00

California Administration Helps Electricity Consumers by Proposing Reliability Standards and Working to Lower Costs Clinton/Gore Administration Takes Action to Help Californians Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson today announced a series of initiatives that the Clinton/Gore Administration is taking to help California reduce the strain on their electricity system and protect consumers. Most significantly, Richardson said the Administration will likely send a proposed rule-making to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish mandatory reliability standards for electricity * doing administratively what Congress failed to accomplish this year. ""California's electricity market has become dysfunctional -- and it's time to make it right,"" said Secretary Richardson.

As we discussed in our special call last week, I asked Brian Cragg from Goodin McBride to look into the issue of what, if anything, the CPUC can do in lieu of suspending direct access. ABX 1 says the CPUC ""shall suspend"" DA, but does not give any time line for doing so, nor any criterita to use in making the determination to suspend it.  This gives the CPUC ample ability to delay suspending DA, especially while bills affecting DA are in play in Sacramento. The President could have her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying the suspension.  Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in place -- although he said it was a ""stretch.""  Brian said she could, for example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of implementing ABX 1.  He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however, stretching the concept a bit too far.  Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law. She could also institute an ""open season"" through some defined date, such as Jan 1, 2002, and suspend DA thereafter. She could take this action subject to the passage of superceding legislation -- which, of course, could either kill DA altogether or implement some combination of exit fee/DAopen season/DA limitation.

California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity Gouger Gray Davis California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required 
I called Ed Chang from the Western Area Power Administration to ask about the DOE involvement. It just so happened that he had attended the press conference.  He and other state people were at a meeting to discuss how the federal agnecies could work with state agencies.  They had only been meeting for 15 minutes when they were told that they were going to be bussed over to SMUD's Hedge Substation (don't you love the name?) for the press conference. Richardson arrived with a flurry of black limos to announce his program. Ed's view is that this was all for PR and that the ""changes"" don't help California at all. The WAPA transformer referred to by Richardson is already planned and in its approved budget (it is a joint upgrade project of the 500 kV lines by WAPA, PG&E and others at the Tracy and Tesla Substations). Richardson did not even stay for the Governor's speach.  He left for the airport.  The Governor arrived in a flurry of black limos.  He addressed the FERC order a bit.  He felt FERC should have addressed the issue of refunds for CA consumers. He was also concerned about FERC's order on governance.  He said that deregulatrion was brought to us by Senator Peace and the Wilson administration, but that the market is very different now than it was in 1996.  He said he believes in competition, but that the problems in the

Here it is.  To explain, I left the sheet you saw previously as Sheet 1. Sheet 2 is the new employee and business expense budget.  It shows expenditures through 7/09/01 in the first column, our 2001 budget in the second column, and a proposed 2002 budget in the third column.  Some of the expenditures are kind of kooky -- because of miscoding or other reasons.  For example, payments to IEP appear under ""Employee Pers --Other"" and ""Outside Serv - Prof"".  There are many examples of kooky things -- so don't worry about it. We ended up getting charged for things this year that we didn't put in our budget, such as AT&T calling cards and Edith's time -- so I've tried to include all the items -- even if I put them in another category (for example, I don't use the category ""EIS Allocation"" in our budget). I included those wacky categories that we don't use in our budget at the bottom of column 1 just to get the correct total for the year to date. Sheet 3 is outside expenses such as contributions, retainers and memberships.  Column 1 shows our 2001 budget and column 3 shows our projected 2002 budget. I added some dollars to the retainers to cover some minimal expenses that we get charged.  Other than that, it's pretty much what we discussed last week. Have fun, Paul!  Call with any questions.

Sam,  I took a quick look at what Mona had done and had a few clarifying changes.  Let either of us know if you need more help. 
Gang, I didn't get Jim's e-mail but .....  Here are my comments This looks good as a bottomline message, but I'd like to dress it up and take it out on a date first (doesn't dasovich talk like this?) I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS this summer.  To the contrary, in the west, we were working with some customers (a  few hundred MWs)  to participate in the ISO's program -- after the Board voted to lower the cap to $250 -- the customers all said sayonara -- could no longer justify the expense and the interference in their operations.  These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail demand response. This only goes so far, however... The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids from the price caps.  SO, we need more... I think we should focus on the practical effects of a ""soft"" cap (not simple 
In response to Jim's E-mail  - here's is my proposed list of issues for Enron's November 9 comments.  We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow so please comment on this ASAP. We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information Here's my rationale.  Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market information to market participants.  We could summarize the positions we took in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at all and why we need information.  In addition, we should assume that they will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not addressed the problems created by OOM. In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms, balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues as we go. 
From Independent Energy Producers 
GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION'S REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis' remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) report: ""My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable. That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making a good start. ""Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day. ""Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive, which it is not. ""I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through. ""FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California. ""I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop. Question inaudible. ""It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days. Question inaudible. ""We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is. But we are making progress. Question inaudible. ""That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this ill-conceived scheme. ""I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment, critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before. ""I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon. Question inaudible. ""Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in 1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards. Question inaudible. ""You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck. Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today. Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in 1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state. FERC seems to be suggesting today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep. ""I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare. Without electricity there is no economic growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations.

GREETINGS: So, we're all happy that FERC finally made a decision.  Traders tell me the market has stabilized and people think much of the regulatory uncertainty has ended.  NOT SO FAST..... I am NOT an attorney -- but here are my current guesses. ISSUE:  FERC has created a huge constitutional issue with the state of CA. The FERC has ordered the ISO to do something differently than what was specified in the state legislation, AB 1890.  The last time this happened, in late 1999 (on ISO and PX governance), the state reared its back -- and FERC caved in.  So let's not be sanguine about what FERC has done here.  Much will need to be done by Enron and others to bolster FERC. THE COURTS:  The state could get its back up and decide to fight this.  The potential is that FERC will get political pressure to ""settle"", once a request for rehearing is submitted.  Remember --- this is ALL political. It's not about logic.  Last time, the state, through the Oversight Board, submitted a request for rehearing with FERC.  FERC told them to pound sand, so the EOB then filed in federal court to overturn the order.  This was ""settled"" when the state negotiated with FERC behind the scenes and FERC did a 180. (We have a court case pending on that order.)  If the state decides to go the rehearing route, I'm not too sure when they could initiate court action.  They could probably file for an emergency stay, but they tried that in the last court case and it was rejected. GOVERNOR:   A little has been trickling out.  Gov. Davis went to town at a press conference yesterday, talking about gouging generators and sending $6 billion out of state.  He stated his unhappiness with the FERC not providing refunds.  He says his adminstration will continue its fight to have refunds ordered. His administration will ""participate fully"" in the FERC hearing on Nov 9.  The Governor believes that the state lost control of its transmission system when it passed 1890.  So, I could conceive of some legislation or a federal push to ""give it back.""  I don't think that would be ultimately successful, but it would likely create some wild times. FEDERAL:  The press reported that U.S. Sen Feinstein will introduce a measure in the next few days to give FERC retroactive refund authority. STATE LEGISLATURE:     State Sen Bowen has said she plans to hold a hearing

Leave this to the UDCs -- we are also OK with the penalty.  The main problem for the ISO operators is the lack of resources being scheduled day-ahead, so I think we should be OK with that penalty. Mary Hain@ECT 11/03/2000 09:42 AM 
We have discovered another problem that we may want to discuss in our oral comments, although the UDCs may cover it.  Even though the FERC removes the forward market prohibition, the UDCs will not be in the forward market because: (1) the PUC may find they were imprudent and (2) the FERC's penalty is only for underscheduling load in the day-ahead or the day-of market, not for load failing to be hedged in the forward market.

Mark, Here's my shot.  I did it in Revision mode so you can see the changes.  Note that Enron never got out of the retail market in CA and has gathered about 1,000 MW of retail load -- we're bigger than all but two of the municipal utilities in the state.

Paul, We see what you refer to as "" the Cavanaugh/Edison bill"" as a re-play of AB 1421 from last year.  That bill will destroy the retail market.  We opposed 1421 and we'll oppose any son of 1421. We do not want to see it tied to any aggregation bill, the public goods charge extension or anything else. Sue Mara Paul Fenn <paulfenn@local.org> on 02/24/2000 07:03:12 PM 
Don, While the points you make are good ones, I think we should go for it this year. First, the Cavanaugh/Edison bill will in part restructure Chapter 854 regarding the role of the default provider, and Edison will be asking for a solidification of its distribution role, so this it is the natural vehicle to redress aggregation. If we wait until next year it may be too late, because we will be pushing rather than pulling. I think Edison and PG&E may put up less of a fight in this context. Second, while the League of Cities has not been involved, twelve cities and counties representing 2 million Californians passed a resolution last year asking the legislature for Community Choice. The leaders, from the Southern California Cities Joint Powers Consortium, San Francisco, Oakland, and Marin County, are actively involved in geting support from Bowen and Burton. Oakland is planning a statewide conference of cities and national leaders on Community Choice this Summer, which would coincide with committee hearings and attract media attention. In both Massachusetts and Ohio, we had weak support from the Leagues and did the job with about 35 municipalities represented. I am confident we will have that number in California this year. Third, TURN is providing strong support for the bill. I believe CALPIRG, UCAN and other consumer groups will give strong support as a result of the national coalition for Community Choice legislation, RAGE, which has signed most of them on the agenda over the past two years. Finally, the PUC is looking into Distribution Competition this year, and both the ORA and Strategic Planning are actively interested in Community Choice as a strategy for making the market work. As you described it, the legislation allows municipalities to implement Community Choice programs, and does not require it.

Here is WPTF's draft  with my additions.  It proposes going with Hebert's formula.   I added some language to have the starting point be $350 or higher.  All the Hoecker questions are answered -- I was fine with it.  And Dan has a section at the end describing CA as Regulatory Luddites -- I LOVED it! 
This looks really good -- I LOVED the Luddite Section!!! I took out a lot of the PX wonderfulness -- the PX can say that stuff in its own comments and we have no independent way to verify what they say. Also, I made a lot of changes to clarify or add thoughts.  Make sure the color graphics look OK in black and white. My only disappiontment -- was no talk about the retail market or how CA regulators should focus on that -- I added the thought in one spot. Because it is so long -- but still good-- I think a table of contents would really help-- so people see what is there and can flip to the relevant sections -- it also gets our full message across simply by looking at the headings. 
Bob Anderson of APSES developed these data.  They show that the utilities took unbelievably outrageous open positions in the market this summer. There are two possibilities: 1 they are incompetent (WRONG) or 2 they were OK from a corporate perspective (because of other long positions) and expected to receive regulatory relief.  Bob will write it up and add as testimony in an appendix -- Gary Ackerman likely witness. 
My brain is fried.  Can you remember what kind of opt in-out thing the CPUC had?  I remember it being a fiasco. 
Sue, Frank Rishe has ask me to search for the states that have allowed customers to opt in or out of marketing lists. Does California require utilities to offer a customer the opportunity to decide on who they want to market to them for energy services? If so did we take a position on it? Thank you so very much, Lynnette 
Congrats to Paul.  FERC approved the PGE/Sierra merger!!

I am OK with the language because of the use of the word ""appropriate"" before ""retail rate freezes"".  However, in discussing this with Steven, it seems as if IEP has not yet put some guidance around ""appropriate.""  I would like to do so,  I suggest that IEP support a rate freeze solely for small customers -- if necessary -- and a similar rate freeze or even a shorter-term rate freeze for larger customers only as a last resort.  Do we need a call to discuss this? ""Katie Kaplan"" <kaplan@iepa.com> 11/20/2000 07:20 PM Please respond to kaplan 
Language referenced: ""Stabilize prices and protect consumers against rate spikes - by directing utilities to diversify their energy supply ""portfolios"" with a prudent balance of short- and long-term power contracts, and by extending appropriate retail rate freezes until 2003. Greetings: Based on the responses we have received regarding the above language in the Seeing the Light and Power Up documents; a consensus has been reached, with one exception, to keep the language as it stands today and to continue to circulate the documents as printed, in order to respond in a timely manner to events such as the Governors press release. This approach will enable us to also respond to Senator Peace's press conference and another anticipated press conference by Governor Davis. There were several suggestions to rephrase the sentence in the future printing of documents in order to have more flexibility. We will continue to look at alternative language and will make a decision for the next printing. If there are any suggestions for language to replace this sentence please forward them to me no later than COB Wednesday November 22.  We will then circulate the new language for agreement. Thank you for your attention to this matter and please let me know if you have any questions. Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association (916) 448-9499

Union-Tribune Don't know- Does anyone know? 
I know that WPTF is supporting Hebert's approach and would suggest starting with $250 or higher with big increments every six months.  WPTF is also asking for clarification on what the cap applies to.  I don't recall what the comments said on refund and I haven't taken a look at the WPTF final yet. I'll let you know.  I'll check on the others today. James D Steffes 11/22/2000 07:30 AM 
As I've been thinking about our response today, I would like Enron to focus on making sure that the California (WSCC) markets are as good a possible for business over the next 15 to 24 months.  Following that idea, I think that the key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2) reducing the burden/risk of the prospective refund period. I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power / retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do much more on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can given the current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds become an issue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight this fight. I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bring these issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all of our other arguments. Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by quietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes?  Sue Mara, can you please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to file?  I want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not getting too soft. Jim

EES is concerned about the 95% requirement. What EES would like is to do is to ask FERC for a modification as follows: 1.  Change the requirement to 90%     OR 2.  Apply the 95% penalty solely to underscheduling of load (the draft order talks about it as a deviation, implying plus or minus, even though the section talks only about underscheduling of load) Also, EES would like some clarification that the rule applies to an entities' entire load. We can justify these modifications by pointing out that smaller scheduling cooridinators (i.e. smaller than the PX or IOUs) have less diverse loads and are more subject to on forseen swings -- so 95% is very difficult to achieve -- another disincentive to direct access and compeition. Time is marching on--

BAND WIDTH 
HERE are the good parts: CMUA asks FERC to order quick release of bid and other inf to the market participants; cites Australian rules, England & Wales, and Alberta -- Miracles do happen! Opposes 5% deviation band for underschedu;ing -- recommends a fixed band with a minimum of 2 MW for ""smaller"" SCs As an alternative -- asks for an 8% band. Does not address the pplication to generation. The bad parts: Thinks the Governor should appoint three of the Board members and the other three should be appointed by the WSCC Board of Trustees. (the ISO CEO makes the 7th) Wants the Board to report back after 2 years to see how RTOS might fit in in CA. Still wants to return to cost-of-service rates. Opposes opportunity costs as factor in evaluating bids above $250 Wants costs allocated properly -- in other words re-allocated away from the munis.

Sue, Mona, 1.  Tomorrow Martin Wenzel is speaking at a 1200 BOMA Luncheon at the Sheraton Palace Hotel at the Corner of Market and New Montgomery in San Francisco.  Martin was hoping that one of you might be available to attend. He thought that if you were not busy it might be valuable to have a government affairs expert available in case any tough regulatory questions came up.  If you are both busy I am sure we will get by.  We are currently trying to structure a new offering for their membership in the greater East Bay Area. 2.  Below is an excerpt from an e-mail I received from a customer.  My first inclination is that the customer is talking about the $65.00 rate cap in place in SDG&E and does not understand the implementation.  But this customer happens to be very savvy and is normally very involved in the regulatory environment.  Is there a new issue regarding some type of $65.00 rate cap that is being discussed for 2001 that is different from the current SDG&E proposal?  If so, what are the details.  As you can see below, depending on how it is implemented, it could be a problem.  My interpretation of the comments below is that this customer thinks a $65.00 rate cap is going to be put in place in 2001 and any charges above this cap are going to be shared by all rate payers equally. Therefore, it does them no good to lock in a higher price with an ESP if the market price is above $65.00.  I have a phone call in to the customer to get more details. ""We should talk about prices for next year, because it is my belief that UDC prices must be below $65.00 next year; any price above that mark should be

Yesterday, a number of parties to the Interruptible OII c.00-10-002) filed their proposals for what changes should be made to the utilities' interruptible programs.  A summary of those filings will be distributed later this week.  In addition the Energy Producers and Users Coalition filed an emergency motion yesterday to make certain ""refinements"" to the utilities' programs. Specifically, the motion requests that the Commission: 1. Order Edison and PG&E to implement Optional Binding Mandatory Curtailment (OBMC) programs for all distribution level customers.  The OBMC should provide flexible program criteria, recognizing that not all customers have the same operational capability to control the manner and extent of curtailment as envisioned by the Commission in directing the implementation of mandatory curtailment plans in D.91548; 2. Establish clear procedures by which customers who are not operationally suited to participate in the OBMC but who face some level of increased environmental damage, health or safety risk upon sudden curtailment may qualify under the ""Essential Use"" category of customers; and 3. Approve a new service alternative for customers that would experience a disproportionate business interruption and economic impact upon interruption. Let me know if you want to see a copy of the motion.

The following is an excerpt from a FERC order issued on Friday: ""Ridgewood Power LLC (Ridgewood) filed comments suggesting that the shortage of supply could be remedied in part by relaxing the operating efficiency and other regulatory requirements pertaining to Qualifying Facilities (QFs). Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 MW are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the remainder from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs). Ridgewood states that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is underutilized because of operating efficiency and other QF requirements. With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that these underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak and off-peak periods.  Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 MWs would be immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing utility or into the competitive market their ""above-baseline"" output for a limited time period.   Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency standards......... Section 292.205(c) of the Commission's regulations provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency standards ""upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy savings"".   However, the Commission has exercised its waiver authority in a number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill PURPA's goals.   We find that many of these same factors are present here. Consistent with the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver in this circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the Cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through increasing the availability of needed capacity.  Therefore, we will grant temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration QFs for sales into California, effective as of the date of this order.  We

The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a court tells them not to.  DO we care about this? Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC-- given the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info? Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC claims identify those who have abused market power. 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO Tariff section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly, the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20 unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4 which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in the past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an outage and projected in service date since this information could be used by Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current requests.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Edison International (EIX), saying the current state of California's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy, will call Wednesday for an end to California's four-year experiment with deregulation, sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires. John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, won't be able to recover more than $3 billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped. In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation, Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within 90 days and re-enter the power-generation business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law, the sources said. Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as 20%, the sources said, even though regulators rejected Edison's request for a rate increase of 10% last week. The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal, which would require action by the state legislature, the sources said. Southern California Edison, with 4.2 million customers, is one of the country's largest electric utilities. Edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and, as it says on its Web site, ""played a central role in the restructuring of the

Thanks for the feedback.  I hope you will be able to weigh in at the Tuesday meeting of IEP -- the position of IEP will be debated there.  Don't we want the trade association to be taking the tough positions for us? Out front and in public? richard_n_wheatley@reliantenergy.com 12/13/2000 12:38 PM 
Sue, Appreciated your stance on the conference call. We can't hide our heads in the sand at this point, as the governor will not let up and, despite his political intentions now or later, still enjoys taking shots at ostriches. Best regards.

The Dems are going for it! 
California Senator Feinstein, Governor Davis, Secretary of Energy Richardson, and FERC Commissioner Hoecker held a joint press conference related to the California energy problem.  They indicated a critical need for supply TODAY to serve the California marketplace.  Secretary Richardson indicated he will exercise his emergency power under the Federal Power Act [section 202(c)] to direct generation to California.  The Secretary indicated that DOE, under the FPA, will set a fair price for the power. IEP requests all its members to deliver as much generation as possible to California ASAP in order to avert potential shortages. In addition, the Governor and Senator Feinstein called for regionwide price caps and mandatory, reasonable long-term contracts between generators and the utilities.  They made the point that 4,000 - 5,000 MWs are being exported from the state, currently a lack of adequate planning and scheduling of resources/planned outages exists, and indicated that the CPUC would moved to implement forward contracting. IEP will forward the formal statement from the Press Conference (or a

I'll be on vacation Tuesday, but am reachable by phone. And, yes, my position is that I want trade associations taking a firm stance in cases such as we face in Calif. Having worked with many trade groups over the years, including API, IPAA, SGA, AGA and the various Mid-Continent O/G assns. as a lobbyist and from a public affairs standpoint, know a weak assn. does one no good in the long run. It's imperative that the stronger members drive the process. Unfortunately, arriving at consensus is far from easy, and many trade groups would rather let the individual companies get out front because the assn. can't reach consensus among its wishy-washy members. We've had to do that somewhat in Calif. and have been working very hard with selected media on our own to educate them since the issue arose in the summer. Believe we are making headway, but can't let up now. RW

In lay speak, the new alternative decision looks like it could lead to a very quick end to the rate freeze and the associated PX Credit.  Roger's suggesting sometime in the 1st Quarter 2001 
The CPUC Meeting agenda changed the following item to read as follow: A99-01-016 - Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). For authority to establish post-transition period electric ratemaking mechanisms. A.99-01-019, A.99-01-034, A.99-02-029, A.00-10-028 - Related matters. This decision addresses the extraordinary financial situation facing PG&E and Edison as a result of current problems in the wholesale electric market and includes an assessment of accounting changes and adjustments previously proposed in this proceeding. Simultaneously, the Commission will expedite its review of market valuation proceedings to determine the feasibility of lifting the rate freeze as expeditiously as possible, and to evaluate the need for reasonable rate increases. Previously, this item read as follows: ""The decision denies the emergency petitions to modify D99-10-057 and D..... filed by PG&E and SCE on October 4, 2000. The decision adopts the accounting changes proposed by TURN as a first step in assessing the impacts of electric restructuing on cost recovery.The Commission will continue to monitor the impact on the utilities in future phases of this proceeding or successor

Sue Mara (415) 782-7802 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CPUC SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS -- TAKE ACTION What Did the CPUC Do:   The CPUC voted at its meeting on September 20, 2001 to suspend direct access immediate. Included in the order is reference to a subsequent order that would address additional issues. The order also put everyone ""on notice"" that the Commission could modify the order later to suspend direct access retroactively to July 1, 2001. What Action is Required:  Many believe that the CPUC did not have valid reasons for suspending direct access and has no right to abrogate contracts retroctively, as it has threatened.  Consequently, concerned customers and energy service providers are preparing a Request for Rehearing that must be filed with the CPUC by Friday, September 28, 2001.  The Legislature enacted a special statute governing this and related decisions.  This first step is required by that statute.  If the CPUC denies the request (as expected), the next step would be a direct appeal to the State Supreme Court, which is also required by that same statute. What Will The Request for Rehearing Include:  A Request for Rehearing must raise the errors of law made by the CPUC in its order. The attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM) has prepared a draft. The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. The Decision's purported findings are not supported. The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding. What Can You Do:  Sign on to the Request for Rehearing and contact your elected state representatives to let them know that direct access must be reinstated. 
Jeff asked that I send this to you.  THIS MUST BE FILED BY FRIDAY.  We're trying to get as many parties as possible to join with us. Love to have you with us. Here is the first draft. 
As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.  Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.  We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.  Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers. Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.  The attorneys are preparing a pro-forma declaration that each party can use to prepare their own. I will e-mail that as soon as I have it. The draft court case is attached.  It will form the basis for our CPUC filing. We would expect the CPUC to ignore the filing.  If the Commission failed to act on our request by the next regularly scheduled meeting, we would file in court immediately. We would use the same declarations and much of the same filing info in the court case. To the extent we have customers on our filings, we have a much better shot at winning. I have gotten agreements form a number of other ESPs who will join with us.  They are: APSES, Strategic Energy, AES/New Energy, American Utility Network, and perhaps Commonwealth. Each of these, in turn, is working to get some of their customers to sign on. I am working with UC's attorney to see if they will join. Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor. Some of our ESP and customer friends would likely drop off at that point, because they have less financial harm from an Aug 25 date. If you have customers intersted in signing on, please let me know.  The customer may contact me or the attorneys directly.

Just to alert you.  The new CPUC proposed decision to suspend DA to be voted on next week has some language of concern and I wanted you to be aware of it  This new language, which was circulated today, implies some retroactive action by the CPUC -- but not on the suspension issue.  So, some financial risk is possible.  The language follows.  We will endeavor to get the language removed (long-shot) or clarified (also long-shot).

Jim and Jeff, I spent 20 minutes trying to open Jeff's excell attachment.  I could not. Jeff did not incorporate my notes into his.  SO, Jim I guess you'll just have to go with the two pieces you got from us. 
On October 2, I, Aaron Klem and our outside attorney, Jeanne Bennett, met with other ESPs, the utilities, and the Energy Division staff of the CPUC to hammer out an agreement on implementing the CPUC's order suspending direct access (DA) and handling continued submission of DASRs. It was news to the utilities that ESPs have many contracts --  most several years old -- that allow for addition and subtraction of facilities throughout the contract term.  The utilities had thought that cutting off DASRs would be the best way to enforce the CPUC's order without having to review contracts (which they don't want to do). After much discussion and debate, the participants agreed to make a joint filing at the CPUC seeking quick action. Most agreed on the following plan (with the CPUC staff to check on the appropriate procedural vehicle): We will endeavor to reach agreement on a joint filing at the CPUC to modify Rule 22 (the rule that governs CPUC/ESP interactions) (a Petition to Modify was also discussed as a vehicle) - a small working group of attorneys has been set up to draft this.  The group includes Jeanne Bennett and Dian Grueneich, who represents UC/CSU. The new Rule 22 will add a section that acknowledges the CPUC action and sets forth therein (or in an Appendix) a verification procedure. Each ESP will submit a list of customers by this Friday, October 5, for ALL contracts -- existing and new -- to each utility. It will be diificult and perhaps impossible to add customers later, so be complete. Each ESP will submit to each utility the account level information for each customer on the list by November 1. All customer accounts should be on this list including facilities that have not yet been switched to DA, but may be switched sometime in the future.  Also, to the extent customers have plans for new facilities, put them on the list -- even if we do not yet have account information. Anyone who has the right to add DA later needs to be on the list. Any DASR submitted for an account on the November 1 list will be accepted by the utilities -- no matter when it is submitted. Additional accounts not on the November 1 list can be added through a verification process, such as an affidavit submitted by the ESP or by both the ESP and the customer.  This process is being worked out by the attorney working group. The CPUC will be asked to approve this approach quickly. There is risk that the CPUC will NOT approve the approach and will cutoff DASRs on some date certain, in which case legal action would be required to allow for futher submission of DASRs. Steve Roskow of CPUC Energy Division said the CPUC has two factions -- one wants to cut off DA and the other wants it to continue.  He could not guarantee how the CPUC will respond to the joint approach.  He also mentioned that there are many lawyers at the CPUC looking at the retoactivity issue and the Commission's ability to affect existing contracts. Several participants, including Enron, UC/CSU and APSES, made strong statements about the legal problems the CPUC would face if they go down that road. The utilities will be making a filing at the CPUC tomorrow that describes the steps they have taken to enforce the order.  PG&E and SDG&E will discuss the meeting and the joint plan -- PG&E may also say it will stick with some DASR cutoff date unless it hears otherwise from the CPUC.  SCE did not attend the meeting in person and at the end made clear that they had not agreed with the joint plan.  SCE is sticking with its original plan -- a customer and account list by September 24 and a DASR cutoff of October 20, no DASR accepted unless the name is on the customer list. The Energy Division staff is trying to move SCE off this position but I believe it comes from ""on high.""  We'll take our own run at it through a higher level at SCE. For now, we should continue to submit DASRs and follow the proposed joint plan and just keep records of our interactions with SCE (and the other utilities as well). If the situation does not improve in the next few days, we will reassess. There is also the risk that the CPUC will not act on the joint approach quickly, leaving these issues in limbo and the utilities assuming ""risk"" that they have done the wrong thing and will be ""punished."" Not surprisingly, the utilities seem to favor a drop dead date for DASR submission, as a way to minimize this risk.  During the course of the meeting, the utilities mentioned a ""compromise"" of January 1, 2002 for a DASR cutff date.  They thought this would give the CPUC time to act on the joint plan, but allow them to minimize their risk in the event the CPUC decides that the utilities should have cutoff DASRs from the beginning.  This notion may appear in the filings to be made tomorrow.  I told them that any drop-dead date for DASR submission would be unacceptable to Enron. UC/CSU said the same.  A few ESPs seemed ready to accept the 1/1/02 cutoff but most do not. Call with any questions. Sue Mara (415) 782-7802 
We got the first draft of Ben Zycher's abstract on the politics and economics of the CA energy problems.  (The paper is scheduled to be released in late Sept.) I had pushed for an abstract to be released in August in time to help forstall bad things on direct access.  Here is the draft abstract which is exceeding turgid. I highlighted some key direct access statements. It has some good things to say about DA mixed in with all the econobabble. I have pressed upon the Pacific Research Institute the need to get some media hype on this -- starting no later than Monday.  Gary Ackerman (650) 324-3250 is taking the lead in working with PRI.  I suggested a press release attaching the abstract.  I asked Gary to work with Jeff and Karen in my absence. 
I assume you're all over this, Linda. 
surcharge from PG&E 
As we discussed in our special call last week, I asked Brian Cragg from Goodin McBride to look into the issue of what, if anything, the CPUC can do in lieu of suspending direct access. ABX 1 says the CPUC ""shall suspend"" DA, but does not give any time line for doing so, nor any criterita to use in making the determination to suspend it.  This gives the CPUC ample ability to delay suspending DA, especially while bills affecting DA are in play in Sacramento. The President could have her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying the suspension.  Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in place -- although he said it was a ""stretch.""  Brian said she could, for example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of implementing ABX 1.  He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however, stretching the concept a bit too far.  Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law. She could also institute an ""open season"" through some defined date, such as Jan 1, 2002, and suspend DA thereafter. She could take this action subject to the passage of superceding legislation -- which, of course, could either kill DA altogether or implement some combination of exit fee/DAopen season/DA limitation. Let's discuss strategy on our next call. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802

The workshop conducted by the Energy Division on Friday on the DWR revenue requirement submitted to the Commission on July  23rd was basically a question and answer session. A representative of DWR was present as were several representatives of the consulting firm Navigant which assisted DWR in constructing its revenue requirement request.  The representatives of Navigant fielded most of the questions. Not much new information was garnered.  A little more clarity was shed on certain areas. Of interest to Enron would be that in determining the net short for each of the UDCs for which DWR was purchasing it assumed no change in the current direct access levels (which is approximately 2% of the load in the state) through 2002. Other points of clarification included: (1) A question exists with respect to whether DWR is responsible for the ISO costs billed to the UDCs for the period of January through June of 2001. (2) Any payments which were made to DWR to date by the UDCs would be netted against the revenue requirements requests for the first and second quarter of this year.  PG&E indicated that DWR's numbers for the revenue received from PG&E to date do not match its own accounting. (3) The net short calculation for each UDC was derived by using the net short forecasts provided by each of the UDCs an modifying them to take into account (1) a 4% reduction in load due to conservation efforts; (2) a 2% reduction in load due to price elasticity increasing to 3% by January 2001; (3) estimated impacts of the 20/20 program (assuming also a similar program for next summer); (4) the impact of the UDCs curtailment programs.  Once again, PG&E indicated its belief that DWR's net short projection for PG&E was erroneous. (4)  DWR explained that the basis for the projection that they would need 1.65 cents out of the three cents rate increase was that for sales made by DWR they already receive the UDC generation rate (i.e., approximately 6.8 cent for PG&E and 7.2 cent for SCE).  On top of that, they need the 1.65 cents. SCE submitted four pages of written questions to DWR on their revenue request.  DWR is to respond in writing (and serve on all people on the service list ) by Tuesday the 31st.  To the extent that the questions are applicable to PG&E, they will answer the question with respect to both UDCs. Please call if you have any questions. Jeanne Bennett

Attached for your information is a copy of the Petition for Modification of= D.01-05-064 which ABAG POWER filed on July 13.  On behalf of ABAG, I woul= d  like to solicit your support of this petition.  The decision in question= is  the Commission's May 15 decision where it approved the rate design for= the  three-cent rate increase. =20 =20 You may recall that the decision approved a 12-month surcharge for all  bun= dled service customers to make up for the revenue which PG&E and SCE did  n= ot recover during the interim period between the March 27 issuance of  D.01= -03-082 and the subsequent issuance of the May 15 decision.  You also  know= that the May decision provided specifically that DA customers were NOT to = be subject to the rate increase.=20 =20 The ABAG petition for modification seeks to have the Commission clarify  th= at DA customers who received DA service during the interim period between t= he  two decisions should not be subject to the one-year sucharge, even if t= hey were  subsequently returned to bundled service.  The arguments supporti= ng this  position are as follows: Direct  access customers were specifically exempted from the procurement-re= lated rate  increase because they do not receive procurement service.  They= should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month procurement surch= arge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled service.  =20 The inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit= have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under signific= ant financial stress.  The Member public agencies have  suffered extreme fi= nancial hardship.   The application of the 12-month procurement surcharge h= as added to that  burden unnecessarily. In a separate  proceeding (draft Resolution E-3726),  the Commission has ex= pressed  its intent to ""guard against inequities"" for direct access custome= rs of  SDG&E.  ABAG POWER asks simply  that the Commission afford similar p= rotection to the direct access customers  of PG&E who did not receive bundl= ed procurement service during the  interval between the March and May Decis= ions. =20 Moreover, in addition  to being inequitable, the application of the procure= ment surcharge to  non-procurement direct access customers would be discrim= inatory and would  cause the utilities to violate the anti-discrimination p= rovisions of the  Public Utilities Code, Sections 453(a) and 453(c). ABAG POWER  would very much appreciate the support of ESPs and other market= participants at  the Commission.  Under Rule 47(f) of the Commission's Rul= es of Practice and  Procedure, ""Responses to petitions for modification mus= t be filed and served  within 30 days of the date that the petition was ser= ved, unless the  administrative law judge sets a different date. Responses = must be served on the  petitioner and on all  parties who were served with = the petition and must  comply with the requirements of Rules 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2= .3, and 2.5.""  Filings  sooner than that would be appreciated.  Please give= me a call or email if  you are willing to file in support of the ABAG peti= tion.

Got the PUC to delay votes threatening to suspend, or end, Direct Access in California. Got Senators Dunn and Burton to agree to postpone vote on Senator Dunn's report recommending that the full Sentate vote to 1) find Enron in contempt and 2) impose steep fines pending compliance by Enron. Got the PUC to postpone a vote which would have 1) amended the way California applies the ""PX Credit"" and 2) harmed EES' financial position. Provided the California Assembly Speaker with analysis supporting a core/noncore electricity market structure in California, which the Speaker then embraced as his own and established a working group in an attempt to implement the proposal in California. Helped reach an agreement with Edison to delay a PUC proceeding in which the Administrative Law Judge could have forced Enron to submit commercially sensitive information. Helped get California policymakers to agree to 1) raise prices in order to return the IOUs to creditworthiness; 2) establish a ""demand buy-down"" proposal; 3) focus on the need to expedite plant siting and construction; and 4) enter into long-term contracts to reduce exposure to price volatility. Worked with PR and Ken Lay to persuade California's business leaders to get involved in the effort to resolve California's energy crisis.

Here's a little more detail on the issues that FERC wants to explore with regard to the Transwestern negotiated deals: NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : July 26, 2001 FERC Targets Transwestern for Market-Power Hearing FERC called for a hearing to determine whether Transwestern Pipeline exercised market power when it awarded negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged up to $27/MMBtu last February, when the firm transportation rate to the California border was only 38 cents/MMBtu. That was ""70 times the recourse rate,"" said Commissioner Linda Breathitt, who called the matter up for discussion at the Commission's regular meeting. ""Thirty-eight cents versus $27, that's a big difference in prices and we ought to be looking at that,"" responded Commissioner William Massey. ""...[W]e believe closer scrutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary, especially in light of our serious concern regarding the high prices for natural gas in California relative to prices in the rest of the country and their consequential effect on wholesale electricity prices in California,"" the order noted [RP97-288-009]. FERC's action was in response to a show cause order it issued in March, directing Transwestern to explain how it had firm capacity available on its pipeline to move gas under the negotiated-rate transactions, and why its actions in entering into the negotiated-rate agreements didn't violate Commission regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiated-rate agreements.

All: The word from the Assembly is that there will be amendments to SB 78, which will be the vehicle addressing the Edison bailout, on Thursday, a hearing on Friday and Floor Session to follow to ratify whatever comes out of committee.  This word comes out of the Assembly energy committee (Joe Lyons) and although Rick Simpson was with the Speaker all afternoon and didn't get back to me, numerous other Members' offices confirmed that they have been told to be in town and available Friday. There is another working group, but I do not know who is on it, nor were we invited.  I will continue to advocate for the language we were able to get into 82, as should your individual lobbyists.

I don't agree Edison's premise -- that ""direct access customers contributed= just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as bundled service= customers."" We need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric. Here's my reasoning. DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to bu= y power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA customers.= SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high = wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for = the undercollection. I can make the argument that the undercollection is SO= LELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE. There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.  I w= ill explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments= of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any co= mpetitive retail market until their costs were paid off.  One of the tradeo= ffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WH= OLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or = bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their bill= ions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk they agreed to.  Now, they ar= e claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more.  This is in dire= ct conflict with the statute. I can make the argument that the statute requ= ires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs al= one -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject= 
As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.  Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.  We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.  Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers. Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.  The attorneys are preparing a pro-forma declaration that each party can use to prepare their own. I will e-mail that as soon as I have it. The draft court case is attached.  It will form the basis for our CPUC filing. We would expect the CPUC to ignore the filing.  If the Commission failed to act on our request by the next regularly scheduled meeting, we would file in court immediately. We would use the same declarations and much of the same filing info in the court case. To the extent we have customers on our filings, we have a much better shot at winning. I have gotten agreements form a number of other ESPs who will join with us.  They are: APSES, Strategic Energy, AES/New Energy, American Utility Network, and perhaps Commonwealth. Each of these, in turn, is working to get some of their customers to sign on. I am working with UC's attorney to see if they will join. Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor. Some of our ESP and customer friends would likely drop off at that point, because they have less financial harm from an Aug 25 date. If you have customers intersted in signing on, please let me know.  The customer may contact me or the attorneys directly.

I've been talking to other ESPs about the PX Credit Payment and the Barnett proceeding.  Some tidbits: New West -- wants to keep the payment issues out of the proceeding and wil attempt to do that.  They don't have a complaint filed, so they need SCE to have good faith bilateral settlement discussions.  Good luck there.  Their meeting with SCE is 11/6. New Energy -- New Energy returned all customers (but one) before May 2000. The one customer -- Krogers (grocery store chain) -- has been very active at the Legislature on this and will attend the SCE meeting. No meeting has been set up but one is expected next week. Has been more willing to talk about ""cost shifting"" but thinks SCE's proposal is ludicrous. I suggested it would be a bad idea to go down SCE's cost shifting road right now. Is outraged by SCE's proposal. APSES --  Is outraged by SCE's proposal. Told SCE he wouldn't meet until SCE gives him the proposed payment amount and substantiation for it. He believes that SCE has no way to determne an accurate number.  He will also insist that SCE true-up the amount, once the ISO hits the utilities with the underscheduling penalty.  And finally, he will insist that SCE complete the PX Credit audit before he'll agree to a number.  APSES is the other party with a complaint filed at the Commission. His new contracts put his customers at risk for changes to the PX Credit mechanism, so his issue is primarily collecting the past amount due. Strategic Energy -- Only does business in San Diego. Commonwealth -- Minimal exposure.

New West has indeed adopted SCE's position hook-line-and-sinker.  I left Janie a very pointed e-mail on this topic.  They have no customers receiving commodity from them, so, I guess, in the short term, they are not harmed.  It is, noehteless, an unprincipled position.  A key quote from the filing: 
Of The Prepared Direct Testimony Of William Marcus On Behalf Of TURN 
Guys, At the Board meeting yesterday, WPTF agreed to consider being involved in the utility procurement case.  AReM is also reviewing its participation as is IEP.  IEP should play a major role -- they have serious concerns that the CPUC will attempt to reinstate integrated resource planning and the evil BRPU.  WPTF will have its attorney review the utility filings due on November 21, and prepare summary comments for WPTF as a starting point for detrrmining the WPTF position. The board agreed to hold a teleconference on November 28 to decide on its position.  With all these groups involved, I think Enron will be able to coordinate its issues through them and avoid being in the case separately. 
Jeff, Jim and I spoke today about having Enron participate separately in this proceeding -- responding to the utilities' plans to be filed today. I believe that AReM will take a strong position and will incorporate any comments we have.  I don't see anything we can gain by paying for a separate filing under Enron's name.  Jim agreed.  Jim asked that you call him if you have major concerns with this approach. 
Jeff Dasovich may be there for Enron on Monday. Here are some of my thoughts. # 1 Objective -- Get DA Reinstated #2 Objective -- Ensure fair fees and rules We have our Supreme Court appeal and we need a legislative/administration strategy to put pressure on for re-instatement.  None of us underestimates the difficulty of this in an election year.  Speaking of elections, we may also want to contact the Riordan campaign.  He came out with some good messages on energy but did not say a peep about retail competition. To the extent we can make it an issue in the campaign, it gets more visibility. We should also consider pushing on John White and company to make green DA a reality.  Some DA is better than none. The fee and rules issue is going to be a grind and likely at the CPUC. As I've said, it's been hand-to-hand combat with the utilities since 9-20-01. I would like to find a way to work better with the customer groups, because in the end, they are the ones who can carry the day.  Nobody really wants to listen to a bunch of ESPs. The problem is that no one really cares as much as we do -- it's our business afterall. I can't make any promises about Enron or Enron/Dynegy continuing in AReM and I can't predict if/when we might bow out. I think AReM is going to have to pick its spots this year and minimize its expenses whatever it does.  Unfortunately, our experience at the CPUC has been bad.  That would argue for a minimum of activity in the cases and a maximum of lobbying at the Commission and the Leg/Admin. We have to remember that we get all excited about these cases and the issues only to be ignored or harmed when decisions are reached -- especially with certain ALJs. Davis can still get another appointee and things will look even bleaker then. This may sound depressing, but that's reality.  We are the ones carrying on the good fight and the fight must continue. Have a good meeting.  Aloha. 
Phyllis, Since you're Ms. Aggregation now -- thought you'd want to see this. This bill passed out of the Legislature and has gone to the Governor to sign. Call with questions! Sue 
BILL -- NEW SPECIAL SESSION 
pro	cess 
Jeff asked that I send this to you.  THIS MUST BE FILED BY FRIDAY.  We're trying to get as many parties as possible to join with us. Love to have you with us. Here is the first draft. 
Here is a one pager you can use with customers.  I also attach the draft filing -- Bob Williams and Mike Smith and I are meeting this afternoon (4 pm ) Houston time to see if there are any EES legal issues with it -- so don't release the full draft until you hear from me. Sue Mara (415) 782-7802 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CPUC SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS -- TAKE ACTION What Did the CPUC Do:   The CPUC voted at its meeting on September 20, 2001 to suspend direct access immediate. Included in the order is reference to a subsequent order that would address additional issues. The order also put everyone ""on notice"" that the Commission could modify the order later to suspend direct access retroactively to July 1, 2001. What Action is Required:  Many believe that the CPUC did not have valid reasons for suspending direct access and has no right to abrogate contracts retroctively, as it has threatened.  Consequently, concerned customers and energy service providers are preparing a Request for Rehearing that must be filed with the CPUC by Friday, September 28, 2001.  The Legislature enacted a special statute governing this and related decisions.  This first step is required by that statute.  If the CPUC denies the request (as expected), the next step would be a direct appeal to the State Supreme Court, which is also required by that same statute. What Will The Request for Rehearing Include:  A Request for Rehearing must raise the errors of law made by the CPUC in its order. The attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM) has prepared a draft. The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. The Decision's purported findings are not supported. The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding. What Can You Do:  Sign on to the Request for Rehearing and contact your elected state representatives to let them know that direct access must be reinstated. 
Haven't heard back from anyone except Mark. Deadline TOMORROW We have several associations who agreed to sign on so far -- Thanks, Jeff!! -- CA Chamber CA Retailers Assoc CA League of Food Processors SPURR-REMAC (schools in northern CA) We still need some individual customers. UC/CSU will send its own rehearing request separately Sue Mara 
mongering? 
The new data are out from the CPUC.  Only reported as of 8/31/01. 
On October 2, I, Aaron Klem and our outside attorney, Jeanne Bennett, met with other ESPs, the utilities, and the Energy Division staff of the CPUC to hammer out an agreement on implementing the CPUC's order suspending direct access (DA) and handling continued submission of DASRs. It was news to the utilities that ESPs have many contracts --  most several years old -- that allow for addition and subtraction of facilities throughout the contract term.  The utilities had thought that cutting off DASRs would be the best way to enforce the CPUC's order without having to review contracts (which they don't want to do). After much discussion and debate, the participants agreed to make a joint filing at the CPUC seeking quick action. Most agreed on the following plan (with the CPUC staff to check on the appropriate procedural vehicle): We will endeavor to reach agreement on a joint filing at the CPUC to modify Rule 22 (the rule that governs CPUC/ESP interactions) (a Petition to Modify was also discussed as a vehicle) - a small working group of attorneys has been set up to draft this.  The group includes Jeanne Bennett and Dian Grueneich, who represents UC/CSU. The new Rule 22 will add a section that acknowledges the CPUC action and sets forth therein (or in an Appendix) a verification procedure. Each ESP will submit a list of customers by this Friday, October 5, for ALL contracts -- existing and new -- to each utility. It will be diificult and perhaps impossible to add customers later, so be complete. Each ESP will submit to each utility the account level information for each customer on the list by November 1. All customer accounts should be on this list including facilities that have not yet been switched to DA, but may be switched sometime in the future.  Also, to the extent customers have plans for new facilities, put them on the list -- even if we do not yet have account information. Anyone who has the right to add DA later needs to be on the list. Any DASR submitted for an account on the November 1 list will be accepted by the utilities -- no matter when it is submitted. Additional accounts not on the November 1 list can be added through a verification process, such as an affidavit submitted by the ESP or by both the ESP and the customer.  This process is being worked out by the attorney working group. The CPUC will be asked to approve this approach quickly. There is risk that the CPUC will NOT approve the approach and will cutoff DASRs on some date certain, in which case legal action would be required to allow for futher submission of DASRs. Steve Roskow of CPUC Energy Division said the CPUC has two factions -- one wants to cut off DA and the other wants it to continue.  He could not guarantee how the CPUC will respond to the joint approach.  He also mentioned that there are many lawyers at the CPUC looking at the retoactivity issue and the Commission's ability to affect existing contracts. Several participants, including Enron, UC/CSU and APSES, made strong statements about the legal problems the CPUC would face if they go down that road. The utilities will be making a filing at the CPUC tomorrow that describes the steps they have taken to enforce the order.  PG&E and SDG&E will discuss the meeting and the joint plan -- PG&E may also say it will stick with some DASR cutoff date unless it hears otherwise from the CPUC.  SCE did not attend the meeting in person and at the end made clear that they had not agreed with the joint plan.  SCE is sticking with its original plan -- a customer and account list by September 24 and a DASR cutoff of October 20, no DASR accepted unless the name is on the customer list. The Energy Division staff is trying to move SCE off this position but I believe it comes from ""on high.""  We'll take our own run at it through a higher level at SCE. For now, we should continue to submit DASRs and follow the proposed joint plan and just keep records of our interactions with SCE (and the other utilities as well). If the situation does not improve in the next few days, we will reassess. There is also the risk that the CPUC will not act on the joint approach quickly, leaving these issues in limbo and the utilities assuming ""risk"" that they have done the wrong thing and will be ""punished."" Not surprisingly, the utilities seem to favor a drop dead date for DASR submission, as a way to minimize this risk.  During the course of the meeting, the utilities mentioned a ""compromise"" of January 1, 2002 for a DASR cutff date.  They thought this would give the CPUC time to act on the joint plan, but allow them to minimize their risk in the event the CPUC decides that the utilities should have cutoff DASRs from the beginning.  This notion may appear in the filings to be made tomorrow.  I told them that any drop-dead date for DASR submission would be unacceptable to Enron. UC/CSU said the same.  A few ESPs seemed ready to accept the 1/1/02 cutoff but most do not. Call with any questions. Sue Mara (415) 782-7802 
Invoices 
Jim and Jeff, I spent 20 minutes trying to open Jeff's excell attachment.  I could not. Jeff did not incorporate my notes into his.  SO, Jim I guess you'll just have to go with the two pieces you got from us. 
Just to alert you.  The new CPUC proposed decision to suspend DA to be voted on next week has some language of concern and I wanted you to be aware of it  This new language, which was circulated today, implies some retroactive action by the CPUC -- but not on the suspension issue.  So, some financial risk is possible.  The language follows.  We will endeavor to get the language removed (long-shot) or clarified (also long-shot).

Here it is 
Commissioner Wood has issued extensive questions on direct access, continuing his harassment of ESPs.  He raises the issues of moving the termination date back from September 20 and supposed cost shifting.  He also asks for copies of contracts with customers and extensive information about those contracts. Comments are due Nov 2 with replies due Nov 8.  We plan to respond aggressively through our coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM). We WILL NOT be providing any contract information. 
Sorry.  Here it is 
I spoke with SDG&E's attorney on the question of why we received no notice on the switch of our customers to duel billing.  He told me that SDG&E did not believe notice was required under the tariff.  The link below is the ESP tariff, called Rule 25 for SDG&E. I also asked how it would be implemented.  The letter says the switch is effective 2 pm today.  He was not clear but it appears switches will take place on the billing date for each customer.  He did not know whether the switches will all be prospective or if they plan to go back to the last bill date.  I expressed surprise with the notion that they could go back in time.  He said he would have someone call me who is more knowledgable on the details. 
Questions in Assigned Commissioner Wood's Ruling of October 23, 2001 
Paul, We see what you refer to as "" the Cavanaugh/Edison bill"" as a re-play of AB 1421 from last year.  That bill will destroy the retail market.  We opposed 1421 and we'll oppose any son of 1421. We do not want to see it tied to any aggregation bill, the public goods charge extension or anything else. Sue Mara Paul Fenn <paulfenn@local.org> on 02/24/2000 07:03:12 PM 
Don, While the points you make are good ones, I think we should go for it this year. First, the Cavanaugh/Edison bill will in part restructure Chapter 854 regarding the role of the default provider, and Edison will be asking for a solidification of its distribution role, so this it is the natural vehicle to redress aggregation. If we wait until next year it may be too late, because we will be pushing rather than pulling. I think Edison and PG&E may put up less of a fight in this context. Second, while the League of Cities has not been involved, twelve cities and counties representing 2 million Californians passed a resolution last year asking the legislature for Community Choice. The leaders, from the Southern California Cities Joint Powers Consortium, San Francisco, Oakland, and Marin County, are actively involved in geting support from Bowen and Burton. Oakland is planning a statewide conference of cities and national leaders on Community Choice this Summer, which would coincide with committee hearings and attract media attention. In both Massachusetts and Ohio, we had weak support from the Leagues and did the job with about 35 municipalities represented. I am confident we will have that number in California this year. Third, TURN is providing strong support for the bill. I believe CALPIRG, UCAN and other consumer groups will give strong support as a result of the national coalition for Community Choice legislation, RAGE, which has signed most of them on the agenda over the past two years. Finally, the PUC is looking into Distribution Competition this year, and both the ORA and Strategic Planning are actively interested in Community Choice as a strategy for making the market work. As you described it, the legislation allows municipalities to implement Community Choice programs, and does not require it.

Here it is.  To explain, I left the sheet you saw previously as Sheet 1. Sheet 2 is the new employee and business expense budget.  It shows expenditures through 7/09/01 in the first column, our 2001 budget in the second column, and a proposed 2002 budget in the third column.  Some of the expenditures are kind of kooky -- because of miscoding or other reasons.  For example, payments to IEP appear under ""Employee Pers --Other"" and ""Outside Serv - Prof"".  There are many examples of kooky things -- so don't worry about it. We ended up getting charged for things this year that we didn't put in our budget, such as AT&T calling cards and Edith's time -- so I've tried to include all the items -- even if I put them in another category (for example, I don't use the category ""EIS Allocation"" in our budget). I included those wacky categories that we don't use in our budget at the bottom of column 1 just to get the correct total for the year to date. Sheet 3 is outside expenses such as contributions, retainers and memberships.  Column 1 shows our 2001 budget and column 3 shows our projected 2002 budget. I added some dollars to the retainers to cover some minimal expenses that we get charged.  Other than that, it's pretty much what we discussed last week. Have fun, Paul!  Call with any questions.

California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity Gouger Gray Davis California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required 
As we discussed in our special call last week, I asked Brian Cragg from Goodin McBride to look into the issue of what, if anything, the CPUC can do in lieu of suspending direct access. ABX 1 says the CPUC ""shall suspend"" DA, but does not give any time line for doing so, nor any criterita to use in making the determination to suspend it.  This gives the CPUC ample ability to delay suspending DA, especially while bills affecting DA are in play in Sacramento. The President could have her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying the suspension.  Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in place -- although he said it was a ""stretch.""  Brian said she could, for example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of implementing ABX 1.  He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however, stretching the concept a bit too far.  Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law. She could also institute an ""open season"" through some defined date, such as Jan 1, 2002, and suspend DA thereafter. She could take this action subject to the passage of superceding legislation -- which, of course, could either kill DA altogether or implement some combination of exit fee/DAopen season/DA limitation. Let's discuss strategy on our next call. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802

Dear All, Attached is this week's legislative report for IEP. Despite the summer break, leaders in the Assembly planned to call back their side of the Legislature to debate and vote on a ""rescue"" plan for Southern California Edison. The new effort was outlined in our Tuesday fax to each of you.  In short, the new plan called for amending SB 78xx and AB 82xx to, among other things, provide for a dedicated rate component to support a $2.9 billion bond financing by Edison, but would have prevented Edison from using the funds to pay generators, PX and ISO invoices, directly or indirectly. The $2.9 billion could be used to pay QFs.  The dedicated rate component for repayment of the bonds would apply to all consumers for two years, and then apply solely to non-core customers.  Additionally, under the plan, the 30% haircut/trust account concept was deleted, the decision on a transmission line purchase was deferred to settlement discussions between the state and Edison, the RPS targeted a 10% growth in new generating capacity through 2010, and direct access would be permitted under certain circumstances effective no earlier than January 1, 2002.  The Assembly leadership planned on holding an informational meeting on the new plan on Thursday, July 26 and committee and floor votes on the plan today, Friday, July 27.  However, the leadership could not garner enough votes for this new plan this week, so no informational hearing was held, nor will any votes be held today.  Even if this new plan had been approved by the Assembly this week, Senator Burton's office made it very clear that Senator Burton had no intention of bringing his house back in to session to vote on the measure.  Accordingly, barring the governor calling the legislature back into session, we do not expect any other activity on this new plan before the legislature reconvenes on August 20, and perhaps not then either. Other events this week include: * In Thursday's Los Angeles Times, S. David Freeman -- Governor Davis' primary negotiator on the long-term contract deals -- authored an editorial arguing that the state's long-term energy contracts were a primary factor in the recent reduction in energy prices on the spot market.  You can find the article at www.latimes.com.  It ran on the editorial page on Thursday, July 26. * It is our understanding that on Thursday Senator Byron Sher had draft amendments prepared by his staff to amend SB 532 to address Renewable Portfolio Standards issues.  The amendments are not yet public, but we are hopeful that we will be able to obtain them when his staff returns next week.  We will keep you apprised. * FERC ordered hearings on Wednesday to determine how much money electric generators owe California for wholesale power overcharges.  With California still insisting that it is owed $8.9 billion by generators, the expected FERC decision on the refund amount is certain to fall short of the state's expectations.  Lawsuits are expected to follow issuance of the decision.  In a press statement earlier this week, the governor stated his hopes that California will receive all $8.9 billion adding, ""As for the energy profiteers and pirates, let me make clear that I will not rest until every dollar gouged from California businesses and residents returns to California. If the FERC does not make California whole, we will see you in

Enron Individuals The workshop conducted by the Energy Division on Friday on the DWR revenue requirement submitted to the Commission on July  23rd was basically a question and answer session. A representative of DWR was present as were several representatives of the consulting firm Navigant which assisted DWR in constructing its revenue requirement request.  The representatives of Navigant fielded most of the questions. Not much new information was garnered.  A little more clarity was shed on certain areas. Of interest to Enron would be that in determining the net short for each of the UDCs for which DWR was purchasing it assumed no change in the current direct access levels (which is approximately 2% of the load in the state) through 2002. Other points of clarification included: (1) A question exists with respect to whether DWR is responsible for the ISO costs billed to the UDCs for the period of January through June of 2001. (2) Any payments which were made to DWR to date by the UDCs would be netted against the revenue requirements requests for the first and second quarter of this year.  PG&E indicated that DWR's numbers for the revenue received from PG&E to date do not match its own accounting. (3) The net short calculation for each UDC was derived by using the net short forecasts provided by each of the UDCs an modifying them to take into account (1) a 4% reduction in load due to conservation efforts; (2) a 2% reduction in load due to price elasticity increasing to 3% by January 2001; (3) estimated impacts of the 20/20 program (assuming also a similar program for next summer); (4) the impact of the UDCs curtailment programs.  Once again, PG&E indicated its belief that DWR's net short projection for PG&E was erroneous. (4)  DWR explained that the basis for the projection that they would need 1.65 cents out of the three cents rate increase was that for sales made by DWR they already receive the UDC generation rate (i.e., approximately 6.8 cent for PG&E and 7.2 cent for SCE).  On top of that, they need the 1.65 cents. SCE submitted four pages of written questions to DWR on their revenue request.  DWR is to respond in writing (and serve on all people on the service list ) by Tuesday the 31st.  To the extent that the questions are applicable to PG&E, they will answer the question with respect to both UDCs. Please call if you have any questions. Jeanne Bennett

Attached for your information is a copy of the Petition for Modification of= =20 D.01-05-064 which ABAG POWER filed on July 13.? On behalf of ABAG, I would = =20 like to solicit your support of this petition.? The decision in question is= =20 the Commission's May 15 decision where it approved the rate design for the = =20 three-cent rate increase.?=20 ? You may recall that the decision approved a 12-month surcharge for all =20 bundled service customers to make up for the revenue which PG&E and SCE did= =20 not recover during the interim period between the March 27 issuance of =20 D.01-03-082 and the subsequent issuance of the May 15 decision.? You also = =20 know that the May decision provided specifically that DA customers were NOT= =20 to  be subject to the rate increase.=20 ? The ABAG petition for modification seeks to have the Commission clarify  th= at=20 DA customers who received DA service during the interim period between the = =20 two decisions should not be subject to the one-year sucharge, even if they= =20 were  subsequently returned to bundled service.? The arguments supporting= =20 this  position are as follows: Direct  access customers were specifically exempted from the=20 procurement-related rate  increase because they do not receive procurement= =20 service.? They should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month=20 procurement surcharge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled=20 service.? =20 The inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit= =20 have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under significa= nt=20 financial stress.? The Member public agencies have  suffered extreme=20 financial hardship.?  The application of the 12-month procurement surcharge= =20 has added to that  burden unnecessarily. In a separate  proceeding (draft Resolution E-3726),? the Commission has=20 expressed  its intent to =01&guard against inequities=018 for direct access= =20 customers of  SDG&E.? ABAG POWER asks simply  that the Commission afford=20 similar protection to the direct access customers  of PG&E who did not=20 receive bundled procurement service during the  interval between the March= =20 and May Decisions.?=20 Moreover, in addition  to being inequitable, the application of the=20 procurement surcharge to  non-procurement direct access customers would be= =20 discriminatory and would  cause the utilities to violate the=20 anti-discrimination provisions of the  Public Utilities Code, Sections 453(= a)=20 and 453(c).

Word on the street is that the CA ISO staff is NOT asking for a vote on price caps at the Board meeting on Thursday.  (I was speculating that the Board would be asked to lower the price caps to $100 or to adopt the CEO's proposal, which he filed at FERC on 10/20.)  The vote will be put off a vote until late November.  No reason given -- but presumably so they don't look like idiots if FERC comes out with something radically different on November 1. But, I have also heard that one Board member -- Mike Florio of TURN -- has asked for a vote on his proposal -- load-differentiated price caps (e. g.$250 when area load is 40,000 MW or more, $150 when load is between 30,000 and 40,000, etc.) If a few Board members, i.e., the utilities and some of the munis gang up, they can force a vote.  I'm expecting one, but given the staff's/CEO position, there may not be sufficient votes to go lower until FERC comes out with its proposal.

In case you didn't see it 7/16/01 -- Palmer quoted Senate power play jolts Enron  'The whole thing stinks to high heaven."" That was the assessment Adrian Moore, executive director of Reason Public Policy Institute, gave of a state Senate committee's recent move to hold Enron Corp. in contempt for refusing to hand over subpoenaed documents.  We're inclined to agree. The Texas-based energy merchant has filed a countersuit in Sacramento Superior Court, arguing that the Senate has no right to wield influence beyond state borders and that putting the documents into public view ""jeopardized confidential business information,"" the Register reported Thursday.  The court should order the Senate either to make its document request more specific or to drop the contempt charge and subpoena altogether. Robert Levy, a constitutional law expert at the Cato Institute, told us that Enron's point about disclosing confidential information will be its strongest argument in court.  While Enron can't hide behind state borders, Levy says the Senate's request is not tailored narrowly enough to ensure information that could damage Enron's market viability is not released. He said the Senate should have to let a judge decide whether releasing the documents is necessary for its investigation and avoids unfairly harming Enron.  Instead, the full Senate just has to approve the committee's recommendation for Enron's executives to become criminals. ""It seems to me that's a scary

Hi Wanda/Michael.  You aware of this?  I don't recall having received anything from PG&E. Best, Jeff 
PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen. We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits. I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want to discover there's a charge we don't know about. Thanks, Tamara.

Below are the notes from our lobbyist who attended the meeting today of opponents for the language to change the requirements for those getting e-signatures for selling products and services to small customers.

As I mentioned earlier this week, my associate Cliff Berg, representing AOL, co-sponsored a meeting in our office today regarding AB 256 (Wayne).  The meeting was run by Kay Caldwell on behalf of the Internet Alliance.  Kay was the one who contacted Jeff Dodd in Houston who I believe contacted one or both of you. The bill is being opposed by AOL, Microsoft, Charles Schwab, CMTA, Chamber, GTE/Verizon, AEA, Retailers, Financial Services Association and the Internet Alliance.  All of those parties are scheduled to meet with Assembly Member Wayne at different times on Wednesday to try and get him to drop the bill which is being sponsored by the Attorney General.  In the event that fails, the group is also trying to get the bill double-referred to the Senate Banking Committee where they have a much better chance of stopping it versus the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The bill will be heard by the Judiciary Committee on August 21. With respect to Enron's participation in any opposition effort, there was some concern that the Judiciary Committee may not be the best place because Peace is on that committee and would likely do anything to get at Enron (support?).  Regardless of anyone's concerns we could submit a letter of opposition so long as someone provides me with the general framework. Please advise. Scott

Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th. I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill? Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal. Best,

The Chief ALJ of the CPUC has put out for comment in the rate stabilization case a proposed services agreement between DWR and PG&E to cover meter reading and billing services provided to DWR by PG&E.  Of note is the fact that DWR will pay $1.7 million as a set up fee and between $80,000 and $115,000 a year for such services over the next four years.  Please advise if you want to review this agreement.  If direct access remains viable, this may represent an interesting precedent for utility billing and metering costs. Mike Day

This article gives Pat Wood of FERC's position supporting direct access in California.  Edelman worked with Bernadette Tansey on this article  and provided her with information on AReM and the DA coalition's goals, as well as background on direct access.  We are also currently working with the Chronicle's Editorial board to secure an editorial **************************************** Bush appointee warns state PUC on 'direct access' FERC panelist wants consumers to retain choice of energy firms Zachary Coile, Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday, June 28, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/28/MN207167.DTL Washington -- President Bush's key federal energy regulator warned California that it may hurt consumers if the state approves a proposal to bar power users from shopping around for the best prices for electricity. Patrick Wood, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Bush's liaison to the state on energy issues, criticized a plan before the California Public Utilities Commission to suspend a major element of the state's 1996 deregulation plan. Called ""direct access,"" the program allows businesses to cut deals with private power suppliers and permits consumers to choose among competing electricity providers, including firms that market renewable sources of energy. Members of the state PUC, which had been set to consider the issue today, said yesterday that they will delay the vote on direct access until Tuesday at the urging of Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Wood, who met with state PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch during a two-day trip to California earlier this week, said he fears that ending direct access will lock consumers into higher energy prices. ""I do worry about the future of retail competition,"" he said yesterday in Washington. ""I think a lot of things they're trying to do to resolve today's problem may really push off the benefits of direct access for quite a few

CONFIDENTIAL -- FERC SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS I have proposed quite a few changes and additions to the list.  I also ask some questions re some of the items listed. I added a section on Retail Reforms -- we cannot settle with the state unless we settle everything -- otherwise we know the outcome to expect. regarding your question on hourly day ahead markets -- I assume you're referring to the energy market that the PX used to run, because the CAISO already has day-ahead markets for congestion and ancillary services.  I discussed this proposal with Tim in March because the ISO's filing at FERC for market reforms had the ISO setting up such a market -- essentially putting the former PX inside the ISO (and for all you historians, finally creating the dream of POOLCO for California).  Tim asked us to oppose that proposal -- his view at the time was that we didn;t want the ISO running energY markets, because private third parties could do a much better job of that.  So, we opposed that in our filings commenting on the ISO's proposal in March. I'll be in the office Wednesday (Oops! Today).  Can we discuss this list and where we are headed? Sue Mara Enron Corp.

Monday, last week, I urged our retail coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM), to hold a press conference this week to draw media attention to the CPUC's vote on Thursday to suspend direct access.  AReM and its PR Firm agreed.  After a lot of work to line up customers, the press conference was held Tuesday morning in Scaramento. We had excellent turnout from customer groups.  Public statements of support for continuing direct access were made by the California Chamber of Commerce, CA Manufacturing and Technology Association, CA Large Electric Consumers Association, CA Retailers Association, School Project for RR (SPURR - forget the whole acronym but the org purchases gas and electricity for aggregated elementary and high schools), QUALCOM, City of Palm Springs, NYMEX, and the ESPs of Green Mountain, New Energy , Enron (me), and Strategic Energy.  All the major papers were there, San Jose Mercury News, SF Chronicle, LA Times, SD Union, OC Register, Wall Street Jr.  Also there were the energy trade press, Bloomberg, Public Radio and a capitol TV station.  All had the opportunity to ask questions of the customers. As planned, we let the customers take the limelight.  They made forceful cases for why the CPUC should not suspend DA and stressed that the Treasurer's concerns have been addressed in legislation (that has not yet been acted on) and are actively being negotiated at the Capitol.  They urged the CPUC not to take this action. I'll forward any media that results from this Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802

Attached for your review and comment is my first draft of comments to be filed on Monday with regard to the draft decisions of ALJ Barnett and Commissioner Bilas.? Please review it carefully, as I have thrown in everything I can think of on a rush basis, and it may require some significant  editing.? Pay particular attention to Section V dealing with Bilas' request  for parties to discuss alternatives to DA suspension.? The draft offers a  compromise to the DWR's concerns, as expressed in the Angelides memo.?  Also, notice that Section VI urges the Commission to bifurcate the DA and PX  credit issues, acting quickly on the first, if it must, but more leisurely on  the PX credit subject. ? Finally, I have a suggestion?in the form of a question.? How  would AReM members feel about making this a joint filing with WPTF?? There  is cross-membership between the two groups and the same issues would be raised in the separate filings which I am otherwise prepared to draft.? This draft would requires some modifications so as to refer to the ""Joint Parties"" as opposed to solely mentioning AReM, and I might? add a section dealing more explicitly with WPTF's contribution to getting the zero minimum bill stipulation  signed in the first place.? Otherwise, the document would stay much as it  is (subject to your input over the next few days, of course).? Please let  me know what you think asap, as I am already working on a WPTF draft.?  Incidentally, I will also be filing comments on behalf of ABAG which will  support the positions taken in the attached document, but I am not proposing  that ABAG also be a party to this filing.?

Access Two proposed decisions were issued by hard copy and received today.  Jim Steffes' office in Houston has a copy. Both decisions eliminate the requirement that the utilities provide cash refunds to the direct access customers for the negative PX Credit as of Januray 5, 2000. On other points they differ. The decision by Assigned Commissioner Wood is adversarial to direct access and suspends direct access. If adopted, direct access would be suspended July 1, 2001, except for written contracts executed prior to July 1, 2001.  On the PX Credit, he says that the cash payment is not required and leaves open the notion that the bill credit would continue. The alternate decision by Commissioner Bilas does not suspend direct access but asks for ideas on how to provide DA given ABX 1 and the concerns of the state's Dept of Finance when providing comments on the draft decision.  Bilas has a finding of fact that ""direct access is a necessary component of restoration of functional electricity markets."" On the PX credit, Bilas' proposed decision would end the cash payment but begin a process to modify the PX credit decision (D.99-06-058) and to adopt a bottoms-up calculation for direct access customers.  He asks for comments in 20 days and reply comments in 5 days. With a bottoms-up calculation, direct access customers would pay only wires charges and public purpose charges and pay no charge for power purchases. Comments on the draft decisiona are due next Monday, June 25. Enron and its coalitions will actively support the Bilas alternate and seek the third vote needed to ensure passage. Sue Mara Enron Corp.

looms as a high political hurdle Dan Walters: Repaying huge power debts still looms as a high political hurdle (Published June 13, 2001) Gov. Gray Davis has been running around California lately proclaiming that California is ""turning the corner"" on the energy crisis, explicitly citing sharply lower wholesale prices for electricity and, implicitly, his improved standing in polls. Events will reveal whether Davis' June hubris was justified. Despite the recent drop in spot power prices, however, many aspects of the energy crisis remain unresolved, and chief among them is liquidating the $20 billion-plus in debts that utilities and the state have accumulated for power purchases. A $13.4 billion bond issue that is supposed to reimburse the state's general fund for more than $8 billion advanced for power purchases and then finance future electricity buys has been hung up by demands of potential bond underwriters for more assurances about repayment. The bonds may not be sold until August, if ever. And by then, nearly the entire bond issue may have to flow to the state's general fund, leaving little to finance future power buys. And then there are the $14 billion or so in debts that the state's two big utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, incurred for power purchases before their credit was cut off in January. PG&E already has declared bankruptcy, and Edison was on the verge when Davis hurriedly signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" (MOU) on a rescue scheme, the centerpieces being state purchase of Edison's share of the intercity power grid, plus a plan for ratepayers to pay off the utility's debts. The Edison scheme has been denounced as a ""bailout"" by consumer activists and faces certain legislative rejection, despite a multimillion-dollar lobbying and public relations drive by the utility. And it's sparked a complex set of private maneuvers in and around the Capitol that are fraying the already cool relations between Davis and the Legislature's most powerful leader, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton. Davis called a dozen senators into his office Monday to press approval of the Edison MOU with minimal changes. Burton, who didn't attend, says the governor threatened legislators with rejection of their bills or budget appropriations if they didn't play ball, and promised retaliation if Davis uses strong-arm tactics for Edison. ""On an issue like this, they (legislators) ought to be able to vote their consciences,"" Burton told reporters, denouncing the Edison deal as a

When Gary Ackerman announced at services for Kent the creation of the award, I was deeply touched and impressed. My good friend Jeff Dasovich told me this weekend that you received the very first award, and well, I must say I became a bit teary-eyed.  You probably don't know me, but I've seen you at Commission meetings and have heard your name over the recent years.  My other fishing friend, Bill Sandoval, who was also at the services, says whomever received this award ""must be a real tiger"" and we need more people like that in California.

Cal-ISO/FERC -2: Companies Allegedly Gamed Power Market Updated: Friday, June 8, 2001 05:29 PM ET   Email this article to a friend! Printer-friendly version LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market.  Duke Energy (DUK, news, msgs), Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs), Mirant Corp. (MIR, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, msgs) have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power - the ability to influence electricity prices - in California's wholesale power market. The ISO, which manages the state's high-voltage transmission system, recently made a similar filing against AES Corp. (AES, news, msgs) and Williams Cos. (WMB, news, msgs), claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power.  The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators' authority to charge market-based rates for their power supply. Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations.  ""We've obviously just got the filing and we're reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing. But we're also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down,"" Williams said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said the ISO's allegations are ""nothing new.""  ""It's similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators,"" Wheatley said. ""The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief. The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand. The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be 
Current word is that the draft decision will be held over at least to the June 21 meeting.  Enron, along with the members of the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, are launching an all-out campaign to get the decision changed.  Commissioner Bilas has indicated that he may draft an alternate that deletes the language.  Of course, we are still flying blind.  The draft has not been released to the public. Sue Mara Enron Corp.

I wanted to make sure that everyone involved with the CA New Product was aware that the CPUC may consider at its next public meeting (6/14) the implementation of the Direct Access suspension established in AB1x1. We are hearing that the CPUC may not have 3 votes in favor of such suspension, but the topic is on the agenda.  It is very difficult to get any clarity on this issue given the politics and ex parte restricitions. Even if the CPUC does not take action on this language at the next meeting, until that provision of the law is modified by the General Assembly, the CPUC could take action at a later time. Please call me if anyone has any questions. Jim 3x7673

Given today's Order from FERC setting ISO price caps at $250 MWh for the next 60 days and specifically rendering the October 26th ISO board vote on a load differentiated cap null and void, we have ceased efforts to implement the October 26th motion. Prior to today's Order, the ISO had been working internally and with vendors on implementation details. Also, a conference call was held with Market Participants on October 30th to assess their implementation needs. Based on this initial work, it appeared that implementation could occur in early January 2001 but this work is being stopped as a result of today's Order.

CalPX's take on FERC's ability to end mandatory buy requirement. DJ CalPX Responds To FERC, Denies It Worsened Power Prices Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The chief executive officer of the California Power Exchange responded Tuesday to details in a federal energy regulatory report that suggests the two-year-old exchange's mandatory buy requirement was partly to blame for this past summer's soaring wholesale electricity prices. The details of the landmark probe prepared by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to be released Wednesday morning, but some commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires the report will suggest that the state's mandatory buy rule should be abolished and utilities should be permitted to purchase their power through other power exchanges. ""We believe that the representation of the CalPX contributing to soaring wholesale prices is incorrect and misleading,"" said CalPX CEO George Sladoje. ""Over the summer months, certain wholesale market participants chose to not take full advantage of the price and cost mitigating products offered through the CalPX...if a participant chose to purchase all or most of their energy on the spot market, they often paid much more than other participants who chose to buy in the forwards market,"" Sladoje added. It is widely known in the wholesale electricity market that Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. purchased most of their power in the spot market, which the utility passed on to its customers at a much higher price. SDG&E also complained to federal regulators that the CalPX hourly and day-ahead market clearing prices are too high. When California moved to electricity deregulation four years ago, a statewide power exchange was created requiring Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. to purchase all of their power through the exchange until 2002, the expected transition date to a completely deregulated market. But the FERC report proposes that utilities be permitted to purchase power from other exchanges in an effort to generate increased competition, commissioners said. The CalPX purchases power one day in advance for California's three investor-owned utilities. Suppliers bid in power indicating their price. For each hour of the next day, the price of the last megawatt taken to meet demand sets the market price. In various reports issued since 1996, FERC has commended the state's Power Exchange for running a successful market that helped mitigate concerns about market power abuses. If the FERC report suggests that California end the mandatory buy requirement, it will be up to state lawmakers to see to draft Legislation to change the market rules, according to the CalPX. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 31-10-00

California Administration Helps Electricity Consumers by Proposing Reliability Standards and Working to Lower Costs Clinton/Gore Administration Takes Action to Help Californians Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson today announced a series of initiatives that the Clinton/Gore Administration is taking to help California reduce the strain on their electricity system and protect consumers. Most significantly, Richardson said the Administration will likely send a proposed rule-making to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish mandatory reliability standards for electricity * doing administratively what Congress failed to accomplish this year. ""California's electricity market has become dysfunctional -- and it's time to make it right,"" said Secretary Richardson. ""More than once, California was close to having blackouts rolling throughout the state. In San Diego, residents and businesses saw their electric bills double almost overnight. Consumers need an electricity system that is reliable and they should not be 
I called Ed Chang from the Western Area Power Administration to ask about the DOE involvement. It just so happened that he had attended the press conference.  He and other state people were at a meeting to discuss how the federal agnecies could work with state agencies.  They had only been meeting for 15 minutes when they were told that they were going to be bussed over to SMUD's Hedge Substation (don't you love the name?) for the press conference. Richardson arrived with a flurry of black limos to announce his program. Ed's view is that this was all for PR and that the ""changes"" don't help California at all. The WAPA transformer referred to by Richardson is already planned and in its approved budget (it is a joint upgrade project of the 500 kV lines by WAPA, PG&E and others at the Tracy and Tesla Substations). Richardson did not even stay for the Governor's speach.  He left for the airport.  The Governor arrived in a flurry of black limos.  He addressed the FERC order a bit.  He felt FERC should have addressed the issue of refunds for CA consumers. He was also concerned about FERC's order on governance.  He said that deregulatrion was brought to us by Senator Peace and the Wilson administration, but that the market is very different now than it was in 1996.

Sam,  I took a quick look at what Mona had done and had a few clarifying changes.  Let either of us know if you need more help. 
Gang, I didn't get Jim's e-mail but .....  Here are my comments This looks good as a bottomline message, but I'd like to dress it up and take it out on a date first (doesn't dasovich talk like this?) I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS this summer.  To the contrary, in the west, we were working with some customers (a  few hundred MWs)  to participate in the ISO's program -- after the Board voted to lower the cap to $250 -- the customers all said sayonara -- could no longer justify the expense and the interference in their operations.  These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail demand response. This only goes so far, however... The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids from the price caps.  SO, we need more... I think we should focus on the practical effects of a ""soft"" cap (not simple 
In response to Jim's E-mail  - here's is my proposed list of issues for Enron's November 9 comments.  We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow so please comment on this ASAP. We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information Here's my rationale.  Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market information to market participants.  We could summarize the positions we took in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at all and why we need information.  In addition, we should assume that they will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not addressed the problems created by OOM. In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms, balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues as we go.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION'S REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis' remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) report: ""My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable. That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making a good start. ""Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day. ""Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive, which it is not. ""I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through. ""FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California. ""I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop. Question inaudible. ""It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days. Question inaudible. ""We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is. But we are making progress. Question inaudible. ""That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this ill-conceived scheme. ""I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment, critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before. ""I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon. Question inaudible. ""Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in 1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards. Question inaudible. ""You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck. Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today. Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in 1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state. FERC seems to be suggesting today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep. ""I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare. Without electricity there is no economic growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations.

GREETINGS: So, we're all happy that FERC finally made a decision.  Traders tell me the market has stabilized and people think much of the regulatory uncertainty has ended.  NOT SO FAST..... I am NOT an attorney -- but here are my current guesses. ISSUE:  FERC has created a huge constitutional issue with the state of CA. The FERC has ordered the ISO to do something differently than what was specified in the state legislation, AB 1890.  The last time this happened, in late 1999 (on ISO and PX governance), the state reared its back -- and FERC caved in.  So let's not be sanguine about what FERC has done here.  Much will need to be done by Enron and others to bolster FERC. THE COURTS:  The state could get its back up and decide to fight this.  The potential is that FERC will get political pressure to ""settle"", once a request for rehearing is submitted.  Remember --- this is ALL political. It's not about logic.  Last time, the state, through the Oversight Board, submitted a request for rehearing with FERC.  FERC told them to pound sand, so the EOB then filed in federal court to overturn the order.  This was ""settled"" when the state negotiated with FERC behind the scenes and FERC did a 180. (We have a court case pending on that order.)  If the state decides to go the rehearing route, I'm not too sure when they could initiate court action.  They could probably file for an emergency stay, but they tried that in the last court case and it was rejected. GOVERNOR:   A little has been trickling out.  Gov. Davis went to town at a press conference yesterday, talking about gouging generators and sending $6 billion out of state.  He stated his unhappiness with the FERC not providing refunds.  He says his adminstration will continue its fight to have refunds ordered. His administration will ""participate fully"" in the FERC hearing on Nov 9.  The Governor believes that the state lost control of its transmission system when it passed 1890.  So, I could conceive of some legislation or a federal push to ""give it back.""  I don't think that would be ultimately successful, but it would likely create some wild times. FEDERAL:  The press reported that U.S. Sen Feinstein will introduce a measure in the next few days to give FERC retroactive refund authority. STATE LEGISLATURE:     State Sen Bowen has said she plans to hold a hearing

Leave this to the UDCs -- we are also OK with the penalty.  The main problem for the ISO operators is the lack of resources being scheduled day-ahead, so I think we should be OK with that penalty. Mary Hain@ECT 11/03/2000 09:42 AM 
We have discovered another problem that we may want to discuss in our oral comments, although the UDCs may cover it.  Even though the FERC removes the forward market prohibition, the UDCs will not be in the forward market because: (1) the PUC may find they were imprudent and (2) the FERC's penalty is only for underscheduling load in the day-ahead or the day-of market, not for load failing to be hedged in the forward market.

BEFORE I send the last piece in -- here is the whole thing -- PLEASE look at Sheet 3 -- RCR stuff -- there is nothing for EBS -- check out the other stuff 
Here are all the pieces of the budget.  There are three sheets.  The first two correspond to the separate categories that Rick used at the budget meeting in Houston last Friday.  The third is our discretionary budget -- or RCR-related -- dollars.  I've included the estimate of existing RCRs that will run over and the potential new ones.  Most of our work is now being done in coalitions. ARM has decided to cut down on the monies spent at the CPUC and instead to put it into PR and lobbying.  This budget felects the switch -- with smaller dollars anticipated for the CPUC and a retainer requested for ARM's PR and 
Now you're double SCUM !!! Yes, I sent an e-mail out on TUESDAY!!!!! Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 11/17/2000 12:06 PM 
Sure Sue has filled you in, but just to be certain, my understanding is that Dan Douglas, attorney for WPTF, is going to meet with the AG (not sure when) in an attempt to narrow the scope of the subpoena.  Dan also plans to begin drafting responses to the subpeona.  Since we are a member of WPTF and therefore presumably covered by the subpoena, seems important that our attorney's coordinate with Dan.  Sue, if I've mangled anything, let me know. Best, Jeff 
Mary told me ONLY to send it to Sanders 
Dan Douglass from Arter & Hadden in the Los Angeles area is WPTF's attorney. He plans to meet with the attorney from the AGs office to try to narrow the scope of the questions.  In the meantime, he will be putting something together in draft, which he will circulate to everyone.  But it's not due 
Mark, Here's my shot.  I did it in Revision mode so you can see the changes.  Note that Enron never got out of the retail market in CA and has gathered about 1,000 MW of retail load -- we're bigger than all but two of the municipal utilities in the state.  Enron stopped marketing to residential consumers -- that's what all the  fuss was about in 1997.  Anyone else feel free to take your own shot. Sue Mark Schroeder@ECT 11/17/2000 09:52 AM 
Some of our people get asked on the phone about what is going on in California.  I have drafted the attached paper for their use.  It is intended to be simple and user-friendly.  Your thoughts on whether I achieved that objectvie are welcome.  More importantly, I need you to confimr that I got the story and facts correct, and that I have not said anything about the situation that you (Enron USA) would not want to say, or have not said, or if we have said something fundamentally different, I need to know that, too. thanks for taking the time to review.  mcs 
We are part of a retail coaltion called ARM.  ARM has hired a PR Firm, Edelman.  At the first meeting today, one of Edelman's VPs mentioned that Nancy Vogle is preparing a BIG report on the current deregulation situation. She is excited about talking to some retailers.  We are in the process of putting our collective message points together, which I will pass along.  A few ARM members will then meet with Nancy in the next two weeks.  Will keep you apprised. 
This is pretty much an all-out attack against the positions that we and the= =20 generators have taken. =20 
Senator Steve Peace held a press conference today to discuss, as chair of the Senate Budget Committee, the Senate Budget proposal with contain $2 billion for a special reserve for energy initiatives. He stated that he is not proposing any uses for this money, that it is designed to =01&preserve the options for the Governor=018 and other policy = makers in dealing with California=01,s energy woes.  However, he proceeded to outl= ine some possible options, including the state taking over the transmission system, condemning power plants and the state running them, condemning just the output of the states power plants, or having the state build power plants.  Again, he is not proposing these, they are just options for the Governor. Other comments of interest: - Generators are only willing to build power plants if they can get 14 cent= s kw/hr.  If that=01,s the case, the state can build them for cheaper. - He noted that today the CEC will release some data that calls into questions there is a supply problem.  Independent energy producers have =01&fabricated the supply problem.=018 - Criticized generators for pushing for retail solutions, saying that =01&nothing would be more disastrous than opening the retail market before = the wholesale market is controlled.=018 - =01&Generators are extorting the law=018 and =01&running roughshod over C= alifornia=01, s environmental law=018 in a =01&well-orchestrated political agenda.=018 - Generators are in a =01&full-scale attack on the balance sheets=018 of th= e investor-owned utilities. - He also said that the IOUs have indicated that they would be willing to get back into the generation business if the state finances it. - Generators are asking FERC to keep prices artificially high. - He still insists that rates are outright market manipulation, and that generators were holding back thousands of megawatts of power this summer. Cites today=01,s higher prices as an example. Please contact me or our office if you would like a copy of the press release or the other supporting materials, including his letter to Lynch that urges the CPUC to deny the IOUs cost pass-through request, and asks th= e CPUC to order the IOUs =01&to exhaust their legal remedies to obtain refund= s from all parties who were the beneficiaries of the proceeds of the unlawful wholesale charges the IOUs incurred.=018 --end-- Julee Malinowski-Ball Associate Edson+Modisette 916-552-7070 Fax- 552-7075 jmball@ns.net 
Pretty good LA Times editorial.  ""Tracy"" is with ARM's new PR Firm -- their job will be to let people know that retail competition is essential 
Here is WPTF's draft  with my additions.  It proposes going with Hebert's formula.   I added some language to have the starting point be $350 or higher.  All the Hoecker questions are answered -- I was fine with it.  And Dan has a section at the end describing CA as Regulatory Luddites -- I LOVED it! 
This looks really good -- I LOVED the Luddite Section!!! I took out a lot of the PX wonderfulness -- the PX can say that stuff in its own comments and we have no independent way to verify what they say. Also, I made a lot of changes to clarify or add thoughts.  Make sure the color graphics look OK in black and white. My only disappiontment -- was no talk about the retail market or how CA regulators should focus on that -- I added the thought in one spot. Because it is so long -- but still good-- I think a table of contents would really help-- so people see what is there and can flip to the relevant sections -- it also gets our full message across simply by looking at the headings. 
Bob Anderson of APSES developed these data.  They show that the utilities took unbelievably outrageous open positions in the market this summer. There are two possibilities: 1 they are incompetent (WRONG) or 2 they were OK from a corporate perspective (because of other long positions) and expected to receive regulatory relief.  Bob will write it up and add as testimony in an appendix -- Gary Ackerman likely witness. 
My brain is fried.  Can you remember what kind of opt in-out thing the CPUC had?  I remember it being a fiasco. 
Sue, Frank Rishe has ask me to search for the states that have allowed customers to opt in or out of marketing lists. Does California require utilities to offer a customer the opportunity to decide on who they want to market to them for energy services? If so did we take a position on it? Thank you so very much, Lynnette 
Congrats to Paul.  FERC approved the PGE/Sierra merger!!

I am OK with the language because of the use of the word ""appropriate"" before ""retail rate freezes"".  However, in discussing this with Steven, it seems as if IEP has not yet put some guidance around ""appropriate.""  I would like to do so,  I suggest that IEP support a rate freeze solely for small customers -- if necessary -- and a similar rate freeze or even a shorter-term rate freeze for larger customers only as a last resort.  Do we need a call to discuss this? ""Katie Kaplan"" <kaplan@iepa.com> 11/20/2000 07:20 PM Please respond to kaplan 
Language referenced: ""Stabilize prices and protect consumers against rate spikes - by directing utilities to diversify their energy supply ""portfolios"" with a prudent balance of short- and long-term power contracts, and by extending appropriate retail rate freezes until 2003. Greetings: Based on the responses we have received regarding the above language in the Seeing the Light and Power Up documents; a consensus has been reached, with one exception, to keep the language as it stands today and to continue to circulate the documents as printed, in order to respond in a timely manner to events such as the Governors press release. This approach will enable us to also respond to Senator Peace's press conference and another anticipated press conference by Governor Davis. There were several suggestions to rephrase the sentence in the future printing of documents in order to have more flexibility. We will continue to look at alternative language and will make a decision for the next printing. If there are any suggestions for language to replace this sentence please forward them to me no later than COB Wednesday November 22.  We will then circulate the new language for agreement. Thank you for your attention to this matter and please let me know if you have any questions. Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association (916) 448-9499

Union-Tribune Don't know- Does anyone know? 
I know that WPTF is supporting Hebert's approach and would suggest starting with $250 or higher with big increments every six months.  WPTF is also asking for clarification on what the cap applies to.  I don't recall what the comments said on refund and I haven't taken a look at the WPTF final yet. I'll let you know.  I'll check on the others today. James D Steffes 11/22/2000 07:30 AM 
As I've been thinking about our response today, I would like Enron to focus on making sure that the California (WSCC) markets are as good a possible for business over the next 15 to 24 months.  Following that idea, I think that the key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2) reducing the burden/risk of the prospective refund period. I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power / retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do much more on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can given the current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds become an issue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight this fight. I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bring these issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all of our other arguments. Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by quietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes?  Sue Mara, can you please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to file?  I want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not getting too soft. Jim

EES is concerned about the 95% requirement. What EES would like is to do is to ask FERC for a modification as follows: 1.  Change the requirement to 90%     OR 2.  Apply the 95% penalty solely to underscheduling of load (the draft order talks about it as a deviation, implying plus or minus, even though the section talks only about underscheduling of load) Also, EES would like some clarification that the rule applies to an entities' entire load. We can justify these modifications by pointing out that smaller scheduling cooridinators (i.e. smaller than the PX or IOUs) have less diverse loads and are more subject to on forseen swings -- so 95% is very difficult to achieve -- another disincentive to direct access and compeition. Time is marching on--

BAND WIDTH 
HERE are the good parts: CMUA asks FERC to order quick release of bid and other inf to the market participants; cites Australian rules, England & Wales, and Alberta -- Miracles do happen! Opposes 5% deviation band for underschedu;ing -- recommends a fixed band with a minimum of 2 MW for ""smaller"" SCs As an alternative -- asks for an 8% band. Does not address the pplication to generation. The bad parts: Thinks the Governor should appoint three of the Board members and the other three should be appointed by the WSCC Board of Trustees. (the ISO CEO makes the 7th) Wants the Board to report back after 2 years to see how RTOS might fit in in CA. Still wants to return to cost-of-service rates. Opposes opportunity costs as factor in evaluating bids above $250 Wants costs allocated properly -- in other words re-allocated away from the munis.

Sue, Mona, 1.  Tomorrow Martin Wenzel is speaking at a 1200 BOMA Luncheon at the Sheraton Palace Hotel at the Corner of Market and New Montgomery in San Francisco.  Martin was hoping that one of you might be available to attend. He thought that if you were not busy it might be valuable to have a government affairs expert available in case any tough regulatory questions came up.  If you are both busy I am sure we will get by.  We are currently trying to structure a new offering for their membership in the greater East Bay Area. 2.  Below is an excerpt from an e-mail I received from a customer.  My first inclination is that the customer is talking about the $65.00 rate cap in place in SDG&E and does not understand the implementation.  But this customer happens to be very savvy and is normally very involved in the regulatory environment.  Is there a new issue regarding some type of $65.00 rate cap that is being discussed for 2001 that is different from the current SDG&E proposal?  If so, what are the details.  As you can see below, depending on how it is implemented, it could be a problem.  My interpretation of the comments below is that this customer thinks a $65.00 rate cap is going to be put in place in 2001 and any charges above this cap are going to be shared by all rate payers equally. Therefore, it does them no good to lock in a higher price with an ESP if the market price is above $65.00.  I have a phone call in to the customer to get more details. ""We should talk about prices for next year, because it is my belief that UDC prices must be below $65.00 next year; any price above that mark should be

Yesterday, a number of parties to the Interruptible OII c.00-10-002) filed their proposals for what changes should be made to the utilities' interruptible programs.  A summary of those filings will be distributed later this week.  In addition the Energy Producers and Users Coalition filed an emergency motion yesterday to make certain ""refinements"" to the utilities' programs. Specifically, the motion requests that the Commission: 1. Order Edison and PG&E to implement Optional Binding Mandatory Curtailment (OBMC) programs for all distribution level customers.  The OBMC should provide flexible program criteria, recognizing that not all customers have the same operational capability to control the manner and extent of curtailment as envisioned by the Commission in directing the implementation of mandatory curtailment plans in D.91548; 2. Establish clear procedures by which customers who are not operationally suited to participate in the OBMC but who face some level of increased environmental damage, health or safety risk upon sudden curtailment may qualify under the ""Essential Use"" category of customers; and 3. Approve a new service alternative for customers that would experience a disproportionate business interruption and economic impact upon interruption. Let me know if you want to see a copy of the motion.

The following is an excerpt from a FERC order issued on Friday: ""Ridgewood Power LLC (Ridgewood) filed comments suggesting that the shortage of supply could be remedied in part by relaxing the operating efficiency and other regulatory requirements pertaining to Qualifying Facilities (QFs). Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 MW are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the remainder from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs). Ridgewood states that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is underutilized because of operating efficiency and other QF requirements. With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that these underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak and off-peak periods.  Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 MWs would be immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing utility or into the competitive market their ""above-baseline"" output for a limited time period.   Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency standards......... Section 292.205(c) of the Commission's regulations provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency standards ""upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy savings"".   However, the Commission has exercised its waiver authority in a number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill PURPA's goals.   We find that many of these same factors are present here. Consistent with the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver in this circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the Cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through increasing the availability of needed capacity.  Therefore, we will grant temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration QFs for sales into California, effective as of the date of this order.  We 
PG&E TO5 On Nov 22, FERC set this for hearing.  Enron intervened late, but we are now a party.  PG&E is attempting to increase its rates by about 16%.

The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a court tells them not to.  DO we care about this? Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC-- given the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info? Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC claims identify those who have abused market power. 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO Tariff section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly, the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20 unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4 which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in the past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an outage and projected in service date since this information could be used by Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current requests.

Senator Burton, President Pro-Tem, has asked for the name and address of all the CEOs of the ""generators"".   This request has come through Julie Malinowski from the Independent Energy Producers' (IEP) lobbying firm, Edson and Modisette.  Burton gave her a list on which Enron appeared.  I asked her to eliminate us from the list and say that we are not generators.  If Burton comes back anyway, I have given Julie the names and addresses of Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.

DJ Edison To Call For End To Calif Elec Dereg Wed -Sources Copyright (c) 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Edison International (EIX), saying the current state of California's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy, will call Wednesday for an end to California's four-year experiment with deregulation, sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires. John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, won't be able to recover more than $3 billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped. In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation, Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within 90 days and re-enter the power-generation business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law, the sources said. Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as 20%, the sources said, even though regulators rejected Edison's request for a rate increase of 10% last week. The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal, which would require action by the state legislature, the sources said. Southern California Edison, with 4.2 million customers, is one of the country's largest electric utilities. Edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and, as it says on its Web site, ""played a central role in the restructuring of the 
WPTF will be submitting a ton of data to the AG office tomorrow.  It consists of all WPTF-related data -- no member-specific data.  It includes a password to the WPTF web site so that the guy can read all the regulatory filings we've made -- and the burritos (weekly newsletters to the membership).  Also they are submitting all meeting minutes, Gary's day planner and the bylaws.

Apparently the email between my firm and Williams is being delayed by hanging chads.? 90 minutes ago,?Alex Goldberg sent me an additional  sentence to be added to the end of the second paragraph of the filing and an additional clause to be added to the end of the?first sentence of the third paragraph.? However, it still has not been received.? So, Alex  dictated the change, it's been sent to our DC office, and here is the absolutely  final version?for your information. ? Dan 
Thanks for the feedback.  I hope you will be able to weigh in at the Tuesday meeting of IEP -- the position of IEP will be debated there.  Don't we want the trade association to be taking the tough positions for us? Out front and in public? richard_n_wheatley@reliantenergy.com 12/13/2000 12:38 PM 
Sue, Appreciated your stance on the conference call. We can't hide our heads in the sand at this point, as the governor will not let up and, despite his political intentions now or later, still enjoys taking shots at ostriches. Best regards.

This could be the Big Bang.  We need to be prepared for media. 
Market Participants: Be advised that there is a strong possibility that there will be 1000-3000MW of firm load curtailed this afternoon.  In addition to ongoing issues related to gas prices, some participants are now indicating that they cannot sell into the markets due to credit concerns. We are taking a number of actions to remedy the supply shortage, including work with State and Federal government representatives.

The Dems are going for it! 
California Senator Feinstein, Governor Davis, Secretary of Energy Richardson, and FERC Commissioner Hoecker held a joint press conference related to the California energy problem.  They indicated a critical need for supply TODAY to serve the California marketplace.  Secretary Richardson indicated he will exercise his emergency power under the Federal Power Act [section 202(c)] to direct generation to California.  The Secretary indicated that DOE, under the FPA, will set a fair price for the power. IEP requests all its members to deliver as much generation as possible to California ASAP in order to avert potential shortages. In addition, the Governor and Senator Feinstein called for regionwide price caps and mandatory, reasonable long-term contracts between generators and the utilities.  They made the point that 4,000 - 5,000 MWs are being exported from the state, currently a lack of adequate planning and scheduling of resources/planned outages exists, and indicated that the CPUC would moved to implement forward contracting. IEP will forward the formal statement from the Press Conference (or a

I'll be on vacation Tuesday, but am reachable by phone. And, yes, my position is that I want trade associations taking a firm stance in cases such as we face in Calif. Having worked with many trade groups over the years, including API, IPAA, SGA, AGA and the various Mid-Continent O/G assns. as a lobbyist and from a public affairs standpoint, know a weak assn. does one no good in the long run. It's imperative that the stronger members drive the process. Unfortunately, arriving at consensus is far from easy, and many trade groups would rather let the individual companies get out front because the assn. can't reach consensus among its wishy-washy members. We've had to do that somewhat in Calif. and have been working very hard with selected media on our own to educate them since the issue arose in the summer. Believe we are making headway, but can't let up now. RW 
The following is the list of suppliers referenced by Governor Davis in today 's Washington, DC press conference.  For those of you that are IEP members, it would be helpful if you forwarded to IEP any comments you have made or plan on making to the press. These suppliers have advised the ISO that they are unwilling to sell power into the California markets.

We believe we should not be on the list.  We have not refused to sell.  The ISO has not been interested in the little we can make available because it is all in SP 15 and the power is needed in NP15. ""Julee Malinowski-Ball"" <jmball@ns.net> 12/13/2000 02:57 PM

In lay speak, the new alternative decision looks like it could lead to a very quick end to the rate freeze and the associated PX Credit.  Roger's suggesting sometime in the 1st Quarter 2001 
The CPUC Meeting agenda changed the following item to read as follow: A99-01-016 - Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). For authority to establish post-transition period electric ratemaking mechanisms. A.99-01-019, A.99-01-034, A.99-02-029, A.00-10-028 - Related matters. This decision addresses the extraordinary financial situation facing PG&E and Edison as a result of current problems in the wholesale electric market and includes an assessment of accounting changes and adjustments previously proposed in this proceeding. Simultaneously, the Commission will expedite its review of market valuation proceedings to determine the feasibility of lifting the rate freeze as expeditiously as possible, and to evaluate the need for reasonable rate increases. Previously, this item read as follows: ""The decision denies the emergency petitions to modify D99-10-057 and D..... filed by PG&E and SCE on October 4, 2000. The decision adopts the accounting changes proposed by TURN as a first step in assessing the impacts of electric restructuing on cost recovery.The Commission will continue to monitor the impact on the utilities in future phases of this proceeding or successor
