Stacey, Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda and have the following suggestions: 1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.) 2.  German Energy Markets 3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year that might also be appropriate: Christophe's panel discussion on new markets E-commerce panel I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions

Marcus - I understand you are the new physical power online lawyer - lucky you! Here's one that the EOL people are anxious to get covered.  I'd be happy to sit down and go over exactly what all this means and you'll probably want to talk to Tana a bit as well. Mark 
Mark, Please take a look at this and advise me as to how I could move this forward for a Monday release. Kevin 
Kevin- I apologize for not getting back with you on this. I don't know if you know but I have resigned from Enron and have only a few days left. I am swamped with a lot of other work and I have asked my boss, Elizabeth Sager, to appoint a new atty to handle EOL matters (until Leslie Hansen returns). She can be reached on x36349.

Please review the following attachment containing the proposed long description for the Physical Power Spread requested by Sean Crandall.  Sean has reviewed and approved the language for use on his product.  I will be setting this product up for testing once I receive word back from you. Thank you. Kevin 
I suggest you work through Matthew Dawson in the London legal department. They should be able to help you. Angeline Poon 03/16/2001 12:22 AM 
Hi Mark I would be grateful if you could please let us know which paralegal has been assigned to assist in the matter. We have just signed an ISDA Master Agreement with Caltex Trading Pte Ltd and the same has to be executed by an officer of Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. Many thanks Angie 
Hi Mark Please let me know which paralegal has been assigned to assist in this matter. Thanks. Regards Matt 
Sounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions: Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest? If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there - in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check. Peter Keohane 04/02/2001 07:02 PM 
Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an ""instrument"" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property Security Act, and an ""instrument"" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate further?  Peter.

Bill - If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty. Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system. My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed. In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know. Mark

CP/ID 94330, Cargill Ferrous International FYI... Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill, Inc. Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure. Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name. Best Rgds.

We will need to catch a cab to get to La Fogata which is located at 2427 Vance Jackson Road in San Antonio.  Our dinner reservations are for 7:00 pm, so I suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30 and catch group cabs together.  Dress is casual.  The phone number for the restaurant is 210-340-1337, in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar (this will have special meaning to certain swap group members!).  If you haven't RSVP'd back to me, please do so, so I can get an accurate head count for tomorrow. See you in San Antonio. 
As you already know, it's that time again.  Since I am leaving on vacation Friday morning, please use the system to input your suggested reviewers no later than noon tomorrow (Thursday) so that I can approve them and get the process started before I leave.  Sorry for the inconvenience. 
Peter: My only concerns would be: (1) To the extent of any overlap in customers (which seems unlikely but it's happened here), we would want all of the transactions to be in the same entity for netting and setoff purposes. (2)  It's been a while since we've done any due diligence focused on retail financial transactions in Canada.  We are pretty restricted in that area in the US.  As I remember it, the new law and subsequent regulations we unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in Canada. (3)  If traders in the US might close one of these transactions with a Canadian counterparty or traders in Canada transacted with a US counterparty, they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between Enron Canada and ENA. Let me know if I can be of any help. Mark T. Peter Keohane 05/09/2001 03:28 PM 
Mark (and Mark) are there any concerns with Enron Direct Canada (EDC) (the mass markets retail affiliate, that is soon to be a subsidiary of EES) as opposed to Enron Canada (as wholesale affiliate of ENA) entering into financial transactions?  To date EDC has been entering into physical transactions only for gas and power under forms that have been developed based upon our wholesale physical contracts, Enron Direct UK's form, and compliance with the local regulatory requirements for retailers.  If EDC was to enter into financial transactions, they would tend to be papered under omnibus financial GTCs with EDC (as ISDAs would likely not be marketable). Of course credit would need to be obtained in advance, and the transactions are not booked until the counterparty executes the paper.  Please let me know. Peter.

REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES 
Let's discuss this. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES June 7, 2001 Notice No. 01-191 TO: ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT RE: EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the Friday, June 15, trading session. For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots. The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the accountability levels. These are: Any one month         All months Crude oil  10,000   20,000 Unleaded gasoline 5,000   7,000 Heating oil  5,000   7,000 Natural gas  7,000   12,000 Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped. There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts). These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract. These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email. 
The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t= he=20 terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll= =20 have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. = I=20 also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is= =20 traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20 Descriptions: Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel= y=20 clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i= n=20 the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin= e=20 something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20 Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the= =20 relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20 referring to the quality as well. Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -= =20 there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the= =20 GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes= =20 more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa= me=20 units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number= =20 some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.= =20 The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit= . =20 It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20 volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20 Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20 beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to= =20 the GTC. The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20 parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about= =20 this more than I.) If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I= =20 would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha= t=20 the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per= =20 month'. Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to = be=20 clear from the Long Description. So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with= =20 something like this: A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018= )=20 pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit= y=20 of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20 shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.

The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20 The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit= =20 per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per= =20 month.=20 If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b= e=20 more like this: A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P.

The number of= =20 DSO=01,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the= =20 Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Condition= s=20 will apply to this Transaction. =20 The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv= e=20 Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date.

Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve= =20 the product in the system so you can proceed without me if necessary. Mark Leonardo Pacheco@ENRON 04/27/2000 01:38 PM

The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t= he=20 terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll= =20 have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. = I=20 also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is= =20 traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20 Descriptions: Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel= y=20 clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i= n=20 the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  You are correct. If so, maybe we= =20 should add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS= -3=20 for this Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc= e=20 to the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20 sentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten= ce=20 of the long description to read "" A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20 Broadband Services, L.P. (""EBS"") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an= d=20 the Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20 Counterparty via the Website. Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t= he=20 industry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the= =20 long description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20 incredibly long, complex and technical.  If you feel strongly about it, we= =20 can include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you= =20 should include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20 necessary. The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -= =20 there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the= =20 GTC.  The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G= TC=20 (and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price= =20 is being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component= =20 of the ""Unit Price"" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to= =20 confuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20 description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit= =20 Price was calculated using the price quoted.  Unless industry trading=20 convention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the= =20 volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.  If the volume is=20 Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or= =20 perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.  The GTC contains the= =20 defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.  It seems to me tha= t=20 if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20 Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number = of=20 DSO miles for the transaction. =20 Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20 beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to= =20 the GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig= ht=20 to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20 (which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi= th=20 us.  This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted= =20 this fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20 costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation= =20 agreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process. The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20 parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about= =20 this more than I.) Agreed If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I= =20 would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha= t=20 the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per= =20 month'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20 Since the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20 offered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.  We are also a bit=20 sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo= ng=20 description.  From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20 language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate. Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to = be=20 clear from the Long Description.  If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3= =20 Bandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20 would be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.  I hope= =20 that this is responsive to your question - we weren't entirely clear. So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with= =20 something like this: A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018= )=20 pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit= y=20 of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.

I spoke to Kate Cole and she said Enron NetWorks (I'm not sure of the correct spelling yet) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on 4/13/00.  She has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and LLC Agreement and I am sending a messenger to pick them up, as well as a copy of the officers and directors, which appears to have been approved.  The banking resolution went to Julia today for signature.  Do we need to adopt any other resolutions (brokerage, approval of agreements, etc.).  How about adoption of the trading policy?

Thanks for your note.  In reply: 1.  We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section. 2.  and 3.  We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't provide for using securities as collateral.  As you point out, it is likely that SR will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited Threshold for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that document.   There are certainly other changes that could be made to the document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much since you would never have to post anything under this document. Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments. Mark ""Stephen Kruft"" <Stephen_Kruft@swissre.com> 05/31/2000 08:56 AM 
I looked at the EFR-ENA Schedule in connection with Gordon Boozer's comments.  I see no problems except: 1.  The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the""United Kingdom.""   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say ""England,"" as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g., Scottish) within the U.K. 2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent. 3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA? Regards

I have attached a final copy of the Media General Confirmation. 
The most recent news is that Carol has been admitted to the hospital and is 
Carol had the baby at 10:15 p.m. last night.  Charles Eugene St. Clair weighed 8lbs 8 ounces. Carol is in Methodist Hospital, Room 633 6565 Fannin Houston, TX Phone Number is 713-790-3867 
Just a reminder that when original documents are received on this transaction (which should be soon given that they went out Monday night), an original incumbency certificate for Media General should be included.  This should be delivered to Mark Taylor for his records.  Mark agreed to waive the requirement that the certificate be delivered at closing with the understanding that it would come promptly thereafter. Stuart 
Looks good to me. Taffy Milligan 07/28/2000 11:35 AM 
Please be advised, I am planning to take the week of Vacation, 8/7-11/2000, unless this creates a conflict within the group. I will notify, Brenda Whitehead so she can arrange coverage for my desk, as soon as I receive your approval. Thank you for your consideration. Taffy 
Mark, could you please review the attached CA from NextSet. we will not need to look at the LOI at this time. Please call me if this should be directed elsewhere or with any questions w/r/t  information below. Thanks George Zivic 3-7489 
If we can find an attorney in Houston, I would be all for moving forward with it.  The truth is that a 2 day delay will not ruin the relationship.  Since I am on vacation today and tomorrow, I would ask George to investigate Houston lawyers.  George I think we use Mark Taylor but please confirm this with Moazzam. Thanks. Gillian David Weekes 03/08/2000 03:03 
Gillian Apparently we are short of lawyers this week.  Will it be OK to get back on this next week or do you want to show it to a lawyer in Houston ? David 
Gillian Thanks - that makes sense.  I will get legal to look at the CA. David Gillian Johnson 02/08/2000 20:49 
George and I agree that we should not consider signing the LOI now, but should sign the CA so that we can share information and hold further discussions to jointly develop the nature of the relationship.  In the LOI sent, they are making declarations that we have not fully flushed out, therefore, we are not prepared to sign that. Hope that helps. Thanks. Gillian David Weekes 02/08/2000 12:50 
Gillian Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where the need for training will come in. I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ? Regards David Gillian Johnson 02/08/2000 16:03 
It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard of Jerry Peskuchi. Tana Jones 08/04/2000 09:16 AM 
Anyone know anything about this? 
Everybody, Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the status of the master. Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling this and pass the info on. 
Thanks for dealing with Tana on these issues.  It is not entirely clear to me what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to Australian power products.  You probably already know that the EnronOnline people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access. Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.  Unfortunately, that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.  It sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would be a total pain but certainly possible).  On the other hand, if you feel comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties  without that test being performed, we can do that, too.  Pleas let me know if we should ask Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be

Hi Mark- Hope all is well. Attached you will find an e-mail that I sent to Alan regarding ISDA documentation, for which I need approval from Houston.  Alan has informed me that he left you a voicemail on this subject and I was hoping you could provide me with guidance as to whom I should contact to obtain approval. By separate e-mail, I will be forwarding weather derivative GTC's for use on EOL with Enron Japan Corp. as the Enron counterparty.  Please also advise who I should be in contact with to obtain the requisite approval for these GTC's, as well. Best regards, John 
Alan- Attached hereto, are marked-up copies of the following ISDA documents (based on the US versions) which have been prepared using the credit worksheet for The Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Limited, in conjunction with B&M: ISDA Schedule, CSA and Enron Corp. Guarantee. The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted. It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other counterparties such as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.  I note that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa. Please note: 1.  There are still a number of ""options"" in the documents which I have not completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.  These are indicated in square brackets.  Please let me know how you would like to deal with these; 2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in the documents; 3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that appropriate counsel reviews same;and 4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common in Japan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties. Please let me know if you have any questions. Best regards, John 
I didn't think we were confirming transactions between books, but maybe this is a first that crossed company lines - I would think we would confirm it through RMT as one ENA RMT trade and another RMT EPMI trade.  I'm assuming that the reference to EPMI Long Term Hedge is an EnronOnline reference to one of the EPMI trading desks and therefore it should be done as an EPMI trade. Tana Jones 08/21/2000 04:14 PM 
Do you know what to do here? 
Susan/Tana, We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering the trade was ENA and the entity entering the trade was EPMI Long Term Hedge (Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect. Thanks, Joe 
Dear John: So sorry for the delay.  I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.  I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent: Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.  To accomplish this in the schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly. Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?  We rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.  The risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it.  In the U.S. the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge. Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the non-defaulting party the most flexibility.  Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature.  However, in many of the markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness). Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position.  If the party fails, it then becomes a default allowing termination. Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could happen? Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this? Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to.  Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.? The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary.  In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents, etc. Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind (although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).  If neither party is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.  On the other hand, since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well.  If that is our theory, there are additional representations (the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back in. Part 5 (d)  We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.  While I think we will get there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.  So far I guess we leave it the way it is. Part 5 (j)  My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.  Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about? Paragraph 13  I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 provisions as the Schedule.  My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like there's a glitch in the form.  It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.  The way it is drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.  The counterparty doesn't have to worry about Moody's at all.  Just a thought. On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.  My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra $5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded. Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form.  I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many. I hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful.  We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward.  It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.  It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things. We're looking forward to having you back.

Brent - does this mean Tana should not allow any non-Argentine customers to have access to these products?  The general rule has been to allow complete access unless there was a legal impediment - logic regarding who will want to trade what doesn't seem to enter into it. Tana Jones 10/20/2000 09:49 AM 
fyi 
Enron America de Sur S.A. is the enron entity set up to trade on EOL; Lisa Lees will manage the external customer access. Lynn Aven@ENRON 10/19/2000 04:26 PM 
Dale: I spoke with Jeff Bluementhal earlier today and wanted to confirm the parties that should be approved for trading Argentine.  The Enron party that should execute Argentine physical gas deals should be Enron America de Sur S.A.  It should be noted that all counterparties for this product should be Argentine entities.

Let's be sure to keep this in mind as we do future resolutions. 
I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows: 1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts. 2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed. 3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign. 4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp. 5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations. Please give me your comments. 
Lucy: Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties. There are a couple of general rules that apply to ""normal"" trading circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances vary (even just a little bit) from ""normal.""  For example, abnormal situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we are trading (except as spelled out below).  Having said all that, the following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines: 1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.  Of course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or can't be done by us from the U.S.). 2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to the master agreement.  If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other rules may apply. 3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of ECT International.  Note that there are special considerations if the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is actually ""arranged"" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT International).  If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two countries for final negotiation and execution.  It would be a good idea to consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice. These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal counterparty to the transactions.  This doesn't determine where within the Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.  If we want the risk to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) 
This one should go to the crude traders.

Here it is. 
The  emergence of web trading has important implications for deal clearing. Meetings are scheduled for November 16-17 to discuss these implications and to come to a consensus on a strategic solution for deal clearing. Please plan to attend or designate someone who can represent you. Attached please find a tentative schedule for the meetings. Additional information will follow. Please feel free to address any questions you might have  regarding these meetings to  Sarita Das ( 713 345-8232 ) or Ron Nolte ( 713 853-7569 ). 
My answers below in red. Bob Bowen 10/19/2000 10:39 AM 
I assume you have heard that EOL is soliciting HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com in order to increase their volume and market coverage.  The message below is from Ron Nolte, our IT person for the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent questions that may need your legal opinion. I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and set-up of EOL's discussions with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com. 
Just came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey Moorer informed everyone about the new venture between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered on EOL. I solicit comments from everyone. As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will magically appear. The party might think, ""Hey, I can't do better than this on EOL, I'll take this deal"".  The deal is transacted 
Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane. Alan Aronowitz 10/25/2000 04:16 PM 
Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. Please advise. Thanks. 
Agreed - can you please confirm directly with Erica that Tax has no problem with Enron Credit.com contracts being signed in the US. Tana Jones 10/26/2000 08:23 AM 
Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you need to talk to Erica...

Bob: Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere. The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.] For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or individuals - for similar reasons). Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot. Mark Bob Shults 12/12/2000 10:26 AM

It never ends. 
Bob: This communication is to keep everyone informed of the back office issues related to EOL trades with Aquilia The Aquilia office (Aquilia Energy) in Omaha contacted our Settlements team regarding the EOL day deals(invoices) stating that they were not Aquilia Energy or Aquilia Risk Deals but rather Aquilia Southwest deals.  Aquilia Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.  To ensure timely payment, Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk will be made by Aquilia Southwest.  Aquilia wanted us to change the counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed. Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues. Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the effort to getting the invoices to the correct office. I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.  I would like clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for Physical deals. Thanks, KC 
Gentlemen: Several points regarding the below: We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time. If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone in my group to get that process started. The e-mail from Dow indicates: ""TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included in the

Let's be sure to keep this in mind as we do future resolutions. 
I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows: 1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts. 2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed. 3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign. 4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp. 5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations. Please give me your comments. 
Just a reminder that when original documents are received on this transaction (which should be soon given that they went out Monday night), an original incumbency certificate for Media General should be included.  This should be delivered to Mark Taylor for his records.  Mark agreed to waive the requirement that the certificate be delivered at closing with the understanding that it would come promptly thereafter. Stuart 
Looks good to me. Taffy Milligan 07/28/2000 11:35 AM 
Please be advised, I am planning to take the week of Vacation, 8/7-11/2000, unless this creates a conflict within the group. I will notify, Brenda Whitehead so she can arrange coverage for my desk, as soon as I receive your approval. Thank you for your consideration. Taffy 
Mark, could you please review the attached CA from NextSet. we will not need to look at the LOI at this time. Please call me if this should be directed elsewhere or with any questions w/r/t  information below. Thanks George Zivic 3-7489 
If we can find an attorney in Houston, I would be all for moving forward with it.  The truth is that a 2 day delay will not ruin the relationship.  Since I am on vacation today and tomorrow, I would ask George to investigate Houston lawyers.  George I think we use Mark Taylor but please confirm this with Moazzam. Thanks. Gillian David Weekes 03/08/2000 03:03 
Gillian Apparently we are short of lawyers this week.  Will it be OK to get back on this next week or do you want to show it to a lawyer in Houston ? David 
Gillian Thanks - that makes sense.  I will get legal to look at the CA. David Gillian Johnson 02/08/2000 20:49 
George and I agree that we should not consider signing the LOI now, but should sign the CA so that we can share information and hold further discussions to jointly develop the nature of the relationship.  In the LOI sent, they are making declarations that we have not fully flushed out, therefore, we are not prepared to sign that. Hope that helps. Thanks. Gillian David Weekes 02/08/2000 12:50 
Gillian Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where the need for training will come in. I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ? Regards David Gillian Johnson 02/08/2000 16:03 
It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard of Jerry Peskuchi. Tana Jones 08/04/2000 09:16 AM 
Anyone know anything about this? 
Everybody, Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the status of the master. Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling this and pass the info on. 
Thanks for dealing with Tana on these issues.  It is not entirely clear to me what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to Australian power products.  You probably already know that the EnronOnline people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access. Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.  Unfortunately, that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.  It sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would be a total pain but certainly possible).  On the other hand, if you feel comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties  without that test being performed, we can do that, too.  Pleas let me know if we should ask Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be

Hi Mark- Hope all is well. Attached you will find an e-mail that I sent to Alan regarding ISDA documentation, for which I need approval from Houston.  Alan has informed me that he left you a voicemail on this subject and I was hoping you could provide me with guidance as to whom I should contact to obtain approval. By separate e-mail, I will be forwarding weather derivative GTC's for use on EOL with Enron Japan Corp. as the Enron counterparty.  Please also advise who I should be in contact with to obtain the requisite approval for these GTC's, as well. Best regards, John 
Alan- Attached hereto, are marked-up copies of the following ISDA documents (based on the US versions) which have been prepared using the credit worksheet for The Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Limited, in conjunction with B&M: ISDA Schedule, CSA and Enron Corp. Guarantee. The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted. It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other counterparties such as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.  I note that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa. Please note: 1.  There are still a number of ""options"" in the documents which I have not completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.  These are indicated in square brackets.  Please let me know how you would like to deal with these; 2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in the documents; 3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that appropriate counsel reviews same;and 4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common in Japan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties. Please let me know if you have any questions. Best regards, John 
I didn't think we were confirming transactions between books, but maybe this is a first that crossed company lines - I would think we would confirm it through RMT as one ENA RMT trade and another RMT EPMI trade.  I'm assuming that the reference to EPMI Long Term Hedge is an EnronOnline reference to one of the EPMI trading desks and therefore it should be done as an EPMI trade. Tana Jones 08/21/2000 04:14 PM 
Do you know what to do here? 
Susan/Tana, We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering the trade was ENA and the entity entering the trade was EPMI Long Term Hedge (Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect. Thanks, Joe 
Dear John: So sorry for the delay.  I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.  I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent: Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.  To accomplish this in the schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly. Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?  We rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.  The risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it.  In the U.S. the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge. Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the non-defaulting party the most flexibility.  Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature.  However, in many of the markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness). Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position.  If the party fails, it then becomes a default allowing termination. Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could happen? Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this? Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to.  Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.? The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary.  In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents, etc. Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind (although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).  If neither party is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.  On the other hand, since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well.  If that is our theory, there are additional representations (the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back in. Part 5 (d)  We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.  While I think we will get there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.  So far I guess we leave it the way it is. Part 5 (j)  My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.  Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about? Paragraph 13  I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 provisions as the Schedule.  My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like there's a glitch in the form.  It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.  The way it is drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.  The counterparty doesn't have to worry about Moody's at all.  Just a thought. On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.  My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra $5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded. Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form.  I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many. I hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful.  We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward.  It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.  It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things. We're looking forward to having you back.

Notice No. 00-362 October 25, 2000 
Here it is. 
The  emergence of web trading has important implications for deal clearing. Meetings are scheduled for November 16-17 to discuss these implications and to come to a consensus on a strategic solution for deal clearing. Please plan to attend or designate someone who can represent you. Attached please find a tentative schedule for the meetings. Additional information will follow. Please feel free to address any questions you might have  regarding these meetings to  Sarita Das ( 713 345-8232 ) or Ron Nolte ( 713 853-7569 ). 
The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t= he=20 terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll= =20 have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. = I=20 also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is= =20 traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20 Descriptions: Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel= y=20 clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i= n=20 the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin= e=20 something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20 Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the= =20 relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20 referring to the quality as well. Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -= =20 there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the= =20 GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes= =20 more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa= me=20 units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number= =20 some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.= =20 The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit= . =20 It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20 volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20 Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20 beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to= =20 the GTC. The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20 parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about= =20 this more than I.) If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I= =20 would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha= t=20 the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per= =20 month'. Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to = be=20 clear from the Long Description. So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with= =20 something like this: A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P.

I assume you have heard that EOL is soliciting HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com in order to increase their volume and market coverage.  The message below is from Ron Nolte, our IT person for the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent questions that may need your legal opinion. I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and set-up of EOL's discussions with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com. 
Just came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey Moorer informed everyone about the new venture between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered on EOL. I solicit comments from everyone. As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will magically appear. The party might think, ""Hey, I can't do better than this on EOL, I'll take this deal"".  The deal is transacted 
Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane. Alan Aronowitz 10/25/2000 04:16 PM 
Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. Please advise. Thanks. 
Agreed - can you please confirm directly with Erica that Tax has no problem with Enron Credit.com contracts being signed in the US. Tana Jones 10/26/2000 08:23 AM 
Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you need to talk to Erica... 
Tana Here is Erica's approval, as such - I have since explained what it is about and she is happy with it Thanks Mike 
Thanks for your quick reply.  My apologies for asking so many questions wit= h=20 obvious answers.  I hope I didn't waist too much of your time.

The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t= he=20 terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll= =20 have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. = I=20 also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is= =20 traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20 Descriptions: Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel= y=20 clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i= n=20 the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  You are correct. If so, maybe we= =20 should add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS= -3=20 for this Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc= e=20 to the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20 sentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten= ce=20 of the long description to read "" A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20 Broadband Services, L.P. (""EBS"") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an= d=20 the Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20 Counterparty via the Website. Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t= he=20 industry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the= =20 long description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20 incredibly long, complex and technical.  If you feel strongly about it, we= =20 can include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you= =20 should include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20 necessary. The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -= =20 there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the= =20 GTC.  The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G= TC=20 (and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price= =20 is being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component= =20 of the ""Unit Price"" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to= =20 confuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20 description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit= =20 Price was calculated using the price quoted.  Unless industry trading=20 convention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the= =20 volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.  If the volume is=20 Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or= =20 perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.  The GTC contains the= =20 defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.  It seems to me tha= t=20 if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20 Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number = of=20 DSO miles for the transaction. =20 Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20 beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to= =20 the GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig= ht=20 to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20 (which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi= th=20 us.  This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted= =20 this fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20 costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation= =20 agreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process. The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20 parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about= =20 this more than I.) Agreed If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I= =20 would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth= =20 Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha= t=20 the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per= =20 month'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20 Since the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20 offered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.  We are also a bit=20 sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo= ng=20 description.  From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20 language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate. Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to = be=20 clear from the Long Description.  If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3= =20 Bandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20 would be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.  I hope= =20 that this is responsive to your question - we weren't entirely clear. So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with= =20 something like this: A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018= )=20 pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit= y=20 of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20 shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.

The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20 The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit= =20 per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per= =20 month.=20 If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b= e=20 more like this: A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P.

Bob: Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere. The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.] For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or individuals - for similar reasons). Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot. Mark Bob Shults 12/12/2000 10:26 AM

Gentlemen: Several points regarding the below: We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time. If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone in my group to get that process started. The e-mail from Dow indicates: ""TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included in the

Marcus - I understand you are the new physical power online lawyer - lucky you! Here's one that the EOL people are anxious to get covered.  I'd be happy to sit down and go over exactly what all this means and you'll probably want to talk to Tana a bit as well. Mark 
Mark, Please take a look at this and advise me as to how I could move this forward for a Monday release. Kevin 
Kevin- I apologize for not getting back with you on this. I don't know if you know but I have resigned from Enron and have only a few days left. I am swamped with a lot of other work and I have asked my boss, Elizabeth Sager, to appoint a new atty to handle EOL matters (until Leslie Hansen returns). She can be reached on x36349. Thanks, Shari Stack Enron North America, Legal Department Tel: (713) 853-9477 Kevin Meredith@ENRON 03/09/2001 10:52 AM 
Please review the following attachment containing the proposed long description for the Physical Power Spread requested by Sean Crandall.  Sean has reviewed and approved the language for use on his product.  I will be setting this product up for testing once I receive word back from you. Thank you. Kevin 
I suggest you work through Matthew Dawson in the London legal department. They should be able to help you. Angeline Poon 03/16/2001 12:22 AM 
Hi Mark I would be grateful if you could please let us know which paralegal has been assigned to assist in the matter. We have just signed an ISDA Master Agreement with Caltex Trading Pte Ltd and the same has to be executed by an officer of Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. Many thanks Angie 
Hi Mark Please let me know which paralegal has been assigned to assist in this matter. Thanks. Regards Matt 
Sounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions: Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest? If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there - in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check. Peter Keohane 04/02/2001 07:02 PM 
Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an ""instrument"" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property Security Act, and an ""instrument"" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate further?  Peter.

Bill - If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty. Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system. My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed. In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know. Mark

CP/ID 94330, Cargill Ferrous International FYI... Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill, Inc. Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure. Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name. Best Rgds.

I'll be there! Tana Jones 05/01/2001 05:16 PM 
We will need to catch a cab to get to La Fogata which is located at 2427 Vance Jackson Road in San Antonio.  Our dinner reservations are for 7:00 pm, so I suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30 and catch group cabs together.  Dress is casual.  The phone number for the restaurant is 210-340-1337, in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar (this will have special meaning to certain swap group members!).  If you haven't RSVP'd back to me, please do so, so I can get an accurate head count for tomorrow. See you in San Antonio.

I spoke to Kate Cole and she said Enron NetWorks (I'm not sure of the correct spelling yet) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on 4/13/00.  She has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and LLC Agreement and I am sending a messenger to pick them up, as well as a copy of the officers and directors, which appears to have been approved.  The banking resolution went to Julia today for signature.  Do we need to adopt any other resolutions (brokerage, approval of agreements, etc.).  How about adoption of the trading policy? 
As you already know, it's that time again.  Since I am leaving on vacation Friday morning, please use the system to input your suggested reviewers no later than noon tomorrow (Thursday) so that I can approve them and get the process started before I leave.  Sorry for the inconvenience. 
Peter: My only concerns would be: (1) To the extent of any overlap in customers (which seems unlikely but it's happened here), we would want all of the transactions to be in the same entity for netting and setoff purposes. (2)  It's been a while since we've done any due diligence focused on retail financial transactions in Canada.  We are pretty restricted in that area in the US.  As I remember it, the new law and subsequent regulations we unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in Canada. (3)  If traders in the US might close one of these transactions with a Canadian counterparty or traders in Canada transacted with a US counterparty, they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between Enron Canada and ENA. Let me know if I can be of any help. Mark T. Peter Keohane 05/09/2001 03:28 PM 
Mark (and Mark) are there any concerns with Enron Direct Canada (EDC) (the mass markets retail affiliate, that is soon to be a subsidiary of EES) as opposed to Enron Canada (as wholesale affiliate of ENA) entering into financial transactions?  To date EDC has been entering into physical transactions only for gas and power under forms that have been developed based upon our wholesale physical contracts, Enron Direct UK's form, and compliance with the local regulatory requirements for retailers.  If EDC was to enter into financial transactions, they would tend to be papered under omnibus financial GTCs with EDC (as ISDAs would likely not be marketable). Of course credit would need to be obtained in advance, and the transactions are not booked until the counterparty executes the paper.  Please let me know. Peter. 
Ken Raisler will be here on Monday, May 21 to conduct several training sessions for the weather and steel trading desks.  If you can work it into your schedule, please try and attend one or more of these sessions.  Brent will have further scheduling details.

REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES 
Let's discuss this. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES June 7, 2001 Notice No. 01-191 TO: ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT RE: EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the Friday, June 15, trading session. For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots. The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the accountability levels. These are: Any one month         All months Crude oil  10,000   20,000 Unleaded gasoline 5,000   7,000 Heating oil  5,000   7,000 Natural gas  7,000   12,000 Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped. There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts). These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract. These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Thanks for your note.  In reply: 1.  We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section. 2.  and 3.  We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't provide for using securities as collateral.  As you point out, it is likely that SR will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited Threshold for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that document.   There are certainly other changes that could be made to the document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much since you would never have to post anything under this document. Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments. Mark ""Stephen Kruft"" <Stephen_Kruft@swissre.com> 05/31/2000 08:56 AM 
I looked at the EFR-ENA Schedule in connection with Gordon Boozer's comments.  I see no problems except: 1.  The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the""United Kingdom.""   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say ""England,"" as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g., Scottish) within the U.K. 2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent. 3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA? Regards

Bob: This communication is to keep everyone informed of the back office issues related to EOL trades with Aquilia The Aquilia office (Aquilia Energy) in Omaha contacted our Settlements team regarding the EOL day deals(invoices) stating that they were not Aquilia Energy or Aquilia Risk Deals but rather Aquilia Southwest deals.  Aquilia Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.  To ensure timely payment, Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk will be made by Aquilia Southwest.  Aquilia wanted us to change the counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed. Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues. Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the effort to getting the invoices to the correct office. I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.  I would like clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for Physical deals. Thanks, KC 
Lucy: Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties. There are a couple of general rules that apply to ""normal"" trading circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances vary (even just a little bit) from ""normal.""  For example, abnormal situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we are trading (except as spelled out below).  Having said all that, the following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines: 1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.  Of course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or can't be done by us from the U.S.). 2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to the master agreement.  If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other rules may apply. 3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of ECT International.  Note that there are special considerations if the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is actually ""arranged"" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT International).  If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two countries for final negotiation and execution.  It would be a good idea to consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice. These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal counterparty to the transactions.  This doesn't determine where within the Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.  If we want the risk to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) 
Thanks to the DC team - Well Done! Chris Long@ENRON 07/27/2000 04:34 PM 
Today we were successful in killing an amendment that was offered by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) in the House Banking Committee during its markup of the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000.  This amendment would have stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband).  The amendment failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12.  Rep. Ken Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment. In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction. Congress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the Rules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the bill later this week.  The Senate is still the unknown. Call me at any question - Chris 
Bradley: We have learned that two amendments will be offered tomorrow my Rep. Maloney: #1  - Strikes lines 15-25 from page 41 and the entire page 42 (these are the sections of HR 4541 as reported out of the Ag. Committee which address the exemption for all most non-agriculture commodities trade on an electronic facility. #2  - Request a comprehensive study on the President's working group, DOE, and FERC. We strongly oppose amendment #1 which intends to more heavily regulate the energy derivatives industry.  Please have Rep. Bentsen voice his opposition to this amendment.  My guess is that amendment #2 should and will be ruled non-germane, however this is not a compromise we would support.

I think your ""final"" office changed when your group changed - the East Origination/Gas Trading Group is in the southeast quadrant of the floor and they have given you 3882, just  four doors down the hall from where I am now.  The construction workers are gone for the day if you want to stop by and see it. Kay Mann@ENRON 11/10/2000 03:07 PM

As you are all aware, the legal department has grown significantly over the last several months.  While so far we have been able to find places for everyone to sit, we have not added significantly to the available file cabinet space on the floor.  In fact, a number of file cabinets are now in locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements. Please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office space and, after condensing, archiving and destroying as many as possible, give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader.  Once we have an accurate picture of our needs, we can come up with a plan to allocate the available file cabinet space.

Richard - do we have a policy regarding questions concerning pending litigation?  How should we handle these? Mark 
Mark, I would appreciate your comments on the following FAQ's, intended to be a guide for Louise/myself/PR in the event we take a media call regarding the injunction/lawsuit. Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please let me know. Any calls received from the media will be answered by Louise, or in Louise' absence, by myself, with PR in the room (Louise will be back in the office on Monday and I suspect it is very unlikely that we would receive any calls before then). Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline? A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff. Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop? A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements which Agency was involved in developing. Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop? A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements which Enron developed. Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency? A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without authorisation from Enron. Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit? A We are not releasing that information at this time. Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged the competitive lead of EnronOnline? A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined. Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies? A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very capable IT consultancy companies. Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided? A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual contributors. Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other companies looking to build something like EnronOnline? A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com. Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information into a public forum. A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our contractor does not seem to have been upheld. Q11 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction? A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information. Q12  If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you also filing a lawsuit? A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate.

It looks to me like another case of an obvious error (i.e. the counterparty should have known it was a mistake).  I'm afraid we've just been lucky that the numbers have been so far off - some day we're going to have one that is too close to call obvious. 
I've reviewed the PG&E trade in question again and the spread value is actually $4.62, rather than $9. Given the fact that a typical spread trade for Nat Gas is aroung 5 or 6 cents, I know that this correction is not much of a consolation, but I wanted to clarify the pricing nonetheless. Deal Number Q75763.1, .2 Leg 1 = 9.38 Leg 2 = 4.76 Spread valueon trade = 4.62 
My feeling is we stand by our confirmation - what do you think? 
Mark: This falls into your area.  I have spoke to William Kelly and advised that I am forwarding it to you. Thanks, Jeff 
On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 - March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM of revenue.

Sounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions: Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest? If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there - in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check. Peter Keohane 04/02/2001 07:02 PM 
Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an ""instrument"" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property Security Act, and an ""instrument"" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate further?  Peter.

Do any of you guys know about this deal? 
Mark, I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap. We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues. Cheers Scott Mark Evans 02/24/2000 08:55 AM 
Scott, in Cynthia's absence, can you allocate someone else from your group to oversee this? As you can see, we are in need of some immediate assistance on Whitewing. Did you get the chance to speak to Mike Jakubik about Margaux? Can you help out with Houston coordination or shall I just get on with it with Mark Taylor and Jeff Hodge? Thanks. Mark 
Ron/Trina/Ben, I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing and determine what the appropriate course of action is. As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram below. With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen. The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the definition of ""Indebtedness"" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level. More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective? If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time discussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Best regards, Stuart

Mark, I was thinking that it might be helpful for us to take Series 7 exam here in the US like our counterparts are taking SFA exam in UK. I did some initial research and found that our ""compliance"" group has to open an account with NASD (National Association of Security Dealers) in order to take the exam. I don't know whether we already have sunch an arrangement in US with NASD for our other groups. If we do, could you guide me to talk to the appropriate person. If we don't than please let me know and we will decide, whether it is worth pursuing further. Thanks and regards Moazzam 
Mark, Could yu browze thru the attached term sheet and let me know whether it can be modified in ways that address our issues. regards Moazzam 
I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the ""green book"" and my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the Independent Amount).  The theory there is that as the market moves against us, we are cushioned by our ""out-of-the-moneyness"" and will be able to ask for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in the money.  I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.  We need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the paralegals can suggest something?).  I suggest we add the following language (taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far we go out of the money: ""Credit Support Amount"" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as provided in the definition of that term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent Amounts. I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of

Justin Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME & SFA), MG Metal & Commodity Co Ltd (LME only). Rgds Jon Justin Boyd@ECT 31/07/2000 20:53 
Jon, Grateful if you could complete the picture for me and for Mark Taylor.    Is MG London Inc. the entity that is the Clearing Member of NYMEX + a Futures Commission Merchant and Commodity Trading Advisor?   Do any other (MG) entities have similar registrations, and if so, what are these? Thanks Justin 
Justin: Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have. I hope you're well and all my best to Fran. Mark

This may be pertinent. 
Jon, I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity? [Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & Cromwell paper] Thanks. Justin 
Looks like Justin has already contacted S&C. 
Gentlemen - please see below as well as the S&C memo attached.  I will also send you a related email later. Thanks. Justin 
We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to change MG's status. Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK ""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical solutions: 1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco Inc. 2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd (depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two). The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK and Switzerland. Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If you need any further information, please let me know. Many thanks.

Sparks Companies is an outside ag industry consultant that Gary and his group have retained.  Sparks has a Washington office, and two of the principals of that office are putting on a presentation for us in D.C. on Sept. 14.  The focus of the presentation is ag law and policy and where Sparks sees things going over the next two years. In addition to Gary and Elsa, Chris Long and Lisa Yoho of the public affairs department will attend, and I think it would be helpful for me to attend as well.  The presentation is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., so I should be able to fly up that day and return that evening. Please let me know your thoughts on this.  If you agree, I will have Brenda make travel arrangements for me.  Thanks -- Bob 
Sounds reasonable to me. Mary Cook 08/30/2000 02:04 PM 
Based upon discussions with Andrea Reed, the res of the swap will be the warrant itself, not the underlying stock.  The warrants are valued separately with a ""warrant model"" and carry a price of their own differentiated from, although affected by, the stock price.  I did not get into further detail on the specifics of the modeling.  The will provide us the number of warrants, the strike price as of August 3.  Otherwise they will work similarly to the stock based swap I think.  She said they do not plan to exercise them, but may sell them as warrants.  Let me know what you think.  Mary 
Is this something you are working on? 
hi mark -- this is a currency swap agreement for the pending condor follow-on offering.  could you have some one from your group take a look of this agreement?  we are printing the preliminary offering memo this friday and the deal closes toward the end of this month. thanks. 
FYI 
I have just received the letter SFA promised us.  SFA have accepted our argument that our proprietary bond and equity trading can be carried on in London through an unregulated UK entity.  The letter also states that SFA will not be applying their consolidated capital supervision rules to the unregulated entity, which they have the discretion to do. From a regulatory perspective this means we can move ahead at full speed to set up an appropriate Chinese Wall and then begin trading. Best regards 
I thought I might try to sum up.  It seems to me that we both need to finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of next week. 1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap structure including the credit and covenant package. 2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have one prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations are, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For example: (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee they were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may have a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank. (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law. (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable. (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to Enron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal opinions. (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable. (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed. (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be capable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements. (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent upon a final understanding of the swap structure. (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap structure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate ""fee letter"" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not clear as to how ""increased costs"" would be accounted for in the swap structure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those increased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be accommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes or through a separate indemnification in the ""fee letter"". (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the Bank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants package.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper as soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning. Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external expectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday morning. Regards,

I have spoken with Daivd Mitchell about the issue that I raised in my e-mail yesterday regarding which law would govern the ""perfection"" of our interest in cash collateral pledged to Enron North America Corp. by a Canadian counterparty and held by us in an account in the US.  David confirmed that while a New York/Texas court should apply US law for perfection purposes, there is a possibility that a court would say that the law where the pledgor is located would govern perfection.  Because of this uncertainty and because of the perfection issues under Canadian law regarding cash collateral, do you all agree that in our masters involving ENA and a Canadian counterparty that Cash is not an acceptable form of collateral? Peter, As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash as collateral.  In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such cash.  I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such cash proceeds are property of the estate. Let me know what you think.  My assistant is trying to set up a call with you, me and Shari to go through the other Canadian law issues that I raised in my e-mail to you yesterday. Carol

Bob: Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere. The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.] For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or individuals - for similar reasons). Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot. Mark Bob Shults 12/12/2000 10:26 AM

I think S&C is fine - they are helping us with CFTC issues related to online trading and Energy Desk.com seems somwhat related. Sara Shackleton 11/16/99 12:21 PM 
Per my voice mail.  Let me know what you think.  SS 
Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara 
Sara, I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise! Martin 
Paul, The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the Sweden and Finland. Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic? Martin 
Mark, I would like to contact you in order to follow up to your conversation of last week with Mr. Chuck Cerria regarding executing an ISDA between numerous Hess entities and numerous Enron entities.  Unfortunately, I do not have your phone number.  Could you either call me or e mail it to me? Thanks so much, Dana Dellacona 212-536-8133 
Francisco - Here is an ISDA that Peggy needs in connection with a project she is working on in Mexico.  Can you take care of this one?  It looks like it is a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps.  Sara can probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that would be ok. 
Mark Attached are some comments from Enron's outside counel on the draft ISDA Master Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier this week. Could you please advise who is reviewing this document and when their review might be completed. Thank you for your assistance. 
Attached is the email forwarding the draft swap agt with SG. Rogelio--please take a look at the docs required in Part 3-- some changes will need to be made I am sure to reflect that EEIM is a Mexican company--please fax me a markup with your suggested changes.  It looks like we are going to need Mexican Power of Attorney for CT Corp. for this agreement also. Carlyn--please look at the CT Corp. appointment letter and let me know if any hedging agt is contemplated to be included.  We may need a separate appointment letter for this document (see Part 5, clause (vi)) -- note also that the jurisdictional consent language is different than in the Loan Agt and most of the other IDB docs--I don't think we care but I will point it out to SG--they may want to conform the language to have the same court jurisdiction. Mike--on substantive issues, please call me when you get back into town and have a moment to talk.  I spoke with one of my partners in Houston who is much more familiar with swaps and he thinks it looks ok for the most part--I have only a few questions/comments for you. Thanks all!

Is this something you know anything about? 
Gentlemen: Several points regarding the below: We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time. If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone in my group to get that process started. The e-mail from Dow indicates: ""TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included in the

Sounds reasonable to me.  I'm afraid the difficult questions are the one you posed to Peter and whether or not Credit will agree. Carol St Clair 10/20/99 11:07 AM 
I have spoken with Daivd Mitchell about the issue that I raised in my e-mail yesterday regarding which law would govern the ""perfection"" of our interest in cash collateral pledged to Enron North America Corp. by a Canadian counterparty and held by us in an account in the US.  David confirmed that while a New York/Texas court should apply US law for perfection purposes, there is a possibility that a court would say that the law where the pledgor is located would govern perfection.  Because of this uncertainty and because of the perfection issues under Canadian law regarding cash collateral, do you all agree that in our masters involving ENA and a Canadian counterparty that Cash is not an acceptable form of collateral? Peter, As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash as collateral.  In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such cash.  I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such cash proceeds are property of the estate. Let me know what you think.  My assistant is trying to set up a call with you, me and Shari to go through the other Canadian law issues that I raised in my e-mail to you yesterday. Carol 
I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the ""green book"" and my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the Independent Amount).  The theory there is that as the market moves against us, we are cushioned by our ""out-of-the-moneyness"" and will be able to ask for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in the money.  I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.  We need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the paralegals can suggest something?).  I suggest we add the following language (taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far we go out of the money: ""Credit Support Amount"" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as provided in the definition of that term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent Amounts. I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of 
I thought I might try to sum up.  It seems to me that we both need to finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of next week. 1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap structure including the credit and covenant package. 2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have one prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations are, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For example: (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee they were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may have a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank. (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law. (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable. (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to Enron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal opinions. (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable. (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed. (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be capable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements. (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent upon a final understanding of the swap structure. (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap structure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate ""fee letter"" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not clear as to how ""increased costs"" would be accounted for in the swap structure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those increased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be accommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes or through a separate indemnification in the ""fee letter"". (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the Bank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants package.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper as soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning. Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external expectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday morning. Regards,

I have just received the letter SFA promised us.  SFA have accepted our argument that our proprietary bond and equity trading can be carried on in London through an unregulated UK entity.  The letter also states that SFA will not be applying their consolidated capital supervision rules to the unregulated entity, which they have the discretion to do. From a regulatory perspective this means we can move ahead at full speed to set up an appropriate Chinese Wall and then begin trading. Best regards 
Is this something you are working on? 
hi mark -- this is a currency swap agreement for the pending condor follow-on offering.  could you have some one from your group take a look of this agreement?  we are printing the preliminary offering memo this friday and the deal closes toward the end of this month. thanks. 
Sounds reasonable to me. Mary Cook 08/30/2000 02:04 PM 
Based upon discussions with Andrea Reed, the res of the swap will be the warrant itself, not the underlying stock.  The warrants are valued separately with a ""warrant model"" and carry a price of their own differentiated from, although affected by, the stock price.  I did not get into further detail on the specifics of the modeling.  The will provide us the number of warrants, the strike price as of August 3.  Otherwise they will work similarly to the stock based swap I think.  She said they do not plan to exercise them, but may sell them as warrants.  Let me know what you think.  Mary

Sparks Companies is an outside ag industry consultant that Gary and his group have retained.  Sparks has a Washington office, and two of the principals of that office are putting on a presentation for us in D.C. on Sept. 14.  The focus of the presentation is ag law and policy and where Sparks sees things going over the next two years. In addition to Gary and Elsa, Chris Long and Lisa Yoho of the public affairs department will attend, and I think it would be helpful for me to attend as well.  The presentation is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., so I should be able to fly up that day and return that evening. Please let me know your thoughts on this.  If you agree, I will have Brenda make travel arrangements for me.  Thanks -- Bob

Looks like Justin has already contacted S&C. 
Gentlemen - please see below as well as the S&C memo attached.  I will also send you a related email later. Thanks. Justin 
We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to change MG's status. Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK ""arranger"" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical solutions: 1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco Inc. 2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd (depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two). The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK and Switzerland. Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If you need any further information, please let me know. Many thanks.

Jon, I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity? [Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & Cromwell paper] Thanks. Justin 
Justin: Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have. I hope you're well and all my best to Fran. Mark

Justin Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME & SFA), MG Metal & Commodity Co Ltd (LME only).

Jon, Grateful if you could complete the picture for me and for Mark Taylor.

Do any other (MG) entities have similar registrations, and if so, what are these? Thanks Justin

Mark, I was thinking that it might be helpful for us to take Series 7 exam here in the US like our counterparts are taking SFA exam in UK. I did some initial research and found that our ""compliance"" group has to open an account with NASD (National Association of Security Dealers) in order to take the exam. I don't know whether we already have sunch an arrangement in US with NASD for our other groups. If we do, could you guide me to talk to the appropriate person. If we don't than please let me know and we will decide, whether it is worth pursuing further. Thanks and regards Moazzam

Sounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions: Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest? If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there - in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check. Peter Keohane 04/02/2001 07:02 PM 
Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an ""instrument"" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property Security Act, and an ""instrument"" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate further?  Peter.

Let's talk at our group meeting tomorrow about the changes we should be 
Gentlemen: Several points regarding the below: We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time. If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone in my group to get that process started. The e-mail from Dow indicates: ""TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included in the 
Mark- Please see the correspondence below regarding Dow Chemical' s desire to enter into an ISDA with us. Let us know who will be leading the charge from legal. Thanks, John John Viverito Phone (713) 345-7814 Fax       (713) 646-3490 e-mail John.Viverito@enron.com 
John/Mike, can someone contact Luis Antuna (name and number below) to discuss putting together an ISDA between Dow Chemical Co. and EGM. Thanks, Alan 
Francisco - Here is an ISDA that Peggy needs in connection with a project she is working on in Mexico.  Can you take care of this one?  It looks like it is a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps.  Sara can probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that would be ok. 
Mark Attached are some comments from Enron's outside counel on the draft ISDA Master Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier this week. Could you please advise who is reviewing this document and when their review might be completed. Thank you for your assistance. 
Attached is the email forwarding the draft swap agt with SG. Rogelio--please take a look at the docs required in Part 3-- some changes will need to be made I am sure to reflect that EEIM is a Mexican company--please fax me a markup with your suggested changes.  It looks like we are going to need Mexican Power of Attorney for CT Corp. for this agreement also. Carlyn--please look at the CT Corp. appointment letter and let me know if any hedging agt is contemplated to be included.  We may need a separate appointment letter for this document (see Part 5, clause (vi)) -- note also that the jurisdictional consent language is different than in the Loan Agt and most of the other IDB docs--I don't think we care but I will point it out to SG--they may want to conform the language to have the same court jurisdiction. Mike--on substantive issues, please call me when you get back into town and have a moment to talk.  I spoke with one of my partners in Houston who is much more familiar with swaps and he thinks it looks ok for the most part--I have only a few questions/comments for you. Thanks all!

Bob: Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere. The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.] For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or individuals - for similar reasons). Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their customers just as Brokers cannot. Mark Bob Shults 12/12/2000 10:26 AM 
Andy as we discussed Harry will begin contacting the Hedge Funds.  Caroline Abramo is starting to push the CTA's (for LME metals) and hedge funds (metals, energy etc) through the credit hurdles and legal.  Mark, you have visited this one before any comments? 
I think S&C is fine - they are helping us with CFTC issues related to online trading and Energy Desk.com seems somwhat related. Sara Shackleton 11/16/99 12:21 PM 
Per my voice mail.  Let me know what you think.  SS 
Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara 
Sara, I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise! Martin 
Paul, The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the Sweden and Finland. Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic? Martin 
Is this something you know anything about? 
Do any of you guys know about this deal? 
Mark, I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap. We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues. Cheers Scott Mark Evans 02/24/2000 08:55 AM 
Scott, in Cynthia's absence, can you allocate someone else from your group to oversee this? As you can see, we are in need of some immediate assistance on Whitewing. Did you get the chance to speak to Mike Jakubik about Margaux? Can you help out with Houston coordination or shall I just get on with it with Mark Taylor and Jeff Hodge? Thanks. Mark 
Ron/Trina/Ben, I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing and determine what the appropriate course of action is. As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram below. With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen. The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the definition of ""Indebtedness"" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level. More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective? If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time discussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Best regards, Stuart 
Michele: Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol: 1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I believe an additional 10-12 days). 2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence until December 31, 2000. Please let me know if there is anything else you need. Mark 
Julia sent me a copy of your memo following up on one of the questions asked at the session earlier this week.  I would like to ask a follow-up question: Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since 
Peter - We have thought about this from time to time.  Our primary concern has not been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because of the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible waiver of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or handled carefully.  These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls generally.  Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem. Mark Peter Keohane 05/31/2001 11:54 AM 
Mark, I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit's requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities (i.e. use of defined terms, currency specification, notice and delivery timing, notice addresses, etc.).  It seemed to me that the form they are using may have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is not a drafting exercise on a case by case basis.  Practically, to the extent that the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no substantive concern.  However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in commodity markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circumstances where their credit is getting ""tight"", I can see the lack of contractual compliance perhaps being problematic.  Can somebody in your group develop a template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under the Enron form, the ""industrial"" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.  Please call Russell, Bill or me to discuss.  Peter. 
Jeff & Carol: As you work through these issues, please remember that even though the Mexico commercial group may not plan to offer many of their own products and may not expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can articulate a compelling reason to restrict them. Mark Jeff Blumenthal 06/20/2000 11:53 AM 
Carol, I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime. Best regards, Jeff Carol St Clair                06/20/2000 11:15 AM 
Jeff: As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will be ENA. Carol

Can somebody in your group develop a template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under the Enron form, the ""industrial"" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.  Please call Russell, Bill or me to discuss.  Peter. 
Michele: Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol: 1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I believe an additional 10-12 days). 2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence until December 31, 2000. Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Jeff & Carol: As you work through these issues, please remember that even though the Mexico commercial group may not plan to offer many of their own products and may not expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can articulate a compelling reason to restrict them.

Carol, I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Jeff: As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will be ENA. Carol

Moses, Jesus and an old man are golfing. Moses steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in a water trap. Moses walks down, parts the water and chips the ball onto the green. Jesus steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in the water trap. Jesus just walks on the water and chips the ball onto the green. The old man steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and heads for the water trap. But just before it falls into the water, a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth. As the fish is falling back down into the water, an eagle swoops down and grabs the fish in its claws.  The eagle flies over the green, where a lightning bolt shoots from the sky and barely misses it. Startled, the eagle drops the fish.  When the fish hits the ground, the ball pops out of its mouth and rolls into the hole for a hole-in-one. Jesus turns to the old man and says, ""Dad, if you don't stop fooling 
Mark, All systems ready to go on Friday morning.  I thus expect to be in the office on Monday morning (18 Jan.).  Could you please ask one of the assistants to help in organising and setting up a working station (computer and the rest of the requisite gear).  Also, since it is a bit tricky to establish contact with Houston H/R, this person could perhaps arrange a card/badge for me and a car parking ticket (or advise me where to put the car on Monday morning). I'm looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the Legal Dept on 18 Jan. Martin

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very quickly. The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review prior to going live. The intent is to capture as much of the corporate credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new mediums for communication.    To this extent, any ideas that you might have for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know. This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading initiatives. We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and customer base. ---------------------------------- This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be privileged and confidential.

Thanks for your Christmas letter.  It was good to see how Celena has grown! I'll be back in NYC Jan. 6 & 7 - any hope for dinner or at least a drink on Thurs. eve.?  My flight is scheduled to get in around 6:45 pm. 
Mark, You might want to check with Paul on this.  How have we arranged our IPE trading?  Since we are talking about exchange-traded contracts here, not dealing with customers, it may be possible to use an entity other than EEFT. Hope all is well. Mark Mark Elliott 01/04/2000 07:56 AM 
Bob, Apologies for not having got back to you sooner but I have only today returned from two weeks holiday to find your e-mail awaiting me! Anyway, I have already put in a call to Derek Oliver (whom I know quite well, having negotiated the legal documentation for our first Pulpex application) to be told that he is out of the office but that he will return my call. My initial thoughts, however, - and the main reason why I need to speak to Derek - is that, as you know, all financially-settled derivatives are (for regulatory reasons) arranged in London by Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited (EEFT) (rather than Enron Europe), which arranges deals for ECTRIC. I am unsure without speaking to Derek whether the Exchange will allow for EEFT to be a member of the Exchange as an agent (rather than as a principal) for ECTRIC.  EEFT never enters into deals itself as principal, and ECTRIC can only entre into deals via EEFT. Anyway, let me have a word with Derek and see what we can come up with. I shall be in touch as soon as I have spoken to Derek. Kind regards and happy New Year, Mark Bob Crane 21/12/99 15:52 
Mark, Steve Kim has been working with me in Houston where one of his roles is PULPEX trading on a day-to-day basis.  He will be moving to London in late January to assist in our European marketing efforts.  I would like him to be able to trade PULPEX from London when he is not on customer calls.  My intent is the account would remain with Enron North America and Steve would trade as a back-up when no one is available in the US.  I have spoken with PULPEX about this and their legal department wants us to organize it where: Enron Europe would be a member of the exchange There would be a give-up agreement between ECTRIC and ENA where trades executed by Europe would automatically be transferred into ENA's accounts The exchange thinks this should be easy to set up from a legal perspective and Derick Oliver at 171 815 8502 to initiate the necessary docs.  Please let me know what you think. Regards, Bob Crane 
Louise - If you are back in Houston I'd like to get together and discuss the credit derivatives project.  Otherwise, maybe we can chat by phone? 
I see what you mean.  Another thing we need to consider is whether or not this is part of our market maker status for the exchange - do you know if Bob wants Steve's activities in London to be part of that? Mark Elliott 01/04/2000 11:41 AM 
Mark Thanks for your message.  Apparently, EEFT is the Member of IPE as a principal - but always acts through brokers when placing orders for ECTRIC (i.e., never places orders itself on the Exchange).  I'm not sure that Bob would want to have Steve place orders through brokers for ECTRIC rather than being able to trade on the Exchange himself.  I'll know more once I chat to the Exchange about the potential ways forward. Kind regards Mark

I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem getting one for them. Nony Flores 01/05/2000 02:50 PM 
Mark:  I'm not sure if Janice had the opportunity to talk to you about the point of attaching GTC's to on-line confirms or not; however, since she is on vacation this week and we started trading liquids on-line today, Alan suggested that I contact you and find out the outcome of this ongoing question.  Do we attach GTCs to each confirm that's sent out to the EOL counterparty? Thanks. Nony 
I have not had any discussions with Mark Taylor on the point of attaching GTCs. I don't know why it has been determined to be appropriate to do the attachment. Please consult with Mark on this and let me know what you find out. Thanks. Alan

I agree completely, have talked to the Mayors Office - Citizens' Assistance Office, the Traffic & Transportation Dept. (who gave me Ms. Dorsey's name) and have written to Ms. Dorsey.  I suggest you also complain to our City Council member and the other at-large members.  Since Dorsey is the Bikeway Coordinator, she won't have much incentive to do away with a designated bikeway but Council members want our votes: GABRIEL VASQUEZ gvasquez@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us - I think he represents the Heights ANNISE D.

Another argument for two lanes on Heights is that with only one lane, some percentage of traffic will divert itself to side streets making them less safe for residents there. And p.s. the argument that this lane is designed for use by bicycle commuters is particularly empty since the lane doesn't go anywhere - there's no connecting route at either end that I am aware of - do they expect all these 
Martin: My assistant, Jan Dobernecker, tells me that Sylvia Sauseda has arranged for an office for you here on the 38th floor.  The room number is EB3850.  Sylvia is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office and will talk to HR about a badge.  HR should have the badge waiting for you at the desk in the lobby when you arrive.  If it isn't and your HR person is not available, just call Jan Dobernecker at x33427 and she will tell them to let you in.  Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you.  If you haven't heard from her by Friday, I suggest you park in any of the uncovered lots near the building on Monday morning.  They are more reasonably priced than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you don't have a contract).  We're looking forward to seeing you! Have a good trip.

I guess the down-side of a 2 year old is that she may already have a fairly well formed personality, but the up-side is they will know she is healthy and she is still young enough to learn a new language easily.

January 7, 2000 Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85 A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES | NEWS | SPORTS | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ENTERTAINMENT Filed at 3:21 p.m. EST By The Associated Press LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers, has died. He was 85. O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book for several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not given and there were conflicting reports of the date. The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but newspapers and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday. O'Brian had lived in France since 1949. O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars. A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to evoke a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic jets and smart bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of sea battles fought under sail. The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the story of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack Aubrey, and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and secret agent who doesn't much like sailing. Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they achieved wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical fiction'' genre in which they generally were reviewed. In 1991, a New York Times critic called O'Brian ``the best novelist you have never heard of.'' ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, praising ``the intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the plotting, and the brilliance of the writing.'' O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, specialist language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement as a man-of-war turns to engage the enemy. A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, but O'Brian didn't think definitions important. ``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he once said. ``Explanation almost certainly would be.'' O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley, a former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's ``originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of (history) to invent a new style of fiction.'' ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has described the whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet lyrical accuracy.'' O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted questions about his personal life. He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, and it wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily Telegraph said in an obituary Friday. The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but changed his name in 1945. During his school years, he was frequently ill, spending much time reading. His writing career began at age 15, when he published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow leopard. During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly with Britain's Political Intelligence Department. In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern France. His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956, about a Pacific expedition. O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in Britain by the beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the American publisher W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight home. The rest, as they say, is publishing history. Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 20th book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily Telegraph reported. O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. A linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone de Beauvoir and Colette. O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995. Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard,

This will summarize our conversation this morning in which you asked if there was a problem with your purchase of an equity investment (through a private placement) in an internet/communications company.  My response was that Enron prohibits the trading by employees of (i) any security on the Restricted List maintained by the Compliance Group, (ii) any security, instrument or commodity within that employees area of responsibility and (iii) any energy commodity.  I suggested that you contact Donna Lowry to confirm both my understanding and that the security in question is not on teh Restricted List. While I did not mention it on the phone, I should point out that it would be unwise to take a position in a competitor of Enron's that would (or might in the future) give you control or the appearance of control or influence over

It could alos serve the purpose perhaps of catching up with them on the latest issues.  Let me know what you think.

This letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying those provisions which are subject to the masters.  In my view there are really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.  Most of the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.  In one case I had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty's lawyer, paragraph by paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow the master to control.  The only sections we had to amend were the first sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of section 6(e).  And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or another. Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and use of the website.  In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like ""Except as set forth under paragraph 3.(b) and (c) below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe master agreement shall prevail. If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to ""The agreements listed beloweach comprises a"" or better yet ""Each agreement listed below is a"" rather than ""The agreements listed below comprise the"". David Forster 01/11/2000 12:15 PM 
Mark, I would appreciate your opinion on the attached. Can you have a look and let me know what you think? Thanks, Dave 
Dave, I'm trying to reach agreement with PowerGen re: EOL trades - they are still very concerned with the overriding effect of the ETA, and will not accept our position. However, I have managed to get somewhere..........and I attach a draft I propose to send to their lawyer.  This is I believe as far as we can get with PowerGen (I did speak to him and I don't think he will go any further than as set forth in the draft).  The key point for me was to get PowerGen to agree (which I think they will) that the short + long descriptions [key elements of any trade] prevail over the master. Thoughts, comments please.... My view - if PowerGen agrees the draft, that should give us sufficient comfort... Thanks Justin 
We need to revise the Counterparty Matrix procedures.  Counterparties with a North American financial master agreement should only map to North American financial products (including all weather and paper transactions). Therefore, please revise the counterparty matrix to reflect that those counterparties with a North American master map to GTC's for European derivative transactions.  Please call me or Tana if you have any questions. Thanks! 
Thanks very much Anita - that makes good sense to me.  I'll coordinate through QD. Anita Fam 01/12/99 09:19 PM 
Hi Mark - Julia Deans from the QD Singapore office  got in touch with me this morning. Apparently Warren is in Tokyo on a work assignment until February so it won't be so easy to meet up with him as we'd hoped.  Warren  offered to  try and fly into Singapore this weekend to meet the 3 of us but I told Julia that I'd have to confer with you first when Houston opens today.  However,  following that conversation, Julia's note (see below)  came in. Seeing that Warren will be in your 'vicinity' next month - it certainly makes far more sense for him to wend his way to Houston in February so I shall tell Julia to shelve Warren's initial offer to fly into Singapore this weekend. I will forward Warren's academic details to you upon receipt from Julia. Thanks, Anita 
Dear Anita, It was good to talk to you this morning and I hope we will meet in person soon.  In the meantime, I wanted to let you know that Warren Simmons will be on vacation for two weeks beginning in early February.  He is planning to go to New York City so could make himself available for a meeting in Houston relatively easily. I will forward Warren's academic information to you later today.  If you need any other information in the meantime, please do not hesitate to let me know.  Our contact details are below.

Hey guys! Wow - 10 acres - sounds like a ranch!  I'm still working at Enron in Houston - it's a good size energy company and the subsidiary I work for does a lot of trading of electricity and energy commodities like natural gas and oil.  I'm in the legal department and work on derivatives trading contracts and issues.  I just got promoted a few days ago so I guess things are going well. I had an e-mail from Paul Palmer a year or so ago and sent a note back but haven't heard from him since.  Mark Kopinski & I stay in touch - he's in New York managing a couple of international mutual funds.  He & Debbie adopted a little girl (Celena) from China and seem very happy living in a high-rise in the middle of Manhattan.  I get up there on business a few times a year and try to stop in to say hi. I was in Monmouth for our 20 year class ""reunion"" last June.  There were only 2 of us there and I didn't even remember the other guy!  Oh well, maybe the 25th will be a bigger draw. C.F.&S., 
Would you guys please take a look at this and let me know what sorts of restrictions you would suggest we try and put on these guys and what sorts of legal disclaimers/notices should be on the site? Thanks, Mark

Mark - Mike Robison and I have finalized the form of GTC's for ECFC and are forwarding them to you for further distribution.  Thanks. John - The only modifications to ECFC's online GTC's are as follows: Contract Formation In order to maintain consistency with the other product lines online GTCs, we've modified this section to reflect the same introduction as reflected in ELFI, EGLI, ERAC and EPC. Damages and Limitation We've added a 2 line bilateral provision regarding payment. Financial Information We've added the two paragraphs re credit provisions as reflected in the confirmations. Compliance with U.S. Laws We've added the buyer/seller trade sanctions as reflected in the confirmations. Law and Jurisdiction We replaced this section in its entirety with the new policy in effect as of June 1998. Appendix II We've added the Marine Provisions Addendum. Appendix III We've added the Transportation Addendum. Thanks. Nony Flores Ext. 37541 Dale Neuner on 01/12/2000 05:24:45 PM 
Mark - Although these products were not on the release list for the Jan 5 release, we have been actively pursuing their completion and posting to EOL. Since our reviews of the products are complete, the Petrochems guys are extremely eager to have their products posted. Please offer your approval of the attached ASAP so I can get this and the product onto EOL. Nony - We were expecting delivery of the Methanol GTC today. Please be aware that the uploading of GTC's can sometimes be laborious, and since the Petrochem guys are eager to get this out, time is of the essence. Please let me know when you can expect delivery of the Methanol GTC to Mark Taylor. Dale Nony Flores 01/11/2000 06:09 PM 
Mark - Last week Dale Neuner was requested to add four new commodities to on-line trading and Mike Robison and Steve Elliott have reviewed and approved the long descriptions for benzene, mixed xylene, toluene and methanol.   We have also finalized the form of GTC's for EPC (who trades benzene, xylene and toluene) and are forwarding them to you for further distribution. Note:  GTC's for Enron Clean Fuels Company (who trades methanol) will follow on Wednesday. Thanks. Nony Flores Ext. 3-7541

Scott: The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up in court in a jurisdiction in Europe. Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London. Thanks, Mark Scott Sefton 01/11/99 04:08 AM 
My sense is that the market custom here is to use the English courts, not arbitration. I think the English commercial court judges are pretty sophisticated and would be able to work through the issues. Since Paul is out this week, I haven't had a chance to speak to him about this. Let's wait to hear his views when he returns to the office. Thanks! 
Richard: In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts (where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it. Thanks, Mark 
Don't be too hard on him just yet.  Remember that we talked about many similar issues here when they first came up.  Maybe after we've been through these with him once he will negotiate them in the first case and only bring the tough sticking points to us. Louise Kitchen 01/17/2000 02:25 PM

Memo 
NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT, THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGAL DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below.) Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page ""Executive Summary of Legal Advice"" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are ""all clear"" from a legal perspective, so as to keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take. A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be delayed Canada, Germany (reasons set out below) C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries) The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature: (i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies to almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade). The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particularly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally. (ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not include formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include (a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Without such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that entity for breach of confidence. D.  Country Specific Issues (i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter. (ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially. (iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a ""substantial professional effort"" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type. (iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty (which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  However, I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue. (v)  US (New York Law) (a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under the US Commodities Exchange Act. (b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a ""security"" under US securities laws (please see attached Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to ""accredited investors"" which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should not impede the business. (c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security (see (b) above) is relatively remote. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------- Please feel free to call me on x36566 if you would like to discuss this project further. Best regards Paul 
Just so you know what may be coming, I have spent roughly half of my time in the office over the last six weeks negotiating these sorts of requests.  It is very time consuming.  My comments below in red. Best of luck and feel free to call with any issues. Mark Louise Kitchen 01/17/2000 02:25 PM

PA They wish to amend the PA such that: Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause them to breach any third party rights Does this mean that Enron's use does not violate third party rights or Eastern's?  This doesn't really make sense to me:  if it is Enron's use then that's our problem and I don't see Eastern's concern and if it is Eastern's use that should be their problem, not ours - how will we know what arrangements they have in place with third parties?  No one else has raised this issue - is this something that is particularly of concern in the UK? they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their learning of the same. When they notify us is not an issue - as long as they understand that they will be liable for anything that happens with their passwords - whether authorized or not. they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time What is there in the PA that would prevent them from telling us about changed information? ETA They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron (see 1(iii))  This language refers to a variety of language on the site - including things like the submission screen, the Mater User's abilities to restrict sub-user id's, the long descriptions, etc.  It is simply not possible to create a list of every single item on the website that controls how the site is used and contracts are created.  This is one they will just have to live with.  They have to give their traders the credit to read what they are doing and if they don't like it they can stop trading. They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see last sentence of 2(b))  I think 2(b) already limits our use of the information to ""Enron"" which is defined pretty much as Enron and its affiliates.  Are they asking for more than that?  You can point them to section 5 which severely limits what we can do with confidential information. They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal EOL is not set up to allow one entity to trade on behalf of another.  How would we ever know who our counterparty really was?  If they want to trade for several counterparties, they need to fill out a separate PA (and separately click on the ETA) for each legal entity.  They should subsequently restrict the sub-user id's for each of those entities to trade only the products appropriate to that entity. To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e))  We have agreed that we will continue to furnish confirmations where we have a master agreement in place that calls for us to send confirms.  I've had a number of counterparties ask for this and have explained that even when there is not a master in place, in most cases we intend to continue to send confirms.  In fact, it is our intention (and the instructions you and I have received from Louise in no uncertain terms) that the trading should look as close as possible to its current form.  That includes contractual terms and the sending of confirms. Having said all that, the commercial people look forward with fondness to a time when confirms will become electronic and therefore this language was put in the ETA.  I would be surprised if, should we ever reach such a time, we would refuse to send confirms to those counterparties stuck in the dark ages of ""blue ink on dead trees.""  Given the frequency with which this on comes up, I wonder if future versions of the ETA should omit the offending language. They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful default/negligence/omission.  This strikes me as a non-starter.  The best we can do is to exclude damage we suffer by reason of our own gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct.  If they want to be without risk, they can continue to use the phone. They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)).  They can stop trading at any time and do not need to terminate the agreement.  We have agreed on rare occasions that we will deactivate their password if we receive written notice from them requesting deactivation.  I have suggested that they might feel more comfortable giving the Mater User ID and password to someone in their control group so that they don't have to worry about the trader leaving and taking the important password along.  The Master User can always turn off a sub-user immediately.  I'm uncomfortable with the delivery issue since I usually don't get ""notice from the system of delivery"" when I send an e-mail.  Even if return receipts were always used, I don't know that they always work and I wouldn't want the counterparty to be able to prevent our giving notice simply by refusing to open our e-mails.  Certainly no one would successfully assert that an e-mail notice was effective unless properly addressed.  On the other hand, to be practical, if the issue is critical, we will not be relying on an e-mail notification in any event and I can understand their concern that someone might be on holiday when the e-mail is received - not as big an issue with a fax or letter that can be easily opened by someone else. Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points. Please let me know what you think - thanks In some cases you just have to wait these guys out.  I know the traders are anxious to get people online and trading, but remember that the same is true on the other side.  Luckily for us, Louise is willing to back us up on this and tell our counterparties to just sit back and watch the rest of the world get the good prices if they don't like our agreements.  In several cases, counterparties who have called with difficult legal departments like this ultimately just went ahead and clicked on the thing to start trading. Justin

I have gone ahead and forwarded this and the ECFC version to the EOL people to be uploaded. I do have a concern though that I wanted to ask you about. These GTC's use the defined term ""Commercial Term"" which is defined as follows: ""Commercial Terms"" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law that is issued in connection with a Transaction. We have taken the position in our other EOL trading that the transaction is complete and binding from the time we accept the counterparty's offer over the system by reference to the GTC, the numbers submitted by the counterparty (usually volume and price) and the Long Description.  We've gone to some lengths to make sure that the combination of GTC, website numbers and Long Description contain all of the necessary terms.  It's not clear to me that we intend the website numbers and Long Description to satisfy the definition of Commercial Terms.  Are these transactions not intended to be binding until the confirmation is signed?  Any thoughts on this? Nony Flores 01/11/2000 06:09 PM

We have an opening for a paralegal in the Financial Trading group.  In the past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the Legal Dept. who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms who might be willing to move.  Please give this a little thought and if you know of a good paralegal in town, let me or Tana Jones know so we can contact them. Thanks for you help.

However, it should be recognized that, by= =20 requesting consent, Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as= a=20 Reference Entity in the absence of consent. 3. Chinese Wall =01* We understand that it will not be feasible to construc= t a=20 complete =01&Chinese Wall=018 between the operations related to the Product= and=20 Enron=01,s other trading activities.  This is due primarily to the fact tha= t=20 activities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as= =20 Enron=01,s other trading activities.  However, Enron should implement a mod= ified=20 Chinese Wall between the trading operations.  This approach would enhance= =20 Enron=01,s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety= or=20 breach of duty by facilitating Enron=01,s ability to demonstrate that=20 information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the=20 Product. This could be accomplished through a number of procedures. ? First, Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical=20 separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc= t,=20 on the one hand, and Enron=01,s other trading activities, on the other hand= . =20 Even if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as= =20 other traders, it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the= =20 floor set off by partitions or similar features. ? Second, procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio= n=20 between Product traders and other traders if such information is material t= o=20 the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public=20 domain.  In addition, all trading personnel should be instructed with respe= ct=20 to the procedures through training programs. ? Finally, senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit= or=20 communications between the groups of traders and to review and make=20 determinations on requests by traders to communicate information that would= =20 otherwise be prohibited under the procedures.  These procedures will be=20 similar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron=01,s equ= ity=20 trading activities. 4. Restricted List -- Enron should establish and maintain a =01&restricted = list=018=20 of those entities on which Products may not be traded. ? Initially, the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i= s=20 not feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its=20 relationships with such entities; e.g., those entities with respect to whic= h=20 Enron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their= =20 inclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives=20 material, non-public information.  In addition, those entities with which= =20 Enron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to = be=20 excluded, depending on the terms of such agreements. ? Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of=20 information regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed. =20 Pursuant to these procedures, Enron should suspend the listing of quotation= s,=20 and therefore the issuance of new Products, with respect to a Reference=20 Entity, if Enron is in possession of material, non-public information=20 regarding such Entity of a type, or in situations, that render suspension= =20 necessary or advisable.  This would include situations in which Enron is=20 considering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity.  I= n=20 addition, the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud= ed=20 or deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron=01,s possession of information as= =20 well; e.g., where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with=20 respect to such Entities.=20 ? The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for= a=20 Product held by a counterparty, if the counterparty specifically requests= =20 Enron to do so.  The procedures should also address the pricing of the=20 closing transaction, however, and establish a mechanism for such pricing th= at=20 minimizes Enron=01,s potential exposure to liability as a result of its=20 effecting a transaction while in possession of material, non-public=20 information.=20 ? Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel, which should= =20 include instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi= th=20 any notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the= =20 restricted list.=20 As noted, we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew, which wi= ll=20 need to be integrated into Enron=01,s existing policies and procedures.  In= =20 addition, as we have advised you in our prior memoranda, there are no=20 procedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities=20 arising in connection with its offering of the Product.  However, the=20 implementation of the types of procedures described above should assist Enr= on=20 in mitigating such risks and defending against claims that might be made by= =20 Reference Entities. Please call us if you have questions on these or other issues. =20 K.M.R.=20

I tried to send this to your juno address and it came back.  Just in case you are home, I also received the following from the PR department a few minutes ago: Be sure to watch Chairman and CEO Ken Lay on Fox News today.  He will appear on ""Our World"" with Neil Cavuto at 4:30 p.m. CST to discuss Enron's year-end financial and operating highlights.

Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls. My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity. We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities as soon as possible. Bryan Seyfried 01/19/2000 06:35 AM 
Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them. As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties. Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies for the miscommunication. Call me if you want to discuss further. bs 
Mark - I forgot to copy Dale Neuner on my message to you yesterday afternoon.  Have you already forward it to him the revised GTC's?  If not, I'll be glad to do it. Thanks. Nony 
Mark - We forwarding the revised GTC's for EPC and ECFC correcting the definition of Commercial Terms in Appendix I as follows: We've deleted this definition: ""Commercial Terms"" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law that is issued in connection with a Transaction. and added the following new definition which mirrors the wording of Section 1.1 of the online GTC: ""Special Terms and Conditions"" means the special terms and conditions of a particular Transaction for the sale or purchase of Products, including but not limited to, payment terms, price, quantity/tolerance, Products description, specifications, delivery location and delivery window shall be as set forth on this website (""Special Terms and Conditions""); We've also made a global change to the entire document replacing ""Commercial

It sounds like it may be a little while before the IT group gets the final approval to move the web site to the outside.  In the mean time, is it worth while to send Sullivan&Cromwell print outs of the pages?  Right now there is not really much info on the site.  We can identify third party links, the type of information we will be providing as well as sources for our data. Will this be of use? Mike 
I have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel (Sullivan & Cromwell in NY) can't.  Any way for them to get access so they can advise us on this?  They are also the guys who will help with a training session on various legal issues and company policies in trading. Michael Etringer 01/14/2000 05:00 PM 
Mark, As discussed, here is the URL for the proposed web site: http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/ It is still on an internal server which I hope you will have access to.  Let me know if it doesn't work. The User ID is: ""user1""  and the Password is:  ""test""  . I also ran through several of the web sites from which we gather our information and did not run across the occurance of any copyright statements. In terms of timing, we hope to release the site by the end of January to a limited customer listing. Regards, Mike Etringer 503-464-3836 
Is it possible to pinpoint the sources of the rumors we discussed yesterday? If so, it might be possible to maintain an action against the culprits.  I'm not sure exactly what it might be - possibly for slander or tortious interference with contract, something like that.  I could discuss it with our friend Richard Sanders but it would be a waste of time if we can't identify

The vacation time looks good to me.  My trip is nowhere near final yet so let's hold off on rescheduling the credit group lunch. Don't come back until you're well! Carol St Clair 01/20/2000 01:21 PM 
Mark: The credit group lunch is scheduled for the 18th of February.  Do I need to reschedule?  Also, were you okay with my vacation request of March 22-24th? I hope to be back in the office tomorrow although I have signed up for a CLE seminar at the Hyatt. Carol 
Thursday January 20, 4:51 pm Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: Enron Corp. Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference; Provides Business Overview and Goals for 2000 HOUSTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - news) hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in Houston. Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the conference by highlighting Enron's tremendous growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade. Enron presented key objectives for 2000: Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses. Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services. Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services. Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a recurring theme throughout the day. Wholesale Energy Business Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, Enron's largest business. Wholesale energy growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity provider in March 2000. EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are generated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000 transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction methods. Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with expansions planned or underway on several of its systems. Retail Energy Services With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place to service customers worldwide. As the strong contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services' goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and energy services, nearly double the level in 1999. Enron Broadband Services The new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network controlled by software intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network is widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to Internet service providers, thus providing the platform for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery. A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills from its energy businesses, bandwidth intermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also provide premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with differentiated levels of quality in a usage-based business model. As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun Microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Internet services. Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications companies. The company, which owns approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ``ENE.'' This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include political developments in foreign countries, the ability to penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband services markets, including the energy outsource market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of changes in interest rates, the timing and success of Enron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, communications, internet- related and other infrastructure projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the periods covered by the forward looking statements.

I should be here.  Nella can set something up with Taffy. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp. 
I don't see any problems.  It will become more challenging as we start thinking about trading. 
Mark: Apparently our people are already working with Louise Kitchen.  The issue I described yesterday is described below.  Basically we want to make reference to Enron Online in an informational site we will possibly be participating in Colombia.  Please let me know if you see any problem with this. Thank you. FPL 
FYI, cont. 
I talked to Louise Kitchen (MD Enrononline) about how our group could leverage on  enrononline for  our plans of a first step with an informational site in Colombia  to move  later to a transactional site as Enron stars trading activities in Colombia. What I proposed to Louise is to  get  ISA to include enrononline in the ""other sites of interest"" data  for  Colombia and to also have enrononline to include data on Colombia in the enrononline informational site .  She says that it is very easy to include this information  and that in principle she doesn't  think there is a problem in linking enrononline to ISA if it is going to be only for the informational site. She referred me to Rahil Jafry (content) to discuss the process to make the Colombia information to be included in the site. I talked to him and we scheduled a meeting for Friday at 8:30AM. Please confirm ASAP if you will be available for this meeting Thanks, Maria Elena 
Thanks for forwarding on the MSJ opinion.  Any objection to my sending it on to our US counsel (Sullivan & Cromwell) who are coordinating many of these 
In US financial trading (derivatives) we send the attachment each time, but it should only be 4 or 5 pages long.  This may be different in the physical trading world - I'll check into it. Louise Kitchen 01/21/2000 02:48 PM 
Thoughts? 
Thank you  Louise, Just one remark which came back to me already a couple of time. When we close a transaction with our normal counterparties, why do we need to send the GTC each time since when we close OTC witrh these same counterparties, this is not necessary ? They are finding that our confirmations are 13 pages long for a single swap. Do you think we could avoid sending the GTC for some of our most active counterparties ? Regards Raphael 
Congrats Justin!  Good job! Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Jan - can you please take care of scheduling this. 
Mark, Paul will be in Houston and was wondering if we could schedule an hour meeting sometime during  Wednesday 20th and Thursday 21st January. Look forward to hearing from you. Regards Sharon ++ 171 970 7003 (Direct) Credit Risk Management - London 
We need to act on this today - what is your advice on how we proceed based on the fact that they clearly appear to be in breach. Gene Diers@ENRON 01/24/2000 12:34 PM 
Louise, the contract is clear on this.  Here is what is states in ATTACHMENT A - AMENDMENTS TO AGREEMENT a.  Publicity ""Contractor shall never reference Company in any advertising or publicity without its written consent.  Specifically, no reference must be made to Company or any of its affiliates in any form of communication, wither verbal or written or through any other media, including but not limited to printed advertising or marketing materials, oral or print presentations, digital or online media, or any other reference whatsoever to Company without the express prior written consent of Company."". Let me know if you need anything additional gene Louise Kitchen@ECT 01/23/2000 11:45 AM 
Could you both please verify that the following use of our name is a breach of contract on Agency's side.  They also want to do a press release which we have not agreed to and I will be saying no to this on Monday.  I would like to follow this with some legal reponse to this breach in contract immediately - ie tomorrow. Let me know what you think. Louise

It never ends. 
Bob: This communication is to keep everyone informed of the back office issues related to EOL trades with Aquilia The Aquilia office (Aquilia Energy) in Omaha contacted our Settlements team regarding the EOL day deals(invoices) stating that they were not Aquilia Energy or Aquilia Risk Deals but rather Aquilia Southwest deals.  Aquilia Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.  To ensure timely payment, Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk will be made by Aquilia Southwest.  Aquilia wanted us to change the counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed. Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues. Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the effort to getting the invoices to the correct office. I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.  I would like clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for Physical deals. Thanks, KC 
Glad you liked them.  Yes, cats do seem to like to explore all sorts of spaces - grocery bags are always a good bet.  I remember Dusty, the cat we had in Bethesda, used to like to sleep at the foot of my bed - under the covers.  Go figure.  I'd be happy to send you acopy of the photo of me. And yes again, the online platform mentioned in the analyst's report is the system I've spent so much time on over the last nine months or so.  It's kind of exciting to see a project in print like that but now it means we have to really make it work! I received the package from MetLife on the Long-Term Care insurance.  I had a couple of questions which I called the company about (premiums, pre-tax vs. after tax, etc.) and would be happy to go over it with you.  Do you want me to send the stuff to you or should we just chart about it frst? 
I found this picture of my boat on the internet!

II have tried to approve this through the Data Manager - not sure if it worked. I know we must have been through this any number of times before but each time I read one of these I wonder how we are supposed to figure out the Notional Quantity.  It says ""calculated from the volume submitted by Counterparty on the website"" but how do we know how to calculate it?  Where does it say whether that number is a daily or monthly number?  Gallons or Barrels?  I remain confused. Dale Neuner on 01/25/2000 09:21:44 AM 
Thanks, Bjorn, Please go into the DataManager and indicate your approval. Kevin and Jeff; please review and make the same indication. To all: we are working on getting the e-mail notification repaired. Dale 
Looks fine to me! It seems consistant with all the other things we trade in the OTC postion of our book. Regards Bjorn H. Dale Neuner on 01/24/2000 04:59:42 PM 
Mark and Bjorn- I've created a new Product Type - Jet Kero Financial Swap. The automatic e-mail notification isn't working so I won't know if you go in and approve the product. Please review the attached, as well as the below Long Description, and offer you approval/comments. (You will find it in the Partially Approved section - as credit has offered their sign-off). As you could imagine trading is eager to get this out on the web. Mark - Once the Product Type is approved we will build the complete product and I'll send that to you for review. ""A US Jet Kerosene financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. under which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in respect of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period. The Notional Quantity per Determination Period shall be calculated from the volume submitted by Counterparty on the website. Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Payment Date(s) will be 5 business days after the Floating Price is determinable.  The Floating Price shall be the Index for

Trading wants to conduct Basis Swaps of Last Day NYMEX vs the Gas Daily Average of ANR Louisiana. I've created the below language accordingly and would like for you to review. The words in BOLD were added to make this 'work'. Index:  NYMEX HH L1/GD ANR LA Abbreviation: GD ANR-LA Sort Code: 1210 Description: The Fixed Price shall be the settlement price for the last scheduled Trading Day of the NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract, modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the website, for the applicable Determination Period. [Is this for the contract for delivery during the Determination Period - in which case maybe we should say ""for delivery during the applicable Determination Period""?] The Floating Price for the applicable Determination Period shall be the average of the Daily Midpoint prices published on each calendar day during such Determination Period under the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" in the Louisiana - Onshore South, ANR section of Gas Daily, or if Gas Daily is not published on a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on in the next suceeding issue of Gas DailyBusiness Day. [Do we have a problem if the next price published is int he following calendar month?] Dale 
Thank you very much - can I get a copy of the Risk article? The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy derivatives markets that would be helpful. Judith Schlesinger 01/25/2000 09:42 AM 
Mark, I found an article in Risk, April 1999 titled ""Banking on energy derivatives: Brokers are acting more and more like investment banks, designing structured trades and bundled risk management solutions.  Nowhere is the trend more clear than in the energy markets.""   Also,  the attached reports describe the OTC market.  Please let me know where to go from here. Judy 3-9584 
Hey Amanda! Yao just gave me your e-mail address.  He had told me you were at UVA a couple of months ago.  How do you like law school so far?  I have to admit I pretty much hated every minute of it.  Now that I think about it, I can't say that being a lawyer had been all that much fun either.  Oh well, the pay is pretty good. I found this picture of my boat on the internet site of the charter company that rents it out for me when I'm not sailing (which is most of the time). When are we going sailing again?  Got any good vacation weeks coming up?  The Caribbean sure sounds good right about now...... 
Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination. Let me know what you think. 
Just a couple of comments and questions: Is it appropriate to refer to these as ""US"" transactions since the prices are clearly from outside the US?  I recognize that ENA is the counterparty but I think this may be confusing to our customers. The term Business Day should be capitalized (it's defined in the GTC) [but it's defined with reference to NY & Houston banks being open - does that work for pulp transactions?]. I'm not thrilled with the language for the last ten days of the contract period on the Pulpex description - is that what we use for current confirmations? 
Mark We have created two new Pulp Products, on based on the PIX, one the Pulpex. PLease review and offer comments/approval. 
I glanced at the power product description (what I could see of it) - Is it definately a physical transaction?  where does the power get delivered?  If it really is physical, I'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to look it over. Dale Neuner on 01/25/2000 02:30:10 PM 
Two new Product Types have been created and require approval. In the DataManager you will find: US Jet Kero Fin Swap - which you will find in Partialy Approved and US West Power Phy Spd - which you will find in Awaiting Approval. The automated e-mail function associated with the notification of parties when a Product Type is created or approved is not functioning, and we are working to have the problem fixed. In the interim, please approve the Product Types and send me an e-mail when you are done. As you would expect the respective commercial areas are eager to have these Product Types availabble for trading. Dale 3-9746

I have enlisted the assistance of Carol St. Clair to handle the ETA comments and negotiations.  I will be meeting with her this afternoon to go over the details of what we have been doing so far.  It would make sense for you to meet her at some point in the near future.  She is not a junior lawyer by any stretch and should be able to handle most issues that come up with minimal assistance.  In fact, as she becomes more familiar with EOL and its structure/issues generally, she will make a great back-up for me for all EOL issues. Louise Kitchen 01/25/2000 11:21 AM 
We are experiencing an high level of cusotmers wishing to speak to a lawyer on the EnronOnline agreements and bearing in mind you have other jobs we need to have someone permanently manning the phone for all the industrials.  Could you get another Edmund type working for you who mans the phones permanently so we can get people on the system immediately. Thanks Louise 
There are about 15 - 20 pages you would probably want to see.  If that's not too many for you to receive I don't mind faxing it.  You can always call me from the office with the fax number when you're ready - I can even leave it with my assistant when I'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of me. It's finally winter here, too.  Of course that's nothing compared to you guys - it might get down into the 30's at night and 40's in the daytime.  It's only really bad when it's that cold and it rains.  Brrrr.  It was probably pretty smart of Delta to send those planes to Cincinnati since as a hub they could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else (of course a lot were probably headed to NYC and the flights there the next day must have been packed!). Aside from a quick one-day trip to New York I haven't had to do any traveling lately - I'll probably be going to Portland in early March and Amsterdam mid-March.  I may try and get to South America sometime in February but nothing is scheduled yet. 
You know, I must have received your message on Tuesday because I remember reading it - but I can't find it in my computer.  Can you resend so I'll have the dates?  My guess is you shouldn't arrange space for me.  If I can get there for part of the time and there is a spare couch then fine & if not I'm sure I'll find a room somewhere close by. 
I found this picture of my boat on the internet! 
Sorry for the delay - our general policy is (and the first response to this type of question should be) that , due to system requirements, it is not possible to provide for different online contracts for different counterparties.  Having said that, in the few cases where a counterparty has raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns, we have agreed to a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms of the ETA.  So if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens to not use the system for legal reasons, you should refer them to the legal department.  They can contact either Carol St. Clair (x33989) or me (x37459). Cecil John@ENRON 01/27/2000 11:00 AM 
Hello Mark, I am trying to follow up on Remedy Tk ( 54001 ). I opened this Tk for this customer having questions about the ETA. Please let me know, how you would like to respond to customer's inquiry about modifications to the ETA.. Thanks. Cecil John EnronOnline 713-853-6259 
Hello Mark, Please advise me on this matter and let me know if you want me to follow up with the customer or if you contact customer.  EOL customer is inquiring about if their Lawyers can modify or  make comments to the ETA. Thanks. Cecil John EnronOnline 713-853-6259 
My manager had a question concerning the ETA's and if they can be modified if our Lawyers have comments or changes that they would like to make. Thanks 
Any concerns? 
The EOL help desk received a call from Isabelle Ealet at J Aron in London (0171 774 2103).  She was asking them why she could not trade with her id and password that she had been given. I called her and explained that she could not use a Guest Id to trade and told her that she needed to send in a UK PA (explained to her the location of the form on the web site).  She said she would send one to us. Then she told me that it was not a problem anyway because she called her New York office and asked them to give her and id - they set her up as a sub user.  She then told me that she transacted a deal in London for EN590.  I told her that her PA would not cover this and I am not sure she understood this ? Therefore she will have transacted in London under a US PA - correct ? Please advise as to how we are to deal with this. Thanks 
Yes, thanks - I think Tana is going to call to get some help interpreting the numbers. Rudi Zipter 01/27/2000 07:42 AM 
Mark, Was the market data on gas and power volumes useful to your project? Rudi 
Christian has not yet gotten back to me but I have asked him to check on the dates we discussed for early/mid March. 
I am not sure if Christian got back with you on the possible timing for our legal seminar in Portland but Tim Belden is out until Friday and Christian is out until Monday.  Christian indicated to me that he was going to call you on Monday with a definitive date. The web site is now available outside the firewall.  The location is http://www.enronwest.com    Be aware that this is currently only a template site. Let me know if you need any additional information. Regards, Mike 503-464-3836 
Do we know where J Aron wants us to settle the trade done from London?  If it is still settled by payment to New York, this one trade probably does not cause too much heartburn. (See the note from Steve Douglas in Tax next following.) 
Yes.  Our tax compliance system is premised upon the trading ""pattern"" (type of trader, location, etc.) represented to us in the materials pursuant to which we establish a counterparty.  In this case, J Aron is transacting via either a different legal entity in London or a branch of the entity that was initially approved that is located in London with a password acquired on the basis that they would be trading from New York (presumably from a U.S. corporation).  In either event, while there may not be an issue as to this particular transaction, because we do not know the type of counterparty with whom we are transacting, we could potentially have a U.S. tax withholding issue when settlement payments are made (this, of course, assuming that we settle with the London branch/entity trading with the U.S. approved password).  Consequently, we would prefer to more tightly contain the trading patterns of counterparties and not permit this type of trading (doesn't this violate reps made in the GTC?).  Alternatively, if all that is occurring is that a U.S. approved counterparty is using a password to transact from a different physical location, this presents an issue for the counterparty (namely, creation of a taxable presence in London or such other location) but, so long as we only settle with the approved counterparty under the terms pursuant to which their account was set up (i.e., in the U.S. in the case of this transaction), this should not present an issue for EOL.  Give me a call should you want to follow up.  Steve.

We're looking forward to stopping by but it may be a little later - not sure about the exact schedule for the eve.  Mind if we bring a friend or two?

We have asked the EnronOnline team to send the Master User ID and Password to the person who signed the PA.  Our theory was that the signer presumably has the authority to bind the counterparty and understands that any holder of the password can also bind the counterparty.  If they want to give it to someone else, so be it.  But we should not be taking it upon ourselves to send the password to someone else unless we have conducted the same level of due diligence on that name as we have on the PA signer.  I was told we were not looking into the authority of the ""nominated"" Master Users inn any way but that we were taking some steps to verify the authority of the PA signers.  It 
The package you sent arrived today.  I'll open it when I get home.

Jeff: Sorry for the delay - I'm still trying to track this down.  Obviously I don't know the answer right off and no one I've asked so far knows for sure (although those who know a little something about the area don't think it looks good).  I hope to have a final answer for you early next week. Mark

Dear Schuyler: It seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the Euromoney people on swap documentation.  We used to send our new lawyers and more experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more experienced lawyers to the advanced course.  It appears that Euromoney is no longer putting this on.  Are you doing something similar through another provider? 
The system is certainly not set up to accommodate that now but we could probably draft around it on a case by case basis.  It strikes me that while we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this, the credit considerations are more problematic.  I would guess that the back office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the trades.  This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some respects.  When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the appropriate headroom.  I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would  that be acceptable to everyone?  Another possibility is for the fund to set up a master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to back deals with whichever entities need the allocations.  That would let them do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other entities.  Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for credit on its own somehow.  Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would be difficult (upstream guarantee problems). 
We met with the commercial team this afternoon and I was able to piece together the following: Access to the auction site will be by clicking on a button on the EnronOnline (note spelling) trading page. Most users of the site will already be signed up for EnronOnline - both a PA and ETA executed.

I thought your Mom might like the first three. 
If you didn't believe us before, I'm sure it is by now painfully clear that negotiating master swap agreements is a very lengthy process.  My impression is that the commercial team in Portland is anxious to begin trading financially.  If this is correct, it would be possible, at least from a legal point of view, to begin trading now under the existing documents.  In each case where a master agreement is already in place, trades entered into before the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties.  Our only issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage.  As to the credit issue, only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading under the existing terms.  As for the negotiating leverage, if the commercial people want to resume trading immediately, my suggestion would be to let them go ahead.  If it turns out that additional leverage is needed, we can always stop trading. Where no master swap agreement exists, we have documentation available to enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed.  The so-called ""omnibus"" confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions - even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty. Tana has unsuccessfully tried to get you access to our Lotus Notes database so you could determine the status of any negotiation on an up-to-the-minute basis.  She will be sending a monthly report of our progress until you get the necessary software to access the database.  Of course, if any issues come

The Option Investor Newsletter          1-17-98 Sunday             Part 3 of 7 ****************************************** TLAB - Tellabs $85.94 (+11.63)(P3W $10.18) Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems, and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from customers among the telephone companies, cable operators, and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major player. Wow!  What a play.  TLAB gave up only $0.44 in Thursday's turmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at $85.94.  Technicals look outstanding with a small consolidation already taken place; all indicators in positive territory.  We introduced the play Thursday under the following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78 on 11 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously set at $70.  TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to $79, on average volume of 3.5 million.  Over the previous 3 trading days, it gained in market weakness while giving back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright bearish market - a terrific sign of strength.  3.5 million shares traded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share in cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.  We expect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks. Recent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a good story.  We could find no news on Friday driving the price; just market recovery and stock momentum. Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a ""buy"" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35 and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000, respectively.  They further state, ""fundamentals for the telecom equipment group has improved over the past few months which improves visibility for Tellabs"" and ""Our checks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 1998 results slightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate, as well as having a positive outlook for 1999"" (Reuters). Also, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted buyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.  Not soon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the price move.

The Company's primary product areas are the OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based, mobile communications system providing two-way data and position reporting services), CDMA wireless communications systems and products and, in conjunction with others, the development of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communications system.  The company's CDMA technology has become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the US and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other countries.  Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US wireless industry is migrating from analog to digital. In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other companies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line telephone service in Brazil.  QCOM has indicated, in the past, that it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.  Since 1990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in China has been about 160%, according to government figures. QCOM is building a global presence.  It was also reported on CNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a takeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the LU/ASND merger.  If fact, the entire sector is expecting another round of takeovers given the competitive landscape. QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.  It actually fell below its 200 day moving average in December, and then started its current run around the beginning of the year. QCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.  As you know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but QCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the earnings release.  Depending on the earnings release on Tuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given the merger activity in the sector.  After the earnings release, wait for a direction before initiating a play.

It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well. Nokia is increasing plant capacity to keep up with demand. We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a split candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily for us into the first week of January, when the stock got ahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to enthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI bids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on Jan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to recommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's $6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the stock remains well above its moving averages, so we are adding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA announced a split in Feb. 1998, a long and steep split run followed. We have been unable to confirm the expected earnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we will keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new split announcement. Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile phone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of Miami. Other recent news on this stock can still be found in previous newsletters posted on the O.I. website. When researching NOK.A, be aware that some sites require the dot and some won't allow it.

Although it's current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M- pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do. They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC landscape. Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous week.  Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above average volume for 4 of 5 trading days.  Friday gave us an $8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.  CS First Boston said Microsoft ""appears on track"" to meet or beat estimate of 60 cents per share - an increase of 46 percent from the 42 cents in the same quarter last year.  Sales are expected to increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.  With conviction, we still predict a stock split with the earnings announcement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed this date); only 1 trading day away.  Historically, MSFT has split like clockwork at $140.  MSFT has expressed optimism about their future and has every reason to split the stock.  MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high of $152.50, set the previous week.  Prudential last week set a price target of $175.  We think their relative price compared to the market reflects strong investor confidence. A great play in the making. Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge scolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language requiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a pending lawsuit over the software giant's employment practices (Reuters).  It had no affect on the stock, but raised eyebrows in the PR department.  Conversely, a new Microsoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers believe that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers and the computer software industry (Reuters).  The real surprise was another press release stating Robert Bork believes Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an unusual comment from a free market champion, until you realize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the Justice Departments case.  Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun- Java infringement injunction citing that it believes the court mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun as a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.  We reiterate, ""no material effect on earnings"".

CHKPF has an incredible record of earning surprises.  Next earnings are scheduled for January 21st.  Holding over earnings is a risky proposition, but for those risk takers out there, it might pay off.  There is a possibility that CHKPF might announce a stock split.  They have plenty of shares, but have never announced a split in the past. MACD is positive and CHKPF price is above all moving averages. Between Tuesday and earnings after the close on Thursday, CHKPF could have a nice run. CHKPF, along with other networking security companies, will be holding a seminar in February. This seminar will outline the future of the business and the strategies these companies use and how they can help other companies with their information security.

Last year's $178.2 million in revenues reflect the big downturn in the semi-conductor industry, but that is changing. The 1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and demand is strong again for these products. After hitting a high of $37.50 in Feb. 1998, PRIA stock had lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company such as PRIA will benefit. On January 12th, CIBC Oppenheimer upgraded PRIA to strong buy from buy. This as a momentum play in an improving industry.  Earnings due out Jan. 28th.

Revenues for MU=20 declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs and semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much product industry wide and too little demand, but the company is recovering now, as demand increases. With the industry gaining steam, market expectations for Micron's earnings were high in December, and the stock pulled back when MU did not beat analysts' earnings by a wide enough margin. However, MU has lately begun climbing again and gathering momentum. Even in this past week's down market, the stock looked fairly strong. Chip prices climbed 6% last week as Koreans permanently slashed production and may actually swing the market from an overproduction last year to a scarcity in the coming year. The wild card in the future supply is Taiwan. Already, though, chip prices, which were $200 a year ago, and fell below $60 in May, have climbed to near $90. At the same time, sales for PCs and the chips that go in them are showing strong increases, and that will eventually show up in MU's bottom line. This is a momentum play. CBS Marketwatch screened stocks for 20 different characteristics and MU turned out in the top group. The five best characteristics: 1)Strong recent earnings/revenue growth, 2)Selling at a discount to its growth, 3)Consistently beats analysts expectations, 4)Earnings estimates continually revised upwards, 5)Short- and long- term relative strength.

The company's products are used in PCs, printers, network hardware, cellular phones, and cars. JBL's major customers include Hewlett Packard, 3Com, and Cisco Systems with more than half of its revenues coming from telecommunications companies.  JBL's customers use contract manufacturers, like JBL, to save money and improve production times.  JBL has manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, Mexico, the UK, and the US.  Insiders own approximately 41% of the company. In the news last week, Everen Securities initiated coverage on JBL with an intermediate term market perform and a long term outperform.  The press release did note, that in the near-term they believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long term it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this industry tends to move together. Last week, JBL bounced off of its 21 day moving average and closed right at its 10 day moving average on Friday.  There also appears to be some support for JBL around $71.  JBL has been on extended run since last September, and given the way the sector goes in and out of favor with the Street, you should keep a close eye on JBL if you are playing it.  If JBL were to break below $71, in a significant way, we would be very cautious of the stock.  Also, as with any sector, but more so with this one, you have to keep an eye on the sector when playing JBL.

Its printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers (for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors, Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters. Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets in more than 150 countries. LXK consolidated this last week and is sitting right on its 20-dma. We still like LXK with earnings on the 26th of January. Remember, holding over earnings is risky. In the case of LXK, the risk might be justified if they announce a stock split. Each individual has to weigh out the risk themselves. LXK hasn't had any news the last few days. These last few weeks have seen LXK get recommended by many different professionals as a great stock to own for 1999. Remember, LXK has had an average earnings surprise of 11.75% over the last four quarters. This could help propel LXK higher before earnings on the expectation. There are different earnings dates listed on the web, but First Call does list the 26th of January. We will continue to try to get a fixed date from investor relations.

The company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share information from all major computing environments, including UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut technological edge over its competition.  The company has been able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open systems market. There really wasn't any news last week on EMC.  We think the real story happened on Thursday, when the NASDAQ was down and EMC went up.  This suggests that there are still a lot of buyers who want EMC stock.  This was confirmed by the move EMC made on Friday.  We continue to read  articles that discuss EMC being in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.  There was an article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top 30 growth stocks.  EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a great momentum stock. EMC took off again on Friday.  It set a new 52 week high on Friday, and closed near the high.  As we discussed above, EMC is one of those stocks that people keep buying.  As long as there are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with it's momentum.  EMC is also a split candidate.  We know we keep saying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases the probability of a split.  A year ago this last November EMC split at around $63 after a strong move.  FYI - EMC reports earnings before the open on 1/26.

The Option Investor Newsletter          1-17-98 Sunday             Part 3 of 7 ****************************************** TLAB - Tellabs $85.94 (+11.63)(P3W $10.18) Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems, and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from customers among the telephone companies, cable operators, and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major player. Wow!  What a play.  TLAB gave up only $0.44 in Thursday's turmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at $85.94.  Technicals look outstanding with a small consolidation already taken place; all indicators in positive territory.  We introduced the play Thursday under the following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78 on 11 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously set at $70.  TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to $79, on average volume of 3.5 million.  Over the previous 3 trading days, it gained in market weakness while giving back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright bearish market - a terrific sign of strength.  3.5 million shares traded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share in cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.  We expect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks. Recent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a good story.  We could find no news on Friday driving the price; just market recovery and stock momentum. Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a ""buy"" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35 and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000, respectively.  They further state, ""fundamentals for the telecom equipment group has improved over the past few months which improves visibility for Tellabs"" and ""Our checks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 1998 results slightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate, as well as having a positive outlook for 1999"" (Reuters). Also, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted buyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.  Not soon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the price move.

The Company's primary product areas are the OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based, mobile communications system providing two-way data and position reporting services), CDMA wireless communications systems and products and, in conjunction with others, the development of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communications system.  The company's CDMA technology has become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the US and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other countries.  Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US wireless industry is migrating from analog to digital. In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other companies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line telephone service in Brazil.  QCOM has indicated, in the past, that it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.  Since 1990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in China has been about 160%, according to government figures. QCOM is building a global presence.  It was also reported on CNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a takeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the LU/ASND merger.  If fact, the entire sector is expecting another round of takeovers given the competitive landscape. QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.  It actually fell below its 200 day moving average in December, and then started its current run around the beginning of the year. QCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.  As you know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but QCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the earnings release.  Depending on the earnings release on Tuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given the merger activity in the sector.  After the earnings release, wait for a direction before initiating a play.

It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well. Nokia is increasing plant capacity to keep up with demand. We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a split candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily for us into the first week of January, when the stock got ahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to enthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI bids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on Jan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to recommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's $6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the stock remains well above its moving averages, so we are adding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA announced a split in Feb. 1998, a long and steep split run followed. We have been unable to confirm the expected earnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we will keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new split announcement. Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile phone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of Miami. Other recent news on this stock can still be found in previous newsletters posted on the O.I. website. When researching NOK.A, be aware that some sites require the dot and some won't allow it.

Although it's current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M- pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do. They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC landscape. Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous week.  Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above average volume for 4 of 5 trading days.  Friday gave us an $8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.  CS First Boston said Microsoft ""appears on track"" to meet or beat estimate of 60 cents per share - an increase of 46 percent from the 42 cents in the same quarter last year.  Sales are expected to increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.  With conviction, we still predict a stock split with the earnings announcement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed this date); only 1 trading day away.  Historically, MSFT has split like clockwork at $140.  MSFT has expressed optimism about their future and has every reason to split the stock.  MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high of $152.50, set the previous week.  Prudential last week set a price target of $175.  We think their relative price compared to the market reflects strong investor confidence. A great play in the making. Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge scolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language requiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a pending lawsuit over the software giant's employment practices (Reuters).  It had no affect on the stock, but raised eyebrows in the PR department.  Conversely, a new Microsoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers believe that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers and the computer software industry (Reuters).  The real surprise was another press release stating Robert Bork believes Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an unusual comment from a free market champion, until you realize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the Justice Departments case.  Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun- Java infringement injunction citing that it believes the court mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun as a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.  We reiterate, ""no material effect on earnings"".

FireWall-1 authenticates remote users, controls access, and blocks viruses and other undesirable Web content. Its FloodGate-1 clears up traffic congestion on crowded Internet and intranet links by allocating available space to company-defined uses. Check Point's largest customer is Sun Microsystems' SunSoft, which accounts for about 20% of sales. Check Point operates subsidiaries in Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim. CHKPF is a company that benefits from the explosion in the Internet.  As companies increase their use of the web, CHKPF's services will be needed more and more.  CHKPF has an incredible record of earning surprises.  Next earnings are scheduled for January 21st.  Holding over earnings is a risky proposition, but for those risk takers out there, it might pay off.  There is a possibility that CHKPF might announce a stock split.  They have plenty of shares, but have never announced a split in the past. MACD is positive and CHKPF price is above all moving averages. Between Tuesday and earnings after the close on Thursday, CHKPF could have a nice run. CHKPF, along with other networking security companies, will be holding a seminar in February. This seminar will outline the future of the business and the strategies these companies use and how they can help other companies with their information security.

Last year's $178.2 million in revenues reflect the big downturn in the semi-conductor industry, but that is changing. The 1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and demand is strong again for these products. After hitting a high of $37.50 in Feb. 1998, PRIA stock had lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company such as PRIA will benefit. On January 12th, CIBC Oppenheimer upgraded PRIA to strong buy from buy. This as a momentum play in an improving industry.  Earnings due out Jan. 28th.

Revenues for MU=20 declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs and semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much product industry wide and too little demand, but the company is recovering now, as demand increases. With the industry gaining steam, market expectations for Micron's earnings were high in December, and the stock pulled back when MU did not beat analysts' earnings by a wide enough margin. However, MU has lately begun climbing again and gathering momentum. Even in this past week's down market, the stock looked fairly strong. Chip prices climbed 6% last week as Koreans permanently slashed production and may actually swing the market from an overproduction last year to a scarcity in the coming year. The wild card in the future supply is Taiwan. Already, though, chip prices, which were $200 a year ago, and fell below $60 in May, have climbed to near $90. At the same time, sales for PCs and the chips that go in them are showing strong increases, and that will eventually show up in MU's bottom line. This is a momentum play. CBS Marketwatch screened stocks for 20 different characteristics and MU turned out in the top group. The five best characteristics: 1)Strong recent earnings/revenue growth, 2)Selling at a discount to its growth, 3)Consistently beats analysts expectations, 4)Earnings estimates continually revised upwards, 5)Short- and long- term relative strength.

The company's products are used in PCs, printers, network hardware, cellular phones, and cars. JBL's major customers include Hewlett Packard, 3Com, and Cisco Systems with more than half of its revenues coming from telecommunications companies.  JBL's customers use contract manufacturers, like JBL, to save money and improve production times.  JBL has manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, Mexico, the UK, and the US.  Insiders own approximately 41% of the company. In the news last week, Everen Securities initiated coverage on JBL with an intermediate term market perform and a long term outperform.  The press release did note, that in the near-term they believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long term it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this industry tends to move together. Last week, JBL bounced off of its 21 day moving average and closed right at its 10 day moving average on Friday.  There also appears to be some support for JBL around $71.  JBL has been on extended run since last September, and given the way the sector goes in and out of favor with the Street, you should keep a close eye on JBL if you are playing it.  If JBL were to break below $71, in a significant way, we would be very cautious of the stock.  Also, as with any sector, but more so with this one, you have to keep an eye on the sector when playing JBL.

Lexmark International Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers (for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors, Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters. Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets in more than 150 countries. LXK consolidated this last week and is sitting right on its 20-dma. We still like LXK with earnings on the 26th of January. Remember, holding over earnings is risky. In the case of LXK, the risk might be justified if they announce a stock split. Each individual has to weigh out the risk themselves. LXK hasn't had any news the last few days. These last few weeks have seen LXK get recommended by many different professionals as a great stock to own for 1999. Remember, LXK has had an average earnings surprise of 11.75% over the last four quarters. This could help propel LXK higher before earnings on the expectation. There are different earnings dates listed on the web, but First Call does list the 26th of January. We will continue to try to get a fixed date from investor relations.

The company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share information from all major computing environments, including UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut technological edge over its competition.  The company has been able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open systems market. There really wasn't any news last week on EMC.  We think the real story happened on Thursday, when the NASDAQ was down and EMC went up.  This suggests that there are still a lot of buyers who want EMC stock.  This was confirmed by the move EMC made on Friday.  We continue to read  articles that discuss EMC being in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.  There was an article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top 30 growth stocks.  EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a great momentum stock. EMC took off again on Friday.  It set a new 52 week high on Friday, and closed near the high.  As we discussed above, EMC is one of those stocks that people keep buying.  As long as there are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with it's momentum.  EMC is also a split candidate.  We know we keep saying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases the probability of a split.  A year ago this last November EMC split at around $63 after a strong move.  FYI - EMC reports earnings before the open on 1/26.

XIRC is expecting to announce earnings that are 300% higher than the same quarter last year.  With the large earning surprises XIRC has had the last four quarter, a nice run could develop into earnings. Though a split isn't likely, the company has enough shares to announced one. There is no split history for XIRC.  XIRC reached a new 52-week high on Friday when it hit $40.50. XIRC was recently selected as one of the best mobile PC cards.

This week we are going discuss one of the many pitfalls that you will eventually encounter as a trader; Incorrect Information... Occasionally, we will discover an error in a stock or option quote and usually it comes to us ""the hard way"". Last week, we offered a position on Reliance Bancorp (RELY) and it turns out that the option quoted was for another stock. It was not a research error or miss-type, just erroneous quote information provided to the trading public. One of our faithful readers had the unfortunate experience of buying into this play on the assumption that the option existed. We received permission to reprint portions of his remarks to educate our readers. Here is the general narrative; ""I did my 'due diligence' on the options play with Reliance Bancorp but like a growing number of people this was all handled on-line with me as the only human in the food chain willing to take any chances. Oddly though, I did speak to two other people in this and got an interesting mix of answers. I used (two common brokerages; names deleted) for my information, perhaps using two separate entities was my downfall here. One stated just as you did that there was a Reliance, FEB25-Call at the same bid as you published. If fact, it showed an array of options for Reliance. However, come to find out they were Verio. I then bought shares of Reliance on-line through another broker in my IRA with the intention of selling calls against them the next day. When I entered the ticker symbol to 'sell calls to open', I was greeted by a statement about Verio. Calling the broker, I was told that the ticker symbol was in fact for Verio but only the Feb. call. I then contacted the option trading desk and found that the ticker symbol belonged to Verio and there were no options on RELY at all. I was fooled by the apparent presence of options at one brokerage, which tells me that I need to do all my research

The Option Investor Newsletter            1-17-98 Sunday                6  of  7 ****************************************************************** COMBINATION PLAYS - MARKET RECAP -Boom or Bust? ****************************************************************** U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, snapping back from the problem of Brazilian currency devaluation as investors showed new confidence in the market. The Dow closed up 220 points at 9340.55 and the Nasdaq was up 71 points at 2348.21. Internet traders were focused on Marketwatch.com as shares surged 473% and markets around the world benefited from Brazil's move to let the inflation-busting real float. The question is: Will the enthusiasm fade next week? Our new spread plays were all available at favorable prices. The first candidate was CIEN and a debit price of $3.50 (FEB12C/17C) was easily attained in the morning trading. SDTI and SRCM went in different directions but both were still playable. The credit for the SDTI spread (FEB17P/20P) was slightly less than expected at $0.50 and SRCM (FEB15P/17P) was right in line at $0.75. SRCM is primarily a merger-speculation play and without news or continued rumors, the stock price will drop. Watch it closely! AAPL was our leg-in play and as recommended, we started with a long position (FEB35P) at $1.12 and used the afternoon's downward momentum to increase the price of the short option (FEB37P) to $2.00 for a credit of $0.87. SUNW was up at the open but favorable positions were still available at 10:00 AM as the stock price took a quick breather. The (LJAN100C/FEB100C) calendar spread traded at $14.00. Friday was expiration day for many of our plays and one of them was a heart-stopper! Our credit spread on MCHP suffered cardiac arrest after the company (on Thursday night) reported earnings that were up from the previous year, but below Street estimates. Shares fell over $5 in morning trading and although it eventually went the distance (finishing at $35.12), the prudent exit was at mid-day for a closing debit of $0.50, to break-even. The rest of the credit spreads expired safely OTM. Even those that held AAPL and BMCS to the close were successful. We are starting to see more progress in the calendar spreads as some of the positions are ""paid for"" and many have been moved to the next higher strike. Our biggest dilemma is the ATI LEAP play as the company said it agreed to merge with Britain's Vodafone Group in a stock deal valued at about $56 billion. The merger is considered valued at $97 per AirTouch common share and we are curious to see the opening prices on our current positions next week. Other short positions that were closed include CPQ, NOVL and WCOM. New options need to be sold on OXHP and WCOM. BGP was our only dismal failure and there may be some recovery next week. The debit spreads did better this month, primarily because the market was so bullish. Our main focus next week is the LU play. We already have a profit and will plan to exit early on any bump before the earnings. We are also watching FTL for any further downward movement and hopefully some new take-over rumors will surface. Good Luck! ****************************************************************** - CREDIT SPREAD SUMMARY - ****************************************************************** Stock   Pick     Last      Position   Credit  Cost    G/L   Status AAS     $59.53    $79.50  JAN70C/65C  $0.68  $0.62   $0.06  Closed AAPL    $38.00    $41.31  JAN47C/45C  $0.50  $0.25   $0.25  Closed AAPL    $41.38    $41.31  FEB35P/37P  $0.87  $1.00  ($0.12)  Open AGPH    $48.93    $58.00  JAN40P/35P  $0.43  $0.00   $0.43  Closed ALA     $23.19    $24.56  JAN15P/17P  $0.31  $0.00   $0.32  Closed AOL    $154.62   $146.50 JAN120P/125P $1.25  $0.00   $1.25  Closed ATHM    $80.25   $102.00  JAN65P/70P  $0.38  $0.00   $0.38  Closed BMCS    $44.56    $40.06  JAN35P/40P  $0.87  $1.12  ($0.25) Closed CMGI   $119.87    $96.38  JAN80P/85P  $0.62  $0.00   $0.62  Closed GT      $52.12    $50.00  JAN65C/60C  $0.43  $0.00   $0.43  Closed IGEN    $30.62    $34.25  JAN22P/25P  $0.38  $0.00   $0.38  Closed MCHP    $39.25    $35.13  JAN30P/35P  $0.50  $0.50   $0.00  Closed SDTI    $25.50    $27.50  FEB17P/20P  $0.50  $0.62  ($0.12)  Open SRCM    $20.87    $19.75  FEB15P/17P  $0.75  $0.75   $0.00   Open VNWK    $35.25    $43.50  JAN25P/30P  $0.50  $0.00   $0.50  Closed Credit spreads are profitable if both positions remain OTM until expiration.

Financial institutions, retailers, automobile and manufactured-housing dealers, and representatives then retail these policies to consumers. Products include property insurance (on items ranging from mobile homes to appliances), as well as life, unemployment, and disability insurance. Trading in American Bankers Insurance Group options has been brisk lately following weeks of inactivity as bid speculation reemerges. Traders cited talk that American International Group, which had attempted to buy American Bankers last year, (before Cendant Corp outbid AIG and then pulled out of the deal because of accounting problems) would return with another offer. Things are heating up as ING Baring Furman Selz said it resumed coverage of ABI with a ""strong buy"" rating. The report says American Bankers is one of its favorite companies among specialty insurers and states the company is likely to resume double digit revenue and earnings growth in the second half of 1999 while earning 15% to 20% on its equity. The 1999 share price target is $58 and the technical outlook is favorable.

They have about 6 million members and Humana tries to cut costs by offering physicians incentives and requiring pre-authorization for hospital inpatient services and outpatient surgery. Medicare accounts for almost one-third of sales, but Humana is cutting back its Medicare HMO business. The company markets its products to employers and other groups, as well as to certain Medicare-eligible individuals. In the past year, Humana has been the sector's most active merger, acquisition and divestiture participant as the company moved to purchase health plans in its largest markets while divesting non- strategic assets to focus on profitable core businesses. A Florida appellate court recently ruled that a lawsuit against Humana could not proceed as a class action and that it should be dissolved. The opinion strongly supports HUM's contention that the class action had no merit. This may help investors regain favor with the company as its likely their business practices have always been both ethical and legal. The chart reflects a new range of trading developing near $20 and that makes it perfect for a calendar spread.

If the near-term call expires worthless, we will sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In that case, your long option is going up in value also and on the last day of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to intrinsic value so you will be ahead in the play even after you buy it back.

The buyer has the rights and the seller the obligations. With index options the basic ideas are the same. Index options allow you to make investment decisions on a specific market industry or on the market as a whole. Spread strategies can be made with index options similar to those made with individual stock options. Many professional traders employ index spreads as a hedge strategy. We favor debit positions on the SPX for momentum and longer-term plays and OTM credit spreads on the OEX when the risk/reward is favorable. Low ROI disparity spreads will be listed (when available) for the conservative index trader. ******************************************************************* OEX - S&P 100 Index  $616.46     OTM Credit-Spreads The Standard & Poor's 100 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 100 stocks from a broad range of industries. The component stocks are weighted according to the total market value of their outstanding shares. The impact of a component's price change is proportional to the issue's total market value, which is the share price times the number of shares outstanding. OBSERVATIONS: For OTM credit spread trades, we like to use the actively-traded S&P 100 Index options because they contain much more premium than options on individual stocks and provide an underlying instrument less prone to huge, gapping moves. Remember however, that you can always be exercised early so monitor your positions daily. TECHNICALS: The overall market seems likely to remain in a wide trading range over the next few weeks and the long-term outlook is for a two-way market with somewhat neutral bias. Secondary issues are performing well but big-caps continue to suffer. The DOW and the S&P 500 both remain above their 30 wma's and over 50% of all stocks are now in stage II. The call/put ratio is slightly pessimistic so there may be some upside testing before any further correction. Review the OEX trading pit for more specific technical information on the S&P 100 Index.

I gues= s their reserves were?as limited as my wife's checking account since less t= welve hours?later they announced they would float the Real on a temporary?b= asis in order to protect their reserves. Sounds like a?contradiction to me.= So why did the markets rebound instead of?crash as analysts had predicted?= ??Ask ten analysts and you will get ten different answers but the?two most = common are ""it took a level of uncertainty out of the?market"" and ""relief t= hat the free market forces would now determine?the level of the Real and no= t artificial stability enforced by the?government"". The first one makes no = sense at all. On Thursday the?Dow crashed -228 points on worries that Brazi= l MIGHT float. So?on Friday they floated and because there was no uncertain= ty left?the market exploded? Lost me there. The second reason make much?mor= e sense. Brazil has been fighting the flight of funds from the?country by r= aising interest rates to a crushing 40% or more. How?would you like to have= that kind of credit card interest? How?can a country survive paying 40% on= it's debt? It can't, not for?long. The relief shown in Brazil markets was = immediate and huge.?The Bovespa surged +1,690 points or +33.41%. That would= be the?equivalent of +3,123 point Dow day. (please, please, just let?me be= fully invested the night before!!) I bet they are still?celebrating in Bra= zil today. Yes their money is worth less but?now they can at least kep more= of it. The remaining problem is?with Chile, Argentina, and the other close= ly linked South American?countries. They will be watching the Real and if i= t sinks fast?then they will be forced to devalue as well. The dominos are?a= lready lining up. All eyes will be on the support given to?Brazil by the U.= S. and the IMF in the coming weeks to see if?the Real can stand on it's own= or become a blackhole, sucking?everyone in South America down with it.??No= w back to our reality. The market, for whatever reason,?exploded Friday, th= e day before a long weekend, when it should?have been cautious. Remember th= e oversold conditions we talked?about on Thursday. The rubber band analogy = I used last week on?the +500 point gain also works on a -500 point loss. Wh= en?markets get stretched so tight either way there has to be a?relief day w= here things snap back to normal. We experienced?that Friday. I have been pr= eaching the return of the January?bull market rally after the profit taking= for over a week.?Surprise, it is back! Those of you who bought the dip on?= Thursday are looking pretty smart today.??The Nasdaq actually finished up f= or the week! Tech stocks?rebounded strong and were really not supported by = the Internet?stocks. Some Internets were up Friday but the majors were?stil= l taking profits. Speaking of major Internet stocks, we?are starting YHOO a= gain today for the split run. Yahoo dropped?-98 points in the last four day= s but closed +$13 off it's?Friday lows. The 2:1 split is Friday Feb 5th, on= ly three?weeks away. We know the Internets have had several downgrades?in t= he last week but they were only downgraded on price, not?performance. Those= of you who have the ability to trade YHOO?should look for an entry point t= his week. Don't blindly jump?in on Tuesday. Confirm lack of downward moveme= nt first.??We had a conference at the office here last week with many?of th= e newsletter contributors coming in from all over the U.S.?We were planning= the first Option Investor Seminar in February.?(details below) What really= came out of the planning process?was the need to educate traders on ""trend= trading"" (not trend?holding) and setting profit goals. While all this will= be?discussed in detail at the seminar there is a real need based?on the em= ail we get to touch on some of the concepts here.??Let me try an analogy fo= r trend trading. The market is like?the waves on the ocean. If you are stan= ding on one of the?major surfing beaches you will see wave after wave come?= crashing through. Between each major wave is a period of?calm which may hav= e several smaller waves. If you have ever?stood in the surf you are familia= r with the sensation called?undertow. This is when the water rushes back ou= t to sea in?preparation for the next wave. Now picture yourself with a?desi= re to surf. You have seen people do it. You go to a?surfboard shop and buy = a board. You ask the salesman if?surfing is hard. No problem, he says. Lay = on the board,?swim out in the surf, catch a wave, stand up on the board?and= surf back in. Easy! Now I ask you, can you surf? If you?are like most begi= nner surfers you get out to the waves but?now you feel more like a piece of= driftwood bobbing in an?endless sea than a human mastering the art of surf= ing. You?are battered, soaked, tired and more likely then not pretty?frustr= ated with being abused by every wave you tried to?catch. Options trading is= like surfing. Trading, the salesman?says, is easy. You just open an accoun= t, (board), jump in?the market (ocean), catch a wave (stock), buy some call= s?(surf), and end up safely on the beach (profit). NOT!?Most beginning trad= ers think it is this easy. Most end up?on the rocks (broke).??What we want = to teach you is to be a successful trader, not?a buy and holder. When you a= re learning to surf you probably?practice on hundreds of smaller waves. Eac= h one moving you?only a few yards before you fall and have to start over.?L= earning how to trade is the same way. You should try to?catch many small mo= ves and practice improving your skills?before attempting the long run to th= e beach. I am constantly?besieged by email on new people expecting to buy a= $3 option?and sell it for $15. That would be the equivalent of swimming?ha= lf a mile off shore, catching a fifty foot wave and surfing?all the way to = the beach on your first try. It just does not?happen. What we have tried to= teach people in the past it to?take a small profit many times instead of a= large profit once.??For those that are mathematically challenged let me il= lustrate.?If you start with a $10,000 account and generate a 10% profit?eve= ry week for a year, WITHOUT COMPOUNDING, after twelve months?you would have= over $60,000. If you COMPOUND the 10% then you?would have over $1,000,000.= At just 10% a week! Now before you?start firing off those emails I know yo= u can't compound 10%?every week. First you may hit some losers now and then= but?you are also going to hit some bigger winners more often. Just?to illu= strate. If you bought an option for $5.00 and sold it?for $5.50 that is a 1= 0% profit. Now how many times have you?bought an option and watched it go u= p $1-$2 and then slip?back down again the next day? More often than not! No= w, if?you had put in a sell for $6.00 that is a 20% profit and?probably wou= ld fill the same day. If you did that twice a?week, how much would that be = a week. CLUE 40% Now if you?could get only 10% or $.50 per week compounded = over a year?it would be over $1,000,000. Is $.50 hard to do over and?over a= nd over? Of course not. Is 40% possible? absolutely.?The real number is som= ewhere in between.??It is only hard to do if you HOLD and not TRADE. How fa= r are?you going to get if you just hold on to your surf board with?both han= ds for dear life? You will be pushed to and fro?wherever the ocean (market)= takes you. Sometimes you will?be pushed to the beach (profit) or onto the = rocks (broke)?or drift out to sea never to be seen again. (clueless)??Now t= hat I have completely lost my train of thought let's?get to the point. Ever= y stock ebbs and flows. Remember the?3-5-7 trend cycle from last week? Up t= hree days, down one,?up five days, down three, up seven days, down five. Ev= ery?stock will normally trade in one of these cycles. The trick?is to buy t= he stock on the down side and sell it on the up?side. Again, you do not hav= e to be in the market every day.?It is better to only be in the market WHEN= THERE IS PROFIT?TO BE MADE. Everything else is noise. Sometimes expensive?= noise. Learn to play the trends. Watch a stock for several?days. Study the = charts. Watch the intraday charts. Learn?how it moves. I traded TXN early l= ast year for a month.?It would always jump up at the open, wander during th= e day?and drop at the close. For weeks I would sell at the open?for a $.50 = to $1.00 profit and then buy the same option?back at the close for almost w= hat I had paid for it the?day before. Day in and day out. Cash flow. 10% a = day.?(don't even bother to compound that) In this current bull?market there= are many, many stocks that you can make 10%?or more a day just trading the= trends. The larger your?account becomes the easier it gets. You can start = taking?5% a day. For instance, look at a CSCO chart or an ASND.?Can you see= any way possible to not have made a $1.00 a?day, two or three days a week,= just trading those stocks???The positive trend is the key. Find a stock wi= th a trend,?pick and option, WAIT for an entry point, set a limit sell.?Rep= eat, repeat, repeat, repeat......??I want 10 volunteers. Pick a stock or tw= o, practice the?above plan and send me your results. I will publish the?res= ults and give each of you a years free subscription.?Obviously I will have = 15,000 emails tomorrow volunteering?and I can't take you all. The first 10 = with verifiable?results will qualify. It does not matter whether you trade?= one contract or one hundred. The key is the pattern. No?fair using past res= ults. All trades must be after today.?Trade confirmations must be available= .??When I publish these results you will never look at a?mutual fund claimi= ng a 25% annual return again. How can?they brag about beating the S&P!! I w= ould be embarrassed.??I have not seen any earth shaking economic news so fa= r?this weekend and the Fed does not meet again till February?so I would exp= ect the rally we had Friday to continue next?week. I am excited and you sho= uld be also. Earnings are?starting to flow and we have many split candidate= s in the?next 2-3 weeks. This is the perfect time to be in the?market. If y= ou don't profit from it you should be in?mutual funds.??Good Luck???Jim Bro= wn?Editor???************?JIM'S PLAYS?************?What a nightmare week! Ju= st goes to show that the best laid?plans of mice and men sometimes go astra= y. Everything was?looking so good moving into last week. We expected a litt= le?profit taking and then off to the races again. Little did we?expect a mo= nster dip caused by Brazil at the end of the profit?taking. The put-credit-= spreads that were well on their way?to expiring worthless for a full profit= , suddenly were in?jeporday of being a serious liability. My INKT 150 puts = were?$30 out of the money on Monday and $10 in the money on?Wednesday! Ouch= . Short cover madness. The 130-puts still?expired worthless but I bit the b= ullet on the $150. Then?on Thursday the 50-contract MCHP $35 put credit spr= ead was?safely out of the money with MCHP at $41.50. The bid was?$.06 x.19.= Thursday night MCHP announced earnings and missed?their estimates by $.01.= BOOM! Down $8.00 Friday morning!?The bid is now $3.50 for an option I wrot= e for $.56.?Fortunately MCHP came back to close at $35.13. I covered the?50= contracts at $.38 30 min before the close and was happy?to get it. People = emailed me last month and asked why I?had closed several put spreads severa= l days early for .25?or less when I could have let them expire worthless. T= his?was why. Always take a profit when one is available and you?will never = lose money. Holding an option long term is like?suicide. The trade will blo= w up on you when you least expect?it.??The $45 NEON put credit spread was c= losed at .25 for almost?a maximum profit.??I closed the ATI calls for a sub= stantial loss after the bidders?started dropping out. Had I held until Frid= ay I could have?broken even.??I will probably get criticized for the follow= ing but I have?suffered in the past from not selling in the face of seeming= ly?very bad news and did not want to have history repeat itself.?When the f= irst Asian problem occurred in Oct 1997 I was heavily?invested and did not = sell. I thought it was no big deal and?would bounce back in a day or two. I= woke up at the open on?the biggest drop day to see the futures lock limit = down at?-27 and Dow futures out of sight. It was a disaster and by?not sell= ing at the open I lost almost three times as much.?So the point of the stor= y was I did not want to be holding?if Brazil was going to explode the world= economy again.??I took a bloodbath Wednesday morning and sold at the low f= or?the day. The good news was that I was in cash for the rebound.?Once I re= alized that the bull market was viewing this as a?buying opportunity I jump= ed right back in.

That sounds right to me - we were going to pay for extra trips (like the ENA legal conference int eh fall) but this meeting is for all lawyers so they would have to pay for this regardless. Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/10/2000 07:06 AM 
I am preparing my RSVP form and was wondering what Company I would be listed under and RC/Cost Center I would be using?  Should I use Enron Expat Services and the RC number used for my payroll or ENA or ESA?  I don't remember how this was allocated last year.   Thanks. 
Jan:  Thanks for your note.  Tim Belden has asked Dana to book a conference room - maybe you can coordinate with her.  It might also be nice if there is a spare office or two that could be booked for the day (including the morning) so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings.  The only people I know of coming from out of town will be me and Ken Raisler, a lawyer with Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.  We will have a better idea of any audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date. JAN M KING 02/09/2000 12:30 PM 
Mark:  If there is anything you need in the way of facilities for this meeting, please let me know.  I would be happy to assist.

Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination. Let me know what you think.

I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next week?  Do you know if everyone will be in those days? (I was thinking Sao Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A. Thurs/Fri). Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/14/2000 10:53 AM 
Here is my proposed response.  Let me know if you want to mention the last item or not.  Thanks. Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that in the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian issues as well. Brent 
FYI 
Mark I would follow the Canadian model for the UK and would endorse Scott's views about the sophistication of the UK courts. Deals done on the ISDA form, where Engish law is agreed, will automatically bring the parties to the English courts. I think we should also consider the position under our continental power documents and perhaps think about crystallising in writing a policy on this area which is more trading oriented than the existing policy. Paul 
Scott: The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up in court in a jurisdiction in Europe. Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London. Thanks, Mark Scott Sefton 01/11/99 04:08 AM 
My sense is that the market custom here is to use the English courts, not arbitration. I think the English commercial court judges are pretty sophisticated and would be able to work through the issues. Since Paul is out this week, I haven't had a chance to speak to him about this. Let's wait to hear his views when he returns to the office. Thanks! 
Richard: In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts (where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it. Thanks, Mark

I'm afraid I disagree with Justin but prefer not to do so publicly.  It seems to me we need a verifiable end time for the Auction Period and should choose a time and a time zone that makes sense for the traders and counterparties (presumably UK for EnBank but Central for emissions credits). 
Mark/Dave, Many thanks for tha attachment, which I agree with.  As for the point about time, I would specify something like ""prevailing local time""........ Regards Justin

Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?  It seems to me we should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have access.  If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade UK derivatives should have access. Mark 
Justin, I am assuming that there is no reason from a legal perspective to restrict access to EnronOnline EnBank Auctions - so we will proceed with setting up the user profiles this way (I've already checked with credit). Please let me know if this is assumption is incorrect and we need to restrict access. Thanks, Dave 
It turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits but rather the EnBank UK synthetic gas storage product.  They want this auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the expiration time.  There is still no commitment to sell anything.  All transactions will be for sales by Enron to the counterparty.  I have taken a stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind. 
Here's a stab at tthe procedures which provides for hte ability to revise or revoke bids during the auction period. Comments? 
FYI 
thanks mark - the contracts are physical, and as a result all C/Ps that trade UK physical gas can have access. j

I'm not sure which ""process"" you are referring to.  I have not yet seen a list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal review.  The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is unclear).  The ""soft"" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US. For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on both sides of the walls.

Credit are pushing to launch online credit trading for this coming Monday. Have you both ""signed off"" on the process, or are there issues outstanding which need to be resolved, from your point of view? Dave 
With the final comment from Sullivan & Cromwell: 
Yes, this looks better to me. David Forster 02/16/2000 10:21 AM 
Mark, Further to our conversation the other day, are you happy for us to change the following in the GTC screen in EnronOnline: Old:  ""(Guest Users will view Generic GTCs which are shown for information

Are either of you guys aware of this web-site?  It looks like our weather people have put this out on the web ahead of us.  I think we need to talk to them about what they are allowed to post and what sorts of disclaimers should be there as well.  I just wanted to check with you before I call the weather desk here Mark 
I'm not sure I agree with you.  There is a big difference between listing the price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.  The almost public nature of the marketing  may influence whether or not the reference entity is happy with Enron trading the product.  Even if they are not affected in this way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high ground if the reference entity later decides to object. Louise Kitchen 02/16/2000 03:49 PM 
Remove all references to EnronOnline its unnecessary in this context - suffice to say you will be trading through all the normal Enron methods. Louise Bryan Seyfried 16/02/2000 20:24 
Attached is the letter that we intend to send to CFO/Treasurers of reference credits.  The section on EnronOnline was recommended by Sullivan and Cromwell and reviewed by Goddard, Dilworth and Simons. There may be a few minor edits before it goes out. Thanks bs 
I finally got my film developed - this gives you an idea of how often I use the camera - and thought you might like these.  Unfortunately the only shot on the roll of Bruce didn't turn out - directly attributable to the photographer's lack of skill - and we never did have anybody take a group shot.  There were several others that you can tell would have been great shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens.  The sunset was taken during our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the picture was taken (if you listen carefully, you can almost hear Ted losing his lunch down below). Hope you guys are well - any trips to Houston on the agenda? Mark 
Edmund: Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of questions and minor points ont eh GTC - In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed confirmation to control over other evidence. Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions should not be included when they determine their rights to call for collateral under the masters. I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is this particular to credit derivatives? With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to ""deactivate"" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction? If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC would acknowledge that the master did not control.) I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to more than 60 days). I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term ""Month.""  What would the Effective Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March. The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day convention. This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a different interest rate to non-US$ payments? It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC. Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we decided not to include one here for a particular reason? Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any of these points. Mark Edmund Cooper 02/15/2000 10:29 AM 
Dear Gavin, Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.  I have marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small tidy-up changes as well. I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references to ""the United States"" in Section 11(B) should remain as references to ""the United Kingdom"" in the non-US and non-Canadian GTCs.  Please let me know if this is unclear. Unless you have any comments on these revisions, please could you prepare amended versions of the GTCs in anticipation of any final changes from local counsel. Many thanks, Edmund. 
There are a few points in here that you might be interested in - or not.

I received the proposed list of reference entities today.  Here is a draft of a memo that I cobbled together to use in trying to get input from others within Enron for the restriced list.  Would you let me know what you think? I will be meeting with Mark H. tomorrow to talk with him about it.  It isn't clear to me who should receive this and from whom it should come.  Since the communications people may have relationships with some of these folks, is Kristina the right person?  I know that EES has some kind of joint venture with AOL - should Vicki sign off?  If it is going to such persons, should the memo come from Mark?  Cliff Baxter?  John Sheriff?  Jim Derrick?

My recollection is that we did this on purpose - that the industry works this way for all participants (or nearly all) so we built our documents to reflect that practice.  Do I remember correctly? 
All, I am aware that early in the EnronOnline process, some GTC's were only generated for the ""With Collateral"" category and hence, all companies transacting in that commodity were subject to the collateral clause. I am now starting to wonder if this was an oversight, or if there is a reason why all counterparties should be bound by a collateral clause for the following GTC's/Products: I would appreciate any insight which any of you can offer. Thanks, Dave 
I think we're talking about a Senior Legal Specialist position.  Do you have the posting that we used last year (when we hired Susan Flynn)?  I think it would have gone out in July or August. 
Please review and make any changes. 
I just called Diomedes' office to try and get on his calendar next week. They told me he is not there and won't be back until after Carnival which I guess means March 9 at the earliest.  I am in Portland the 6th & 7th (Mon. & Tues.) and Amsterdam the 13th - 17th (Tues. - Fri.).  Unless an emergency comes up it looks like the earliest I can reasonably expect to make it will be towards the end of March (27 - 31?). Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/18/2000 06:53 AM 
Mike will be here next Thursday and Friday.  I am not sure of anyone's schedule in Sao Paulo.  Please note though that Mike has scheduled an offsite for BA office next Friday afternoon to discuss the goals for this next year.   No one will be around the office most of Friday.  Does it make sense to flip the order of visits? Mark Taylor@ECT 14/02/2000 07:30 PM 
I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next week?  Do you know if everyone will be in those days? (I was thinking Sao Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A. Thurs/Fri).

Here is my proposed response.  Let me know if you want to mention the last item or not.  Thanks. Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that in the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian issues as well. Brent

I just looked at the first couple of documents attached and wanted to make sure the second item listed in them works.  Is everyone comfortable that the volume should be submitted in megawatts and then divided in half to produce megawatt hours?  I think it works but I had to work through it to get there - it wasn't immediately obvious to me.
