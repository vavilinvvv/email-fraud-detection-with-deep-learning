saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that has to be reflected in h/j. slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/13/2000 04:15:51 PM 
mkt getting a little more bearish the back of winter i think-if we get another cold blast jan/feb mite move out. with oil moving down and march closer flat px wide to jan im not so bearish these sprds now-less bullish march april as well. 
amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year. will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts? slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/08/2000 12:05:54 PM 
i suck-hope youve made more money in natgas last 3 weeks than i have. mkt shud be getting bearish feb forward-cuz we already have the weather upon us-fuel switching and the rest shud invert the whole curve not just dec cash to jan and feb forward???? have a good weekend john 
We both thank you

Savita: A couple of issues: 1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system? 2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm restricted right now by issue #1. Please advise,

Oh yea, I always get those two places confused. 
pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect these days.  Too much, probably. The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude. These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made a penny. Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe. slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/13/2000 09:42:43 AM 
cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out know who's doing what! im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01 and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that to heart. here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonna be up 1-1.5 bcf by year end. does increased deliverabilty mean these winter sprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be more concerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese will not be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius your thots-i maybe thinking too much but makes some sense to me-have a good weekend johnny. pira says decm 01 prod up 3 bcf y on y! 
of course... just kidding.  Aldo's next week. you're done.  Open up your checkbook baby.

sure 
John, Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would like to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) - so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your offer. Regards, Gary x31511 John Arnold 10/08/2000 02:05 PM 
I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week.

Once it comes in Jay Webb and Don Adams of IT and EOL will make sure that everything you need will be programmed on your computer. 2. I I have ordered your t.v for the office 3. I am working with telerate department on how you will be able to access it from your home. 4. Polycom is installed in your office 5.

Hey: I hope you know we were just kidding with you yesterday.  We don't get many strangers on the floor so we have to harass them when we do. I think I am a couple of the ""we are not"" attributes in your book.  Is that going to cause me any problems going forward? 
I've got your tix.  Just two though.  I left them in my car.  Can you walk

John & Mike, Could you please fill out the attach spreadsheet COB today?  There is one swap term and one collar term. It looks like we are getting close to a finance deal and are working with John Thompson in the finance group.  The outline quotes would be a buy out of existing deals on Enron's books.

Absolutely.  Come by around 3:30?? 
how about 4:45?

J. Arnold- Hey - It's me!  Any luck with the tickets?????  Just curious if there any way I can get four tickets instead of two?  I know I'm asking alot but I really appreciate it.  You know how much I love the Counting Crows and last time they were in town someone was going to take me but the plans fell through..........Thanks!!!!!!! Jennifer 
I was long 4000 X @ 4902, then I switched it from X to F at the same price. I switched it at 5000, but it puts me into the F at a price basis of 4902. Sorry for the confusion. Enron North America Corp. 
I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week. 
Adam: Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct. The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful. It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address. John ""Bayer, Adam Ryan"" <adam.r.bayer@vanderbilt.edu> on 10/03/2000 01:23:01 PM 
Dear Mr. Arnold, It was nice to meet you yesterday at the information session.  Thank you for the dinner last night. I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in a more relaxed setting. During out conversation yesterday, I was confused about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of your time on the phone with Traders in New York.  When you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron Online?  I think the underlying question that I am asking, is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job, or is it meant to bypass traders completely. Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward to talking with you again when you come to campus for interviews. Cordially, Adam ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bayer, Adam Ryan Vanderbilt University Email: adam.r.bayer@Vanderbilt.Edu

A funny story: Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the exchange stopped trading for an hour. Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange closing.  One yelled at Rappaport... 
Something to take a look at

John: The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing. My short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural appears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is  poor, particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The  market appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If  we are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely  bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.   Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger picture is still  very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would  call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move to the  upside. Let me know if this stuff is useful for you. I certainly  don't want to waste your time. In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have something to pass along, let me know. I don't know how often you  check/see your e-mail. Thanks, Mark Sagel

John: I have asked Mike and Larry to spend half an hour each talking to you about opportunities on the gas floor.  Please advise if the following schedule is unacceptable.  I will be leaving today at 2:15. Larry 4:00-4:30 Mike 4:30-5:00 Thanks,

John- What do you think of getting a direct mic from New York to Houston as soon as possible?  We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked great.  You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up. The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded. We could keep it between you and Mike. We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them who will need quicker execution.  I know you and Per have discussed the idea of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer. I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an update of who we are planning to trade with. Best Rgds, Caroline 
Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as someone ""who thinks outside the box"".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty. I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products. Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise. Thanks, 
Can you swap me with Fletch.  Try to make all of my interviews as late as possible. Thx John 
Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange. One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec

Jim: I apologize for the comment after your order.  I knew you didn't like the market last night so I was surprised when you were an buyer this morning. It's not your style to change views quickly as you tend to trade with a longer term view.   I was out of line with the comment and it won't happen again.

Hello: I am John Arnold.  I believe you're looking for Jeff Arnold. pfse@dynegy.com on 09/27/2000 05:30:27 PM 
jeff, thanks for the directions - i have already forwarded them home. tonight is not good for me but perhaps one day we will finally connect now that we are closer! i've been thinking about sunday and hope you have a deck of cards to play with (perhaps 2 decks of uno cards). 
I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there. Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact. Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car thief.

John: I don't mind cleaning up their books at quarter end.  However,at year end I will want to keep the debt off of my books.  As we approach year-end this year could you please coordinate with Joe Deffner so that we take advantage of the margin lines we have available in order to minimize the debt on our books. Thanks, Ben John Arnold 09/26/2000 07:12 PM 
Ben: Jeff Shankman gave me your name.  I have assumed Jeff's old responsibilities as head of the natural gas derivatives trading group.  Our broker, EDF MAN, supplies us with $50 million of margin financing every night.  They are trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on Sep 30. They have asked if we can post the $50 million overnight on the 30th.  We did this last year as well.   Please advise, John 
I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could produce that effect. The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into the winter.

Hey freak: So we finally had LA type weather here for the past two days.  Highs in the mid-70's.  Beautiful.  Life's just cruising along.  Nothing new.  I put a bid in for a condo in a new mid-rise building going up in West U that they accepted.  If all goes as expected I'll move in next X-Mas.  So are you adjusting to the big city.

John: ? I wish I had a lot to pass along, but not much has changed on  my work.? All the analysis is still very bullish and expecting higher  levels.? I am receiving hourly ""9"" type strength patterns, which means the  up move must consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows  is a negative for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type  of strength pattern today.? It is not a ""9"" type topping pattern, but one  that normally comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would  suggest a potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major importance. ? I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October  19.?

Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could have done.  I believe you are one of those individuals.  I appreciate what you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on.  This especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 months.  You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX liquidity to cover your risk.  I would like to offer to transfer $30 million out of the Storage Book to the Price Book.  Without you and EOL I could never have done what I've done. Thanks, Jim Schwieger

Greg: The guy from MG whom I spoke to about clearing was Alfred Pennisi, VP of Operations.  He's out of NY.   He indicated his clearing costs were $3.10 
Dave: A couple things about the limit orders: 1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible. Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour. Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise. 2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size. When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the quantity to be 15,000. 3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system saying error trade, price not available. 4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a valuable feature. Thx,

I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is $3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer. Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin

URGENT The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure will be reviewed during these two hours sessions. It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of 40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month of September and end at mid October. Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst recruiting teams. In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be given for attending this workshop.

Dear AEDC Member, One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  This standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and examining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more comparable than ever before. A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to see how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25 tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the bottom of the page will access the additional tables. You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for the standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which approach works best for you. Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic development profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't received the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to tell their story. If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the standards and their use.

Warren Tashnek called to say that the documents for the credit line will not be available until next week.  It seems that all of Soc Gen's Paris office is on holiday for the month of August so the  credit proposal for the Enron facility is gathering dust on someone's desk until they return. Mary Cook is working on t he brokerage agreement between Fimat and Enron. That should be done in about a week. 
Just FYI, whether it matters or not, but commissions in gas average $3-4 a contract.  Not sure about power. Andy Zipper@ENRON 08/28/2000 04:10 PM 
While we are putting this card together I thougth you guys might like to see some of the imputed commission numbers.......I thought we would cut it off at $100,000 saved. I'm using an average rate of $10 per 10,000 mmbtu gas and power equivalent. 
Rahil: I have never commented favorably nor unfavorably about Kase's newsletter.   I think publishing independent market evaluations could be beneficial.  The more interesting content that is published, the better.

Under the alternative ""bumping"" method, if the market is 3.75/5.25 and our EOL and ICE market's are both 4/5 in that case, would we pay brokerage if someone executes on ICE rather than EOL? Fletch 
Thanks 
Ted: Lavorato wanted me to check on the $5,000,000 VAR extension.  Is it possible to get this extended indefinitely until the west basis market settles down? We will have a good percentage of the west position rolling off over the next week as well as indices get published.  Please advise ASAP. 
Dave: Just a reminder, can you send me a list of grandchildren to my products. Also, is it possible to systems-wise deny grandchildren to a specific product to ensure that the rule is enforced? 
Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which system you like better. Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly. I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving

CONGRATULATIONS David P Dupre 11/28/2000 09:02 PM 
As a recent transfer into the analyst program, I have moved to a new group: EnronCredit.com, based in London but I will be working here.   I will be working mainly with credit derivative traders. I am at the same phone number, 3-3528, and completely enjoyed my role working with you in the Nymex checkout function for the past 1 1/2 years. Joe Hunter will be taking my place while a replacement is found. Best wishes to each of you at Enron. David 
Hey: Can you send me the file that you produced of those names so I can shrink it down a little? Thanks, 
How about Tuesday at either 6:45 am or 2:15 pm my time. David Redmond 08/25/2000 07:26 AM 
John, Mike, As you may know I recently moved from the Calgary office to the London office. The vol curve here is marked very similarly to the Nymex curve at the front but drops off to a much lower level at the back. Richard Lewis, who is in charge of UK Gas and Power trading, would like to discuss the rationale behind the longer end of the NG curves, both vol and price. Could we all get on the phone sometime next week (Monday is a holiday here) perhaps before the open or shortly after the close? (The Nymex closes at 8pm UK time.) Thanks, Dave 
Ina: Did you find out the info on the ENA management committee> 
Dave: I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a way to generate false P&L? 
Thanks, have a good time but no interest.. John David P Dupre 08/24/2000 05:00 PM

Fine Ina Rangel 08/22/2000 02:08 PM 
Carolyn Gilley who is a department head in our records management group has hired the firm, Millican & Assoicates to come in and compile all of our current and archived files into a more suitable fileplan.  Enron has given permission for this firm to handle this, but they need further approval from each one of you to deal with your backoffice people and with your assistants in compiling this information to complete their project.  Below is a more detailed letter from the firm explaining their work here. Please respond to me that I have your approval to give for them to complete your project. Thank You, Ina Rangel 
Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project: We are records and information management consultants from Millican & Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff. There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be maintained. Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and then use the ""imaged"" document viewable from your computer as the working copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call. Thank you. Sara Bolken X35150

Z/F !!!!   wow.    Who would have thunk it.  Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it couldn't do it this year.... A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it going to zero? slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AM 
agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up buying em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time is busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have the time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called impact of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate at all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon. also will be curious how these ""loan deals"" by pipes work ouut. man these guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in the back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep that part of the curve very strong agree? be cool my man-talk later

Yeah yeah I know.... The roll out for phase II EOL is (for now) 8/28/00. Options are qeued next after that. Unfortu ately I wish I could give you a hard date, but it is out of my hands and in Jay Webb's shop. I am pushing as hard as I can but Louise has set phase II as the priority. I know this sounds like a lame excuse, but I don't know what else to say. The application is built, it just needs to be tested. Please don't get too frustrated and keep the pressure up on us. Andy

Hello, Just checking to see if things are progressing as scheduled. Thanks, John 
By Fiona O'Brien LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The head of the largest yet Internet exchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymity with transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity. The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August 24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go live soon afterwards. While market transparency will increase as dealers used to over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview. ""As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both counterparties,"" he said. ""The real strength is that you (still) get the ability to manage your own counterparties.

Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions, it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system not supplying us with that info. Andy Zipper@ENRON 07/31/2000 01:51 PM 
John, As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your thoughts/concerns. -Andy

FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll keep chasing it.  Per John Arnold 07/07/2000 08:50 AM

Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently.  But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side. While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following: 20%  $ -.05 40%     $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1 Enron North America Corp.

By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should discuss, but they should not get in the way of release. If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august. any questions please feel free to call. -andy

Hello: A recent posting on the Enron bulletin board indicated that you are looking for academic tutors.  I may be available to help at nights in math.  Can you please respond with details about the program, how old the kids are, the commitment required, etc. Thanks, 
Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up. Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out. If we get two low injections, watch out. Enron North America Corp. 
Frank: Just following up on two topics. One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs. Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer term Vol problem until we change formulas? 
Margaret: As you can imagine, most information and procedures on the floor are extremely confidential.  We look at the gas market uniquely and using different tools than anybody else.  It is one of our competitive advantages. I'm hesistant to approve the use of any documents for external purposes. If you provide more information about what you're trying to show, who the target audience is, and what format it will be presented, I may be able to help you.

Per Share http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000711/tx_el_paso_2.html Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69, an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million in the year-ago period. EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT. ``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to accelerate in the second quarter.'' For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515 million in the year-ago period. Second Quarter Business Segment Results The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed to the record second-quarter performance. The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and $19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day. The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million, nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March 2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d. Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3 TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement filed in March. The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's investment in the Philippines. Telecom Update ``We have made substantial progress in the development of our telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A. Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses, we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the telecommunications marketplace.'' Quarterly Dividend The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October 2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000. With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units: Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing, and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the completion of regulatory reviews.

I spoke to Vlady this afternoon regarding the alternative VAR methodologies. I think changing to a Riskmetrics historical VAR system is more defendable and objective, will provide more consistent results, and will create more realistic results.  I understand Vince has a similar opinion.

Hey Liz, Thanks for letting me use the phone.  A real life-saver. My brother had a Nokia world phone on the trip and it seemed to work better.   It got reception some places where mine did not and is more user-friendly. On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a flight in December to Australia.  He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for half.   Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half.  I haven't expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on. Thanks, John Liz M Taylor 06/28/2000 09:27 AM 
John, We are testing the Nextel phone for company usage.  What did you think of the phone? Liz

Hi, John, following up the discussion with you on Friday we talked with Risk Control people who are not excited to use that FF vol curve you sent to me. Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them for all the locations. The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol curves from historical data. I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price curves for NG and all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor. I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers based on these curves: 5/30/00  5/31/00 AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000 AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761 AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685 AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225 You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which would give more weight to recent data. We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor. Tanya. John Arnold 06/07/2000 07:40 AM 
Tanya: On Friday I emailed a new vol curve to use for VAR testing.  I was under the impression that you could apply this vol curve to the price book and storage book and have a new experimental VAR number by Monday. I have not received any response.  Please reply with status of this project. John

Please use this vol curve for a dry run to figure out var for my book, NG 
Let's meet at 4:00. Vince J Kaminski 06/01/2000 09:19 AM 
John, We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues. The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26 where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process. It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis, jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position. This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a big jump in VaR. This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look at column D. The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to review the fwd vol curve before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol, it can be smoothed. Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings? Vince

Stupid taxes Bill White@ENRON 05/30/2000 04:52 PM 
Remember we were trying to figure out the difference in return between tax free investment growth and annually-taxed investment growth?  Turns out that it is different, but over 5 years and a 10% growth rate, it doesn't amount to much more than the cost of our beer tab.  See attached.

The bid on Henry Hub basis for same time period is -$.0025 resulting in fix price of $3.0075; the bid on Sonat basis is -$.0175 translating into a bid of $2.9925. Notional volume = 70,128 contracts.

Hey, I just got your email. Call anytime after 4:00. 
Please stop sending emails to jennifer_arnold to the following email address: jarnold@enron.com. 
Jeff: Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit confused by the question. In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas. Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable. I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level. 
Andy: The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options. Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money. Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves. In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just 
Hey: Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter. Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there. interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later. definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one year ago and not a significant loss of demand. market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low. Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 considering the scenario that's being painted. slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/21/2000 01:06:40 PM 
johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled all the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was long mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure. but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to mark silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. any great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it. guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling dry up?? 
Andy: Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the 
Thanks for taking me in last night.  Sorry about being drunk and stinky. 
Dutch: The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market. Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.

Andy: This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that, unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256. I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time. The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows: Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006 These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475. In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044 In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028 The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium table The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I

rules to a game: You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you $1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2? what you charge me play against you?)

rules to a game: You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you $1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2? what you charge me play against you?) 
most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock? $______ per/share

Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock? $______ per/share

IMPORTANT MEMO 
IMPORTANT MEMO Notice # 01-154 May 7, 2001 TO: All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") DATE: May 7, 2001 =========================================================== Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001, new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect. !    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members. !    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. !    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. !    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b)  the account number; (c)  the brokerage rate; (d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928, NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") (Entire rule is new.) Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. (A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members (1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice shall be retained by the Clearing Member. (2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly. (3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing Member, customer and the executing broker. (B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers (1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must: (a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures. 2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules. 3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g)  the account number; (h)  the brokerage rate; (i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. 4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing Member(s) of any such rejection. Carr Futures 150 S.

Russell: Just fyi, they're willing to take us for 20 years. 
i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here. still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here. 
maybe they're for more sophisticated palates 
Alan: I received your email.  I'll make sure it goes through the proper channels. It may help if you give specific positions that interest you most as Enron is such a big place, it will help focus the resume to the right people.

how about we celebrate the near completion of your deal and have tickleless pay for it. 
is that with or without two snoozes? 
Jennifer: I don't think we have much interest in doing this interview since it primarily pertains to our views of the market.  I would speak in such generalities that it probably wouldn't be a good interview. John Jennifer Walker@ENRON 05/07/2001 08:57 AM 
John: Kevin Foster with Risk Magazine is working on an article for the June issue regarding Gas Markets in the U.S. Basically, he is interested in Enron's opinion of: 1. Physical Supply/Demand of gas and how this is affecting financial trades 2. Where do we anticipate gas prices going over the summer? 3. The state of the industry--any major issues that may affect the market? If this sounds like a story we would be interested in doing, please let me know and I will coordinate a short phone interview with Kevin Foster. I know it usually works best for your schedule to do this after 4pm, so please let me know if Tuesday after 4 would be good for you. Thanks for your help and please call me with any questions.

Hey Adam: sorry for the delay.  just been very busy.  congrats on joining enron.  think you made the right chioce.  i would recommend structuring.  it's a good way to understand how enron works, how we look at and manage risk, and you get close to the trading component.  a friend of mine, ed mcmichael runs the gas structuring group.  try emiling him probably at emcmich@enron.com.  keep in touch, john ""Bayer, Adam Ryan"" <adam.r.bayer@vanderbilt.edu> on 04/10/2001 03:06:34 PM 
Hi John, I hope your gas markets are moving nicely this week.  Its been a long time since we talked, but a lot has happened. But the most important thing has been my decision to join Enron. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation, and I have received a lot of advice pointing me towards Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.  I am wondering if you know some people in these areas who might be looking for analysts.  I have heard that traders work closely with the structured finance and RAC guys, true?  If you have time please let me know if you know of anything. Thanks, Adam Bayer

Jeff: To explain the P&L of -349,000  : We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000. The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45. Looking out for you bubbeh: John

Jean: I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further.... thanks for the article.

John, I have just arrived in Houston, and will be running the LNG Trading & Shipping business. I worked for Louise for many years, and took over the European Gas business from her when she came over here a few years ago. I'd like to meet you and discuss a few issues. Do you have any time over the next few days? Thanks, Jonathan 
my numbers from mar 15.  would raise jun-augy by 10 cents because of the supportive weather we had from mar 15-apr 15 
are we first?  if not, when does the road show start and/or when does the basic theme get distributed around the industry? 
1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor. 2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity. 3. the obvious 4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall. 5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably. 
can you send jean a list of her seat numbers

i dont remember if we fixed these yet. 
John, Sorry again...  my last 2 trades (EOL # 1112587 & 1112596 - I sell 1/2 day twice @5.55 on May) were done again by mistake on US Gas Daily instead of NYMEX. I have called your help desk to try to remove US Gas Daily from my NYMEX screen which we cannot do so far unless I select each quote individually.  However this would run the additional problem of not showing up new tenors you may introduce over time.

the implied market on that from put spreads is 5.3:1.    I'll take 4:1. that's all the juice i'll pay. 
Average volume is 35,000-40,000 on nymex of which about half is spreads.  So around 20,000 outrights trade.  We trade more than that on EOL.  Today's conditions 1000 lot market would be 3-4 cents wide.  have executed trades as large as 10,000 across a longer term and 1000 lot clips in the front frequently.

John/ Mike- could you give me a sense of the below on nat gas.. thanks, ca 
This is a program trader in San Diego with about 1 Billion in Capital.  They concentrate on front month trading- both swaps and options.  they are looking for liquidity and want to know: 1. size of the financial markets- what is the daily trading volume like? 2. bid/offer on size.. like 10,000 to start and then 5,000..1,000 - only for the front month on swaps and options? 3. what kind of size we have seen go through directly from anyone? They want to know this for nat gas: I can talk to John and Mike on this Rus- can you please get this on WTI, heat, and unleaded. I want to try to get this to them today... we'll be getting a lot of these inquiries. Also, they trade through Carr futures, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, and JPM/Chase.. What they want to do is trade with us and then we'll give-up the trades to the above counterparties.. in effect, we will not have any credit exposure..I can explain this in our meeting. Thanks, CA 
Dave: I need a favor.  I'm trying to create an internal only Cal 2002 product for our power guys. Product controls is saying it will take  a week from monday 
the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not convinced this rally in products is different. 
what kind of odds.   the market is saying it's 8:1 chance.  I'm saying there is a much better chance than that.  i think it's 2:1 
2.75 ... but yea 
may = 495  the rest is the same

australia definitely sounds cool.  might be a little tough though. i'd be in for keemah if you want to do that 
I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable. Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat. I will keep you posted - John Arnold 04/08/2001 08:15 PM

i read this as though 1.5 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summer versus today.  is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 2 and contango for natty? 
Mike: Two questions regarding fees: 1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type investment into the hedge funds? 2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity. However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification? Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my above-market returns compromised by high fees. Thanks, 
planning on going.  which night are you inviting guys for? also, heard there were some issues about contract negotiations.  don't know specifics but if you want to discuss give me a call.  might be able to mediate this a little bit  if you want. Caroline Abramo@ENRON 03/30/2001 03:37 PM

Did the Palestinians settle with the Israelis? No.  Did Dan Reeves settle with John Elway? No.  Did Anna Nicole Smith settle with her in-laws? No. But Salomon Smith Barney and Enron have settled all the issues and have agreed to the $50 million credit facility.  The documents are in Mary Cook's capable hands and should be completed next week. In addition, I hope that Jon Davis' cooling demand presentation on Wednesday (3:15) will be valuable for your trading endeavors.  John Galperin (on our desk) will introduce Jon.  Try to stay awake during John's introduction.

maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is that relevant. Sarah Mulholland 04/04/2001 08:09 AM 
interesting comment from singapore........ hope things are going well up there. 
i was reading something interesting last week somewhere on states coping with the coming summer---the report was on the amount of ice -not huge enough from this winter to provide enough water for hydroelectricity during summer.farmers were encouraged to cultivate crops that consume less water-the first thing i can  think of is low sul fueloil as natgas will be well supported-thus european lsfo will be arbg to the states.just my thought-hi/low play worth watching

unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation. second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution. third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade. if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this helps, john Sharad Agnihotri 04/04/2001 12:44 PM 
John, Mike I work for the London Research team and am looking at some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk. Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had done some fundamental research regarding the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help. I would be grateful if you tell me what you have done or suggest someone else that I could ask. Regards Sharad Agnihtori

no not necessarily... just sick of her at the moment, 
you're right though...it seems like bo and i are always on the opposite side 
fyi : bo is a big put buyer and fence seller today.  though he is trying to defend j. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/29/2001 09:22:15 PM 
agree on view. as u cud tell i got a little less bearish for a bit so i delta hedged and day traded to keep from losing a ton, let go og the delta after aga number which was exactly on my forecast still implying 7.5 bcf swing(i actually thot it could have been worse so my range pre was 5-12 basis past cupla weeks aga. that said i with you took my lumps. having a very good month in petro helped me hold on to natgas shit p&l. got most of it back now tho.trying to be more patient. think we hold 5.20's  for another week or so-must be plenty chopped up traders mite mean we lose some momentum for a bit. what the hell was going on today between you and bo(seems i see this more and more)? how come he always seems to be fighting you on this stuff. if he would go the same way as you(and i) this mkt would just crap. either way im unwinding-gonna be making a jump soon(thats p&c for the moment). will keep u informed of course. power gen up 3% last week and cal rate hikes the kiss of death for demand in cal this summer i think John.Arnold@enron.com on 03/29/2001 07:45:02 PM 
Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way. Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up. 
In regards to gas: what signals do you for in determining your view? what resources do you use to formulate a price view? give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer. where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest level we've been at in past 5 years? what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market? what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? What do you expect in the next 5? how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given day? In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty What are delta/gamma/theta? if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero? Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts? If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal? what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if corresponding futures are trading $5? what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

John- My name is Clayton Vernon, and I am the Manager for Models and Forecasts for East Power Trading, reporting to Lloyd Will. I'm helping Research (and Toim Barkley) with a data visualization tool for EOL trades, and I wanted for you to know I'd like to make this product helpful for you. In doing so, I'd like to also let my colleagues Chris Gaskill/Hunter Shively avail themsevles of this tool. But, I need to find out if the desks are your colleagues or, as things shape up, your competitors, since some trades are between Enron desks. Can Chris/Hunter see synopses of all of our EOL gas trades, after the fact? Clayton Vernon

Mike: 
yea,  i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the loss of demand, which is in the first 4 inj numbers.  customer buying and fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level.  if my theory holds, eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes.  second puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis, demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you should, and early winter weather will not match 2000.  we develop large y/y surplus in x and z.  z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists for rest of winter.  by late december, just trying to find a home for gas. think decent chance f futures finish with a 2 handle. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/25/2001 08:16:26 PM 
f puts?? you mean january?  u mean june and january??? John.Arnold@enron.com on 03/25/2001 07:30:38 PM 
just when i'm turning really bearish you're starting to turn bullish on me. weather to me relatively unimportant.  yes, it will leave us with 30 bcf or so less in storage than if we had mild weather.  i think it is masking a major demand problem.  think what the aga numbers would be with moderate weather.  when we get into injections, i think we'll see a big push down. spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying still strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer, we haven't moved down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer (i.e. -when we start beating last year's injections by 20 bcf a week), trade will get short.  customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us is we're coming out 400 bcf less than last year, thus the summer has to be strong.  when we start inj, customers will start seeing other side of story.  pira finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me, the mrkt just a timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots get short.  i continue buying m,f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m 400. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/23/2001 01:44:10 PM 
this strength cud persist awhile-is a little bullish ngas demand since we now above parity in some places. shit theres so many things shaking my faith on the short bias of this thing. weather hot /west cold est, hydo, califronia,mkt talking new engl shortages.oil demand cont to show stellar y on y and curve recoveriung, opec hawkish stance for px support. i think we close the y on y gap still significantly but im starting to question how when,how much and how long prices come off in apr-jun? thanks god i can trade oil cuz i have made anything in ngas to speak of. short term still sort of neutral ngas-beleive we range bound. u prob know this but hearing texas rr data coming out pretty bearish prodcution-good news . regards

Warming Up To Green BY ERIC ROSTON Breathe in. Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out. Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you can't see your breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin box for the right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November, Murphy Oil Corp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago. The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross the zeds and umlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological terms--turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord was reached. In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of carbon (the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, and there isn't even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeed there isn't even unanimity on global warming itself. Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions trading system. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity. John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto target--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. ""This isn't an act of altruism,"" says Aidan

heffner how? was pretty long coming into today just playing the range.  sold everything on the way up.  will be s scale up seller probably through options. certainly a short squeeze in trade today and i don;t think anything changes tomorrow except maybe trade gets more confident in the short at the higher level and if cash rejects higher prices. will be buying lots of puts on the way up so i guess for me vol is not too high.  i was short vol and covered it all this morn.  think we could be in for some turbulence here slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/20/2001 10:48:43 AM

Debbie: If you have availability for either session, please sign me up.  I was unsu= re=20 I would be able to attend until now, hence the late notice. Thanks, John =20 Enron North America Corp.  
The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20 Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa= st=20 two years.  These informal, interactive forums will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year. Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have= =20 indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20 mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They= =20 also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i= ts=20 executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, = create a=20 =01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the= =01&same=20 page=018 about where Enron is going---and why. To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions: Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo= u=20 will attend only one session.) ______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M ______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work: ? Each session will have approximately 20 participants. ? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue. ? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20 presentations.=20 ? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20 questions and express your own opinions. ? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum= . ? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20 limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie= s,=20 projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,= =20 values, etc. Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20 encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20 intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d= o=20 the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20 you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20 Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20 Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these= =20 sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing, as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs= t=20 choices as much as possible. =20 Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20 e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806= . Thank you.

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term. As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis. 
Andy: Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you want to discuss. Andrew Fairley 03/13/2001 11:14 AM 
John Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with regard to EOL for UK gas. We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now). Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the strategy you mentioned below. Once again, thanks for your help All the best, Andy John Arnold 21/02/2001 04:26 
Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you. One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die. I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders. John Andrew Fairley 02/20/2001 11:15 AM 
Thank you so much for your time last week. David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several issues helpful for our own market. This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from our side of the pond. Best regards Andy 
heffner how? was pretty long coming into today just playing the range.  sold everything = on=20 the way up.  will be s scale up seller probably through options.  certainly= a=20 short squeeze in trade today and i don;t think anything changes tomorrow=20 except maybe trade gets more confident in the short at the higher level and= =20 if cash rejects higher prices. =20 will be buying lots of puts on the way up so i guess for me vol is not too= =20 high.  i was short vol and covered it all this morn.  think we could be in= =20 for some turbulence here slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/20/2001 10:48:43 AM

agree with contango story .   cash to futures pretty bullish but a picture where agressive inj now are bearish later.  so curve should flatten.  also back of curve (cal2,3) under a lot of pressure now.  customers will be buying all the way down and will get fucked just like last year.  contango has been under considerable pressure even with the front falling...any rally should result in those snapping in to 4.  good scalp in my opinion. definitely seeing your side on the $5 level.  surprised we havent gotten more demand back as we sit at these lower levels. off to cabo today for a long weekend.  kind of exhausted at work right now so a much needed break. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/15/2001 07:50:59 AM 
i wud think apr shud also start to find support from contangos, storage players, ie pretty attractive contangos given the bullsih mkt sentiment, and spec a little short will eventually roll. i bullspd a little little at 5.5 just for a scalp. if cash converges which it shud as we fall in px then shud see sprds find support at the 5-6 ct level/month? ? other than that-im still bearish-5 bucks not sustainable longer term and nothing yet telling me otherwise. economy and oil curve also not going to help ngas. buying 4.00 summer puts thanks for comments on utilites-i'll bet they buy all the way down but i think theyll have so much gas coming at em if we stay at these levels the mkt will ultiamtely force em to back down. in ny yest and today-saw the red hot chili peppers last nite , was awsome, small place about 1000 fans,maybe for a charity. also here for some of those covert operations we talked about a while back. wkup.

Sorry, have no idea. 
very funny today...during the free fall, couldn't price jv and xh low enough on eol, just kept getting cracked.  when we stabilized, customers came in to buy and couldnt price it high enough.  winter versus apr went from +23 cents when we were at the bottom to +27 when april rallied at the end even though it should have tightened theoretically.  however, april is being supported just off the strip.  getting word a lot of utilities are going in front of the puc trying to get approval for hedging programs this year. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/13/2001 11:07:13 AM

confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction? 
i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8. whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.  i think it's close to here.  but when we get to november and we have 2.8 and don;'t repeat the weather of this past winter and we have 2.5 bcf more supply and people realize that we have 2.3 bcf to withdraw before there are any problems...bombs away.

any reaction to this? slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/06/2001 01:16:41 PM 
(Recasts, adds details) WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. electricity demand will grow by about 2.3 percent in 2001, down from 3.6 percent growth last year due to the nation's slowing economy, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday. Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report. Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S. electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal. U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA said. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh forecast by the agency last month. For the entire winter heating season of October through March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent from the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was driven by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively. More electricity plants were expected to switch from natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the government report said. ""This trend is expected to continue through the first quarter 2001,"" the EIA said. ""Although the favorable price differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001, expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep

i loved them in that i thought they were going to go up...i think they still might 3 weeks ago  now short term very bullish  neutral medium term neutral   neutral longer term neutral   bearish 
What it's trading  what I think it's really worth apr oct   540    500 nov mar 547    375 cal 2  491    400 cal 3   460    325 Obviously most bearish the further out you go.  However, the game right now is not sell and hold...although it will be soon.  The game is where will it be tomorrow and next week and next month.  The market is structurally short term gas thanks to our friends from california.  where ca is buying power, williams and calpine and dynegy dont care of the gas costs 450 or 475 or 500 or 525.  irrelevant.  so term is not going down in the short term unless the front comes into the 400's and scares some producers to start hedging or we or el paso can find fixed price lng to the tune of 250,000 a day for 10 years. 
it just wasn't the same without you.   how was el doritos? 
theres only one thing i can think of...   storage field turning around gives cash market completely different feel.   instead of utilities looking to sell gas everday, they look to buy it.  huge difference in feel of mrket.  not so much actual gas but completely different economics of how marginal mmbtu gets priced.  tightening cash market causes cash players to buy futures... hence the tendency for a spring rally every year.  read heffner today...even he talks about it slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/06/2001 10:22:18 AM 
so let me ask you-if they dont buy flat px wfrom here with mega cold east weather, cash contangos,px only 25 cts from lows, after huge apr/oct buying-what would take us to much higher levels?? ie whats the risk of being short today? clueless and confused John.Arnold@enron.com on 03/06/2001 10:51:13 AM 
no real bias today  positive numbers sell negative numbers buy... looking into other stuff slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/06/2001 09:15:40 AM 
agreewith all, im mega bear summer 2nd q but for the time being weather and as u said uncertainy likely to lend itself so little downside until either weather gets warm or injections get big. i dont see the flow as you know but i talk to a cupla utitlities and the bias same as you menioned. ive neutralized bear book a bit cuz i cant afford to fite this thing. with deep pockets tho-i scale up sell next 2-3 weeks take a bet on 200 ish injections in april and 400 in may-ie records aug/oct-yes-low risk-wasnt substantially more inverted when we were 4 bucks higher-low risk but not a great reward. oct/nov-yea-wont make much for another few months on that so it range trades but ill cont to bersd it cuz if end summer that strong im always always more bullish the front of winter. other thing i wonder is how wide these summer contangos cud get-as everyone so bullish futs for the next few weeks at least. weather here sucks to day-tree almost fell on me driving into work-close one,sahud be about 2 ft of white stuff when its said and done. dunno how long i can stay but doesnt look all that great for me getting out to steamboat manana!! heres a hypothetical.... we agree that demand loss y on y somwhere from 4.5 to 5.0 today, do you guys think that we can see a substantial demand recovery if prices dont retreat? my ffeeling is no for at least another 90 days or more.thots? any thots on flat px today-im slitely long vs bearsds?

yes...please change griffith to trading. thanks, 
probably because jeff's out,, but let's go ahead and have it 
Yes, I'm around all week and, I don't know why the Tuesday meeting was cancelled. Gary 
So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level. With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying. Leads to more upside potential in short term. My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points. i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that

so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing... as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build the stack now to estimate. frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 100,000 last week as gas got to parity. let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts. bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really inactive. to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense. however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other. notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday? in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand. market needs to see some big stg numbers first. i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads. Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last year's early weather, bombs away. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/03/2001 07:03:14 AM 
this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient, weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in july-shud be marginal in apr-jun if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys like me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx where we are today all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some ammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha unction of an economic slowdown. anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your big fund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems quieter in the mkt lately. heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is on a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and be unable to inject all the gas available? thots also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct discount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it bt wondering if its transportation or storage cost related. have a good weekdn my man 
Are you around next Tuesday? 
I think you need to check your AGA model.  7.2 bcf/d seems awfully high. That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been 151.  Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week. 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81 4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ?? Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three weeks by 15 bcf. Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in current price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the market right now are to the upside in my view.  Course hard to imagine $6 for J.   Just sell vol. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/02/2001 10:54:14 AM 
my next aga number is 75-sllitely more than pira and assumes 7.2 bcf/d y on y s&d swing-the higher prices now the uglier it'll be later. contmaplating buying some 4.00 puts for lat 2nd q or early 3q for a few pennies. so whaen we go above last years stx in may!! beleive it or not pero been worse chop fest than gas-all i know is going to steamboat co skiing next wed-sunday with mans refined prod groups next week so taking postion down to the stuff i really like, dont have to worry too much about. John.Arnold@enron.com on 03/02/2001 11:44:50 AM 
i think this is the biggest chopfest in nat gas history.  scale up seller, scale down buyer. reviewing my aga model and assumptions later today.  i'll see if i have any new inspirations. slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/02/2001 10:25:45 AM 
he will be if we cut him off for a week i bet he gets some inspiration. have a good weekdn. any view here? i think short term range stuff-med-longer term you know what i think. sprds/front to backs range-bear em at -2 bull em at -5 till they go prompt.

freak show.   started at -7.  went to -15 then -7 then finishing out -15 slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/28/2001 08:32:27 AM 
john wud you mind terrbly telling me how hen hub and east etc cash mkts are this am as a delta to the screen? im working from home and my connection too slow to get  eol??? appreciate it alot-i bot some apr/jul (bulls sprd) for a short term play. 
industrial demand the scary thing.  no question there are some steel mills and auto factories and plastics plants that were on last november that arent coming up now and its not due to gas prices.  the economy sucks and it will affect ind demand. slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/28/2001 08:03:43 AM 
at least a myn dollars-need to talk to pira on that. excellant point. need to do some margin analyses . having said all that look at corporate earnings from last year to this year regardless of natgas costs as a feed industrials will be running slower and consumers just now feeling the pinch as rate increases have only just recently gotten approved and passed to the likes of us and people less fortunate than us. John.Arnold@enron.com on 02/27/2001 11:05:40 PM 
but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up a lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand will there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if you can answer that. slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/27/2001 08:12:32 PM 
off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day swing y on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their feet and recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes as current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is no-not unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q. remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started only 6 weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full swing. we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring a greenhouse in the ohio valley good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha John.Arnold@enron.com on 02/27/2001 08:23:22 PM 
Good to hear from you. After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest. i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2 bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching, full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now. Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go. slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/26/2001 04:48:06 PM 
its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of march/apr a cupla times, no disasters. well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a month ago to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas demand. now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side? i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but here you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day y on y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C demandd energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will effect utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan for this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power pxes rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in the summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than heat. i say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is another .7/1bcf/d loss. put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top of last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to 3.6 tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to restore demand??? thots. as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon and ill keep you posted.

How about drinks at 5:30 on Thursday.   I try not to interrupt work with personal business. ""Gapinski, Michael"" <michael.gapinski@painewebber.com> on 02/25/2001 03:13:29 PM 
Michael: Thanks for putting the paperwork together. I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen. John ""Michael Gapinski"" <michael.gapinski@painewebber.com> on 02/21/2001 08:23:04 AM 
Michael: Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium. I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look into that for me. John. ""Michael Gapinski"" <michael.gapinski@painewebber.com> on 02/20/2001 06:28:27 PM 
John - I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're interested.

does larry chaffe people at your shop as much as he does ours? 
I think so in a month or so.  Problem now is that there is so much customer buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market, with such a flat curve, is going nowhere.  That will change, but it's going to take a while.  I like it eventually. Bill White@ENRON 02/21/2001 05:39 AM 
Don't know about the front 2 months, but gut feel is that april thru oct at approximately 50% seems like something to own (although I hate flat vol curves).  What do you think (long, flat, or short)? John Arnold@ECT 14/02/2001 21:59 
Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you. One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die. I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders. John Andrew Fairley 02/20/2001 11:15 AM 
Thank you so much for your time last week. David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several issues helpful for our own market. This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from our side of the pond. Best regards Andy

Looks good except for settlement period.  Industry standard and for ease to Enron, a spread trade is treated as two separate trades.  Therefore, there will be two settlement periods for the respective legs of the transaction. The file below states settlement period is 5 days after both legs have been set.  Please change to 2 settlement periods, 5 days after each respective leg has been set. John Enron North America Corp. 
careful...i'm having another bad day 
We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will continue to be a subjective process.

it's one of those theoretically great trades, but those don't always work. Still, I'll put it on and win 7 times out of 10.  just so hard for the market to rally the backwardation is so weak. can easily see h going under if no weather appears. slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/12/2001 09:41:04 AM 
wish i had let you buy all of them-cash supriingly weak to me. so i bailed on the postion lost about 7 cts-not a disaster but a disappointment. flat px looks like a pig here depite my not being overly bearish the fundamentals. we hold or they take it down more??

ok- no wednesday night- ha ha could you do thursday?? 
the end of the season is typically the best month to hold. Even if the first part of the summer is weak, people will be hesistant to sell the back half. Same with the winter.  That's why I'm long H2.  It has good correlation with the front on up moves and tends to hold value on the down move.

John, Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all. The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the problem is. Brian Brian T.

Brian, We are not good to go here.  These are high profile traders and I do not want to install IE55 just for this chatting application.  I would like for Fangming to resolve whatever the problem is with IE5 first and go from there. Again, sorry to be a pain and I understand your situation, but developers should not develop applications with unsupported dependencies. -jkc Brian Hoskins@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/24/2000 03:44 PM 
John, So are we good to go to install IE 5.5?  From you email yesterday, I was under the impression that we were.  I understand that you guys need to keep the integrity of the system, but these guys really need this program ASAP. Again, if you need additional support, we can get that for you.  Just let me know what you need to resolve the problem. Thanks, Brian Brian T.

All, As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard application. Thanks, Fangming 
can you send it through lavo.  he's suppose to pay for it. thanks, john Liz M Taylor 02/09/2001 09:16 AM

imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you don't have  to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe. i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.   are you free saturday day and night?

hey hon: had a great time last night.  you're one ok chick. 
i think taking a cab is more convenient assuming we can find one on the way back. 
i think we would rally if march were the only thing traded.  Problem is summer and on out so weak.  trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 600.  some customer selling in cal 2.  so h/j and j/k need to blow out because no other spread is moving.  i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to blow.  all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly. it's a struggle each penny at this point.  at least one spread needs to break if we're going to run and i don't see that happening. slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/08/2001 11:20:40 AM 
i think we rally a little from here this pm-that said i dont think mar/may gonna movre up much unless we see cash start to improve.. any thots on east cash? its a pig-of course no loads. whats gonna be the driver for march/apr from here you think? 
cute girlfriends....    I'm in 
absolutely agree.  the thought is always, even if cash is piece of shit today...wait until the future.  here's my question: what is the environment whereby f/g is worth $.50.   is there a market scenario where this happens? slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/12/2000 03:22:07 PM 
if you havent read this yet youl think im brilliant-too bad i didnt short jan/feb or apr/may! Steve LaFontaine 12/12/2000 07:49 AM 
other question and reason i dont do anything with jan/feb is whats gona make the mkt bearish the feb? perception is stx get titire so inverses grow.. only thing i can think of is will they get concerned over this industrial slowdown going forward and weather going above-i struggle generally tho is weather was still so warm last year hard to get overly bearish rest of the winter from a y on y standpoint Steve LaFontaine 12/11/2000 09:18 PM 
wish i had a stronger view-my view combined with year end give me just strong enuf bias not to do anything. its nuts-but you pted out something a while back is this indistries abilty to keep a contango-we dont have that but they certainly doing their best. for cash to be at huge premiums and cold weather up front like we have nt had in years, 15 dollar ny, 50 socal, 10 buck hub-shit whats it take, not like theres huge spec lenght left. i guess to the extent mkt is sooo concerned about running out in march-they gonna keep a huge premium in whats left of the winter strip vs summer, and they shud. cash loan deals have to keep hedged lenght in mar there fore makes em strong so long as they stay way below ratchets. other thing worries me about jan is cash tite but will steadily get some relief from switching, proocessing margins negtive , dist, resid, nukes coming up, then on day we come in and they say weather going above normal 1 st 10 days of jan... BAM guess they wack it. and yes apr/may i think is nuts, mar/apr i dont in part cuz apr whud be a dog. i cant figure out how and when best way to short it/hedge my bet dont know-im leaving it alone, the cash makes it a jan/feb a compelling but too many ifs, yes and dec/jan expirey, wud have thot cash wud recverse the psychology. but not. im pretty lost john and the risks are bigger than i care to take till january-spending next cuplpa weeks formulating some long term strategies in both natgas and oil. and try not to gain anymore weight before the new year. 
The el orbits, eh? i've heard of them but don't remember who they are. there is a chance i've seen them at satellite i guess. my, you are nosey.  i have a little date tonight.  wanna come along? 
we need one more good shot of cool air to ensure complete and utter chaos for the next 10 months.  hopefully this is it. you gotta love heffner...'if we take out the jan 31 low there is NO WAY anything bullish can happen' slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/08/2001 05:28:02 AM 
thats what we wanna hear 
This morning's 6-10 day forecast models are showing somewhat better agreement.  All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great Lakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases, the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period. All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air. More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be available with the 6:30am ET release. -Matt Rogers
