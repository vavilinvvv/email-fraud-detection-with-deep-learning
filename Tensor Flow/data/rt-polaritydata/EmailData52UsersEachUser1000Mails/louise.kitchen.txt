The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year 
We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- +	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub +	Development		Jay Webb +	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster +	HR			David Oxley +	Cash Management	Tom Myers +	Credit			Debbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly. We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually. Customer Side +	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) +	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers Phase  2 Customers Phase  3 Customers +	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) +	Customer visit schedule Product Side +	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week Phase 2 - First Month Phase 3 - First Quarter Target Number of Transactions +	Phase 1 +	Phase 2 +	Phase 3 IT transfer

Thanks for the update. No point in pushing Andrew back though, that's the point of an audit. Louise 
I just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the PCG wish list. We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our list of development/enhancements to our applications.  We met on numerous occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc.  However, I think primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date. Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now.  I know Bob Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs. My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be re-auditing us before the end of the year.  The key control weakness of the PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the list of things to do.  I think we are fairly close, but we will need to start and complete testing over the next several weeks.   My hope is that we push Andrew back as far as possible! Please let me know if you have any questions - Sheri 
Philippe has now allocated your resource. Louise Thomas D Gros@ENRON 10/10/2000 07:57 
I hate to sound like a broken record, but our lack of IT support has now reached a critical point.  We need to begin work immediately on legacy system integration--basically modifying our existing systems (Unify, Sitara, Enpower,...) to generate first columnar and then (hopefully) XML data output.  This work is most appropriately done by the people who best know these systems, our IT group. The development of the three modules is proceeding well.  We have designed the architecture to allow limited-capability versions of all three by the end of this year.  The key critical path item remains legacy system integration. The key step towards integration is the appointment of a senior IT person on our team.  Please let me know what I can do to help in this regard. All the best, Tom 
The weekly MG report - we discussed 
Hi Guys Please see below for update from the Merlin Integration team. Regards Amita 
Everyone should be using Enron Net Works LLC in Sally's group from 1.1.2001. Thanks Nicki Daw@ENRON 01/22/2001 10:51 AM 
Louise, I don't think I have seen you this year - Happy New Year! I have been asked what company name should be put on the business cards of some of Sally Beck's group.  I have been telling most people to stick with they organisation names e.g. Enron North America or Enron South America, rather than Enron Americas/Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want everybody to use Enron Net Works, or should the trading support groups use their business unit names ENA, EGM, EIM? See you soon. Nicki P.S.  Mark gave me a voucher for Urban Retreat for Christmas, which I am very pleased with.  Sue's jealous, she got crystal! 
Do we have an integration problem we need to deal with. Also can we have an update of the commercialization of your group following your meeting. Louise

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year 
On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process. The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows: It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy. 9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen 9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell 10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port 11:00		Credit				Bradford 11:30		Back Office			Beck/Hall 12:30		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb 1pm		Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb 1:30pm		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub 2:00pm		HR				Oxley Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32. Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc. Assume Big Pig will bring 8 people. Thanks Louise 
Thanks for the update. No point in pushing Andrew back though, that's the point of an audit. Louise 
I just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the PCG wish list. We discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our list of development/enhancements to our applications.  We met on numerous occasions with Mark D. and team to prioritize, etc.  However, I think primarily due to the reorg in IT, and Mark leaving the team, we have done a lot of talking over the past three weeks, but nothing has happened to date. Jennifer and I met with Hal Elrod yesterday, and I have met with Bob Hillier a couple of times, and we seem to be on the right track now.  I know Bob Hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs. My concern is growing due to the fact that Andrew Parsons and team will be re-auditing us before the end of the year.  The key control weakness of the PCG was the lack of Profiles Manger - I have stressed that this is #1 on the list of things to do.  I think we are fairly close, but we will need to start and complete testing over the next several weeks.   My hope is that we push Andrew back as far as possible! Please let me know if you have any questions - Sheri 
Doesn't really count for your group I just include you on all  of those types of messages - we have a lot of new people who have never worked the system before. I agree on the all or nothing - let's talk this afternoon. Its typical Enron execution I'm afraid - this is our HR departments we are talking about! Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
I am asking Tammie to compile a Weekly Report (for delivery 8am Monday mornings) which is formatted as below.  Please make sure starting next week the information if received in adequate time. Deals Signed LOI Signed NDAs signed Earnings Report (from Kerry) Individual Group general update (to include deals working plus other info) Thanks 
Do we have an integration problem we need to deal with. Also can we have an update of the commercialization of your group following your meeting. Louise 
Everyone should be using Enron Net Works LLC in Sally's group from 1.1.2001. Thanks Nicki Daw@ENRON 01/22/2001 10:51 AM 
Louise, I don't think I have seen you this year - Happy New Year! I have been asked what company name should be put on the business cards of some of Sally Beck's group.  I have been telling most people to stick with they organisation names e.g. Enron North America or Enron South America, rather than Enron Americas/Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want everybody to use Enron Net Works, or should the trading support groups use their business unit names ENA, EGM, EIM? See you soon. Nicki P.S.  Mark gave me a voucher for Urban Retreat for Christmas, which I am very pleased with.  Sue's jealous, she got crystal!

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would include spreadsheets etc. Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today. To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement. For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists. Thanks

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- +	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub +	Development		Jay Webb +	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster +	HR			David Oxley +	Cash Management	Tom Myers +	Credit			Debbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly. We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually. Customer Side +	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) +	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers Phase  2 Customers Phase  3 Customers +	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) +	Customer visit schedule Product Side +	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week Phase 2 - First Month Phase 3 - First Quarter Target Number of Transactions +	Phase 1 +	Phase 2 +	Phase 3 IT transfer 
The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year 
We have spoken about this before, the issue is that Enron Americas has no approval mechanism for contracts. Neither does any other group but that is not my problem.  I have spent too much time reading DASH forms which really do not provide full authorization. There are two suggestions that I would like to be implemented: (i) DASH forms need to include all of the contracts which are to be signed under the deal.  So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the contracts to be signed in the deal.  Any contracts which are not included need to go through the process outlined below. (ii) All contracts need a Contract Approval Form attached and Enron's legal team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed (ie signed) by the following Enron staff. Trader/Originator ________________________________ Head of Group (VP or above)______________________ Credit__________________________________________ Legal__________________________________________ Tech Services (where applicable)__________________ Commercial Support (where applicable)_____________ A database of all completed contracts on behalf of Enron Americas needs to be maintained by Legal. 
Voicemail on where we are with the CFE is being forwarded to you for 
Prepared in contemplation of litigation -  Attorney Client Privilege There appears to be no succinct way to write down my thoughts on where we are with El Paso but I'm going to try. Assumption: Kilgore's objective:  Maintain PRM accounting treatment for the swap. Outcome of lawsuit:   Game Over for Kilgore if his accountants disagree with the current PRM treatment and move it to debt thus affecting his      ratios and revolver. What do we want? (i)  To be certain of payment - how important is this really?  Pretty important - but what is this worth is cash terms.  We clearly are in a position   whereby if El Paso evers transfers the contract to an entity which defaults on payment we are exposed.  However,  realistically what are the chances  of them defaulting - very low and, would we win that in court - Yes. (ii)  To monetize the contract - secondary concern with a value to Enron of $15m.  There are potential ways that we could monetize the contracts without disclosing the contract - Joe is working on these.    If there is a way we can do this then our downside from this confidentiality issue is much   smaller as it would cost us more to monetize (thereby bringing in less gain - probably not much of a difference) but can we get the asset off the book?  We are pursuing how far we can get  in terms of 'true sale' treatment with V&E - they will give Joe a view on Wednesday.  There are potential other   ways we can ensure this is off our credit. If we sue them?  Loss of leverage. We potentially open up the issue to a much wider audience and potentially affect Kilgore's accounting treatment - the one thing he wants.  So our leverage has disappeared as we are no longer able to maintain the one thing Kilgore is looking for. Way Forward: We should continue to pursue a commercial solution to the payment issue and monetize the contract through a secondary route.  If we complete monetization through another route then we are exposed to non-payment which could be perceived as very low risk (we have potentially a one year exposure on the back end based on six years statute of limitations).  If we cannot get a way forward on the monetization , then re-review the way forward. We are at risk of them suing us over the confidentiality breach and that would be in New York. Good Luck!

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are: Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power Lloyd Will for East Power Geof Storey for Gas Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada. Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal. Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working. I am assuming its zero at the moment. Thanks 
OK thanks.  I'll presume its dead until I hear otherwise. --------------------------

Tana, We met with Scott  Clark the Assistant Managing Editor of the Houston Chronicle this week and discussed the possibility of putting some EnronOnline pricing in the Houston Chronicle.

PWC - whose NDA is it? Please exapnd to all VPs. 
Rex Shelby or David Berberian to sign 
Don't bother - just let someone else sign - they are EBS ex employees. Wait for them to request 
I had an odd request come in today for Robert to become an officer of EnronOnline LLC.  EnronOnline LLC should not be used for anything (eg we get employed by Net Works LLC) -  I don't understand why are we using EnronOnline LLC for HR purposes.  I have rejected the request until you get back to me as I am concerned we are using it when we should not. Thanks 
Thanks - only Net Works will have them. Michelle Cash 11/14/2000 11:41 PM 
Louise, I was under the misimpression that EnronOnline LLC would have employees, and, as such, that Robert would need to be an officer.   Since that is not the case, there is no such need.  Sorry for the confusion! Thanks. Michelle Louise Kitchen 11/14/2000 01:17 PM

Absolutely - I can't find the previous email but it may have been lost during the few days they moved my email box from London to Houston - I know I had a lot of lost emails - do you have his phone number and email and we can sort out a password for a few days for him too.

Louise, Some time ago I sent you a message regarding Ed Krapels. He is writing a book on energy commodity markets and would like to learn more about EOL. Can you give him a  call and chat with him for 10 minutes. He is a good friend of Enron and it would be free ad for us. Vince 
Congratulations to you too. Happy New Year too. Vince J Kaminski 01/11/2000 03:54 PM 
Louise, Congratulations. Well deserved. Vince 
Thanks  - we are going to set up interviews.  We are making progress on the Course (although they do not offer any online piece - is that your understanding?). Louise Vince J Kaminski 12/05/2000 01:26 PM 
Louise, I am sending you a resume I received today. She graduated from the same university in Poland I attended (many moons earlier). She recently got an additional degree in e-commerce. Vince 
Please could you sort out an guest id for one month. 
Louise, Can we grant him guest access to EOL again? He is he same person who requested it a few weeks ago. Evidently he was busy working on another project. Vince 
Dear Vince, I hope your trip to Australia was successful. It's one of my favorite places to go. I've copied you on the email to Mike initiating Enron's trial service to Energycast. Thanks for helping to set this up. Would you ask the authorities in Enron to refresh my access to Enrononline? My Guest User ID as ENA61296 and my guest password was TR84BY13. They no longer work, probably because I haven't visited the site in months as we were in full development mode on Energycast. Vince, you will note in our website references to forward prices of power in Nepool, NYPP, and PJM. We use Reuters as a reference -- not satisfactory. If your traders like Energycast and Enron became a client, would Enron consider linking its prices to our site? We have to improve over the Reuters quotes and regard Enrononline or Bloomberg as the best candidates. Over time, as our service spreads I believe this could help generate deal flow for your traders. Let me know what you think. Ed 
Just thought you'd like to know we are not having a grat deal of success with contacting ED - let us know if there is anything else I can do? 
Jim Please confirm it is ok for Vince to release source code to Jay Webb (Enron). Thanks

Louise - First, congratulations on your resent position change. Sounds like an exciting and challenging opportunity for you. Second, you may have already heard but I just wanted to touch base with you and give you an update on WaterDesk. American Water Works on Friday notified us that they have decided to pass on the acquisition of WaterDesk. This is unfortunate for both the industry and WaterDesk as a whole. We are immediately positioning WD to sell the individual assets as feasible and have severed the team effective 3/16/01. Thank you for providing the names of your Directors within Networks, the team has been in contact with the various names you provided us. Alex and myself will be remaining to work with various systems integrators and any other potential purchasers interested in the ""parts"" of WaterDesk during the next several weeks. And finally on a personal note, I was incredibly impressed with you and the way you carried yourself during our meeting last month.  It was refreshing to speak to someone as high energetic as you and to talk to someone who really ""get's it"" at Enron. I'd be interested if you had any opportunities and/or suggestions for an individual such as myself given my background in developing and executing new business strategies for clients in the consulting arena and most recently leading the WaterDesk from a product to a services focused company. I look forward to any suggestions you may have. Regards, Karen Welsch.

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. Transportation The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. Video You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet). Please find attached the following information: (i) Attendees and Teams for Video (ii) Draft Agenda Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek.

=20 =20 FEATURES: INFORMATION SERVICES=20 Physical benchmarksin an on-line world Startup on-line commodity exchanges = seem not to realize that there are several good reasons why benchmarks deri= ved from volumetric indices may not work--and may not be useful--for physic= al products, such as oil and petrochemicals. But there are other routes to = price discovery=20 By Neil Fleming=20 Apr. 1, 2001=20 Global Energy Business=20 Page 37=20 Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.=20 Somewhere near 500 Internet-based exchanges for energy, oil, petrochemicals= , and hydrocarbon shipping have been launched worldwide over the past two y= ears. But most have since folded or been acquired. It's interesting to note= that virtually all of those exchanges--both the survivors and the deceased= --have two things in common. -- They were created from scratch by entrepren= eurs from the technology world, or from the industries their exchanges are = (or were) intended to serve. -- The businessmen and women behind them have = followed the same train of thought in concluding that on-line trading was a= business they could succeed at.=20 This train of thought can be broken down into four parts. Premise 1: On-line trading is ``more efficient'' and will save its particip= ants money. Premise 2: I can capture some of those savings as site revenue. Premise 3: My site will be the best site out there, so everyone will use it= . Premise 4: With all this liquidity, I can construct benchmarks. My benchmar= ks will be unimpeachably scientific and replace the existing, unscientific = benchmarks currently used by the industry. As a result, I will make even mo= re money, because I will become an information provider. This article will examine those premises and the limits of their inherent l= ogic, with a view to showing why very few--if any--of the 500 launched exch= anges will survive. In particular, it will show why the logic of Premise 4 = is not valid for markets in physical commodities, such as oil and petrochem= icals. Premise 1: On-line trading is more efficient Few would question that, in theory, electronic trading has the potential to= make liquid markets much more efficient. The history of EnronOnline, proba= bly the most successful electronic energy trading system in the world today= , supports that view. According to Enron, EnronOnline has succeeded in rais= ing the number of transactions completed by each of its market makers from = an average 672 in 1999 to 3,084 last year, while lowering the marginal cost= per transaction by 75% over the two-year period. However, the markets that EnronOnline predominantly serves are two of the m= ost liquid and homogeneous in the energy business: natural gas and electric= ity. Moreover, the exchange has achieved its efficiency gains using a model= very different from any deployed by--or available to--most on-line exchang= es. Essentially, Enron has used on-line trading to extend and complement it= s existing, off-line trading business. Enron's focus remains the transactio= n, rather than the transaction system. By contrast, the majority of transaction platforms for physical commodities= are interlopers. Their operators assume that commodities traders are willi= ng to depersonalize their business by having their complex transactions exe= cuted not by humans, but by an electronic system that can do deals faster a= nd more anonymously, and--at least in theory--with more players. This assumption is a risky one, largely because it is based on a buyer's pe= rception of how marketplaces should operate. It fails to take into account = the concerns of physical commodity sellers and--more importantly--producers= . Typically, producers wish to ensure that the uptake of their commodity is= continuous, because that minimizes the volatility of the commodity's price= . Relationships become all-important under such conditions--but relationshi= ps are hardly enhanced by electronic dealing. To quote the November/Decembe= r 2000 issue of the Harvard Business Review, ``Few suppliers want to be ano= nymous contestants in ruthless bidding wars.'' Premise 2: I can make money selling gains in efficiency The logic underlying Premise 2 is potentially seriously flawed. For while t= here is no doubt that market participants are prepared to pay for more effi= cient services, such as electronic trading, the nature of the forces drivin= g physical energy commodity markets casts doubt on whether a trading system= can, in the long term, make a profit by charging per-transaction fees. Here's why: Although the era of competition is just beginning, it's clear t= hat pressure on transaction fees is already downward, and will remain in th= at direction even if the number of participants in an exchange shrinks to a= handful. In the energy business, the potential for efficiency gains--as a = percentage of total industry cost--simply is not that great. For example, r= esearch done for Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, New York,= indicates that the total potential efficiency ``pool'' in the oil industry= is only $150 million/year. Even if only 10 businesses were to try to carve= a profitable enterprise out of such a pool, each would be hard-pressed to = do so. What's more, such businesses would have an even harder time turning a profi= t because some of their competitors wouldn't be using a per-trade revenue m= odel. In particular, sites operated by market participants, such as EnronOn= line, will tend to charge nothing per trade, because their business models = seek to profit not from commissions on transactions, but rather from the tr= ansactions themselves. By implication, it seems likely that an exchange wil= l be able to make money only if its owners sell something else: clearing fa= cilities, back-office integration, or information to decision-makers. Premise 3: My site will be the best, so it will capture all the market liqu= idity available This statement--which essentially says that given enough marketing support,= a site can change the trading patterns of an industry to capture all of it= s liquidity--is a fallacy. The logical problem with the premise is clear. Because no one has yet devel= oped a trading software package that is clearly superior to others, what ``= best site'' really means is ``most liquid site.'' So the pre-condition for = capturing ``all'' the liquidity is that the site must already be the most l= iquid site. Some startup exchanges have attempted to solve this problem by insisting th= at their participants make volume guarantees. But volume guarantees conflic= t directly with traders' focus on profits. Trading businesses that tell the= ir traders to sacrifice profits for the sake of the common good are playing= a risky game; if the common good means lower trading profits, the traders = will simply leave for greener pastures. To become the ``best'' site, then, a site must somehow find a way to bootst= rap its liquidity, perhaps by offering substantial, non-volume-related ince= ntives or efficiencies to users. However, the paradox is that most sites' revenue models depend almost exclu= sively on volume. Premise 4: Once I capture lots of liquidity, I can build benchmarks This premise is the most startling and--in some ways--the most flawed of th= e four. It raises many serious questions, the answers to any of which can i= nvalidate the model. Worse, these questions are all highly theoretical, mak= ing persuasive answers even harder to come by. Among the questions are: -- How much liquidity is enough? -- Do indexes (vo= lumetric averages) make good physical benchmarks? -- Can a trading site ben= chmark with the bid/offer range? -- Can a trading site generate a close? An= d, last but not least: What is a benchmark, anyway? Benchmarks and indices A benchmark is a price or series of prices that a market's participants agr= ee to use as the basis for determining other prices. Useful benchmarks are = good indicators of transactable value. A benchmark allows market participan= ts to determine at what price they should buy or sell the commodity. Benchmarks are typically used in complex markets with multi-dimensional var= iables for arbitrage. In oil, for example, benchmark pricing has grown up a= round the need to compute relative values for differing commodities across = time, geographical distance, commodity type, and the degree to which one co= mmodity may be substituted for another. It is a common error, however, to believe that markets should or do use the= ir most liquidly traded commodities as benchmarks. Although liquidity is a = major asset of benchmarks, many markets use illiquid benchmarks whose other= characteristics outweigh the liquidity advantage. These include market tra= nsparency; the free and open availability of the commodity; the absence of = political or partisan control of the commodity; the absence of delivery res= trictions on it; and the size of the end-user market where the commodity wi= ll be consumed. For example, although the physical volume of Dubai crude oi= l actually produced is tiny, it nonetheless is used as a key benchmark for = all of Asia because--unlike its Persian Gulf competitors--it is the only cr= ude oil that has these characteristics. One way to compute a commodity's benchmark price is through strict indexati= on, the process of constructing a price marker from a volumetric average of= concluded business. However, this process will have little chance of produ= cing a useful benchmark unless the contributing volumes are high. If it doe= sn't reflect a sufficient number of trades, an index has little or no stati= stical validity as an indication of transactable price. This represents a problem for benchmarking oil prices, whether for crude or= products. Of the 77 million barrels of crude produced worldwide each day, = the vast majority are sold on the long-term contract market, leaving perhap= s as little as 10% to be traded ``spot.'' In reality, this figure is booste= d in multiple ways, primarily by transaction chaining--the repeated on-sell= ing of cargos--but, even assuming threefold transaction growth as a result = of electronic trading, is still perilously low to be used as a valid basis = for strict indexation, especially considering the great diversity of crude = oil specifications around the world. For many crude oils, the trading basis= for establishing price can be just a few transactions per month. Even for = ``liquid'' benchmark crudes, the basis is typically just a handful of trade= s per day. Oil markets, however, don't seem to care. For example, the settl= ement basis for the International Petroleum Exchange's Brent crude oil futu= res contract is an index based on a smattering of physical trades taking place on the day of expiry. Acceptance of an indexa= tion mechanism such as this has difficult prerequisites. These include open= participation in the mechanism, the perceived existence of a ``level playi= ng field,'' the existence of comparative historical data, and achieving ``b= uy in'' from the market's dominant players. The nature of today's on-line exchanges makes these conditions hard to meet= . Not everyone uses exchanges; they may be owned by industry players; they = typically have little or no historical data; their daily volume fluctuates = wildly; and major players' commitment to them is either fragmentary or comp= romised by volume commitments. In today's environment, the chance that an i= ndex will be able to gain market acceptance as a benchmark is extremely sli= m. Are strict volumetric indices useful? Another big question surrounding volu= metric indices is how useful they are as benchmarks for physical commoditie= s. Advocates of indexation argue that its statistical methodology helps eli= minate market distortions caused, for example, by market closes. In additio= n, they argue that the alternative approach--``market assessment,'' based o= n human judgements about transactable prices--is too subjective to be relie= d on to determine benchmark prices. Indexation, its proponents argue, ``eli= minates'' this subjectivity. In practice, however, this argument doesn't pass the ``so what?'' test. Eve= n if a system such as indexation succeeds in taking judgement out of the de= termination of market prices, it cannot prevent attempts to distort the ind= ex by exploiting the ``rules'' on which the system is based. In many markets, human judgement is the only effective defense against mark= et plays whose goal is profit, not price transparency. Even in highly liqui= d markets--such as, for example, the monthly natural gas market in the U.S.= --the indices generated by information companies like Platts are subject to= human review and analysis. During their generation, Platts' market special= ists undertake a string of comparative tests to unearth potential distortio= ns in reported prices. Whenever such distortions become apparent, Platts' e= ditors investigate the market further and, where necessary, eliminate certa= in trades from the assessment picture. There are good reasons for their dil= igence. A volumetric index can be manipulated by volume plays, by a few pla= yers under the cloak of ``anonymous dealing,'' by selective trading, or by = hedging in one marketplace and trading in another. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how players with exposure to a particular price = on the buy side might--and actually do--manipulate a volumetric index. By d= oing lots of business early in the day when the market is rising, they can = skew the volumetric average for the day lower (Figure 1). When the market i= s falling, they reverse the pattern and shift their transactions to late in= the day, again pushing the market down (Figure 2). When players do this co= nsistently, the impact on an index can be considerable over time. There are other, potentially more serious problems with indices. Because an= index is a theoretical construct, in a rapidly moving market it will manif= est lag--and become useless to market participants seeking the answer to th= e question, ``At what price should I buy or sell?'' Indeed, an index may ev= en actively mislead people asking this question. For example, in a fast ris= ing market, an index generated over the course of one day will be significa= ntly below the opening market price on the following day. This creates the = impression that prices have somehow moved overnight, whereas in fact they m= ay not have moved at all. But perhaps the biggest problem with indices relates to their use in heavil= y interlinked markets, where prices are constrained by a complex of spread = and arbitrage values. This description applies to most energy markets, and = is particularly apt for today's global, physical market for oil. In markets= where spread relationships are as or more important than outright prices, = the process of generating averaged indices tends to generate sets of prices= that cannot be reconciled with each other. Figure 3 depicts a dramatized version of this problem. Price 1 and Price 2 = are interdependent; here, there is always a 5 cents difference between them= . However, the volume pattern for the day's trade (shown in the lower part = of the figure) is such that while Price 1 has very high volume early in the= day, Price 2 does not enjoy its volume boost until later. The result: Cont= rary to market reality, the volumetric averages for Price 1 and Price 2 say= that they only differ by 1 cents. Other routes to price discovery So, if an on-line trading system cannot generate a reliable benchmark from = an index, are there other routes to price discovery? Yes, two. The first is= to benchmark from a bid-offer range, and the second is to use a close of s= ome kind. Bid-offer ranges are widely used as market measurement tools by Platts and = others. However, the automated application of bid-offer ranges in pursuit o= f ``scientific'' benchmarks is fraught with difficulty. What happens when t= here is a bid, but no offer? An offer, but no bid? What rules can be writte= n to discriminate between an ``off-market'' bid and an ``on-market'' one? H= ow should a system decide when a bid or offer's timing is not representativ= e of the typical market? Most on-line exchanges have not even begun to answ= er these questions, and at best offer their users a ``last bid-last offer''= price range that can accidentally distort their perception of the market, = if the two are not aligned in time, or if it turns out, for example, that t= he ``last bid'' was actually withdrawn in response to the ``last offer.'' Some exchanges, implicitly acknowledging that creating useful benchmarks is= difficult, have tried to incorporate their transactions and bid/offers int= o published benchmarks. Obviously, they hope that their system will attract= more liquidity if it is tied to a traditional benchmark. But it's safe to = say that a publisher will be interested in incorporating an exchange's prop= rietary markers only if transaction bid/offers are open and transparent. Can an on-line site benchmark from a close? In theory, yes. But if human ha= nds and brains intervene, the process is no longer a mechanical one, but ra= ther an editorial/judgement effort. Here too, there are many obstacles. One= of the biggest is that closing prices work best in two kinds of markets: c= ompletely ``open'' markets, in which assessments are derived by surveying a= ll participants; and ``sole-operator'' markets--like futures markets--where= the traded instrument exists only on that exchange. Physical commodities, by contrast, are traded across a broad spectrum of in= struments and sub-markets. It would be virtually impossible for the owner o= f a single sub-market--or on-line exchange--to assert the superiority of it= s close over someone else's, or to build market acceptance for a price deri= ved from a trading pool that doesn't include all players. Even a system used by most players--for example, the oil industry's derivat= ives-trading Intercontinental Exchange--would have a hard time convincing a= nyone to rely exclusively on its closing prices. That's not only because ``= most'' is not the same as ``all,'' but also because liquidity is frequently= too low to assure that there will in fact be a traded market to close ever= y day. What happens to the benchmark on days when no one comes out to play? In conclusion, it appears that price discovery may not necessarily be an em= ergent property of on-line trading systems. That may be the case because th= e creators of most on-line trading systems have confused its mechanism with= its function. Trading systems are neither new markets nor new marketplaces= ; they are simply new vehicles for participating in existing marketplaces. = A telephone is also a vehicle for participating in markets--but no one expe= cts their phone to be able to tell them the price of a commodity.=20 GEB0111600001 =20 Related Topics:    =20 =20 Dow Jones Topics=20 Publication: Global Energy Business=20 =20 News:=20 ENGL=20 =20 =20 Copyright ? 2001 Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive LLC.

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. Transportation The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. Video You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).

Is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the Mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee.  I know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $10mm to cancel the contracts?  If we could do we want to do this? How much money would we lose (how much of a write down would we take) if I told you I wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of September? As an aside, the Mitsubishis will be leaving the Enron Americas Balance Sheet now and moving to EGAS.  This does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward.  For the company overall, we need to move these turbines (as with all the others) as soon as possible and we (in the Americas) are in a much better position than EGAS is to move them.  I have spoken to Jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward. Louise 
finally read it - I thought it was pretty crappy. 
Following this morning's meeting, we have agreed to have a fifteen minute conference call on a Thursday morning to give a quick update of issues.  Chris Calger will ensure a list of progress is circulated prior to the two calls.

Enron Management Committee 
Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford. As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'. UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into. Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties. This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect: 1.	Transitional Steering Committee: This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002. Committee Members: Mike Hutchins (co-chair) Greg Whalley (co-chair) Louise Kitchen Pat O'Donnell Mike Bolin Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002. Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only. Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST 2.	Integration Committee: This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee. Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Pat O'Donnell (co-chair) Mark Bridges Sally Beck  - Operations Mark Haedicke - Legal Wes Colwell - Financial Operations Bill Bradford - Credit David Port - Market Risk Jay Webb - IT Jenny Rub - Infrastructure Peter Keohane - Canada David Forster - ubswenergy.com UBS counterparties Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002. Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate. Time - Thursday 9:00am CST 3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee: This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses. Proposed Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Greg Whalley (co-chair) Tim Belden Chris Calger John Lavorato Kevin Presto Hunter Shively Rob Milnthorp Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required. ?Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002. Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee. 3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date. Proposed Sub-Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Pat O'Donnell (co-chair) Mike Bridges Sally Beck  - Operations Mark Haedicke - Legal Wes Colwell - Financial Operations Bill Bradford - Credit David Port - Market Risk Jay Webb - IT Jenny Rub - Infrastructure Peter Keohane - Canada David Forster - ubswenergy.com Proposed Logistics: This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded. Time Tuesday 8:00am CST 3(ii)	Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the UBS Warburg Energy Counterparties are capable of transacting with our new company in the shortest time possible and in the most efficient way for both the counterparty and UBS Warburg Energy. Proposed Sub-Committee Members: Louise Kitchen Bryan Murtaugh - UBS Legal Mark Taylor Elizabeth Sager/Leslie Hansen Mary Cook/Jeff Hodge Bill Glass Bill Bradford Peter Keohane Barry Tycholiz Frank Vickers Laura Luce Rob Milnthorp Chris Calger David Forster Other members to be announced Proposed Logistics: This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded.

This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year. A great reflection on you guys too. Louise Ref: Houston Chronicle website * * * * * Tuesday, Dec. 4 I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. * * * * *  ""Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too.""  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me. Matt Hommel, Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 
I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now. Can we discuss?

Firstly,  I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.  Sorry. Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each. It works - we have enough people to do it. In terms of the Estate: The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate. In terms of NewCo: EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.

This amused me this morning! Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, ""If I can

Current costs.  In these plans we have expensed software and hardware which we will probably amortize.  Gets us around the $200mm mark.

I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today.  I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.

Just to clear up a mis-understsanding. Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality. In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before. Thanks 
Apart from the practicalities - Only Enron Canada and Enron Australia have the right to trade in the North American markets.  Australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement - so we assume that's dead.  ECC is in the deal and selling its rights.   So as far as the exclusive for North America Gas and Power we are OK.

Issue keeps coming up - Disaster Recovery 
Pat For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side. Hope this helps.

The following people have been identified as no longer with the company although they are on the Netco list.  Please let Kari know on any changes (Jeanie is out).  I assume there are no problems but if so let me know. Larry Hunter	- Documentation Deidre McCaffrey - Gas Origination Larry Cash - Gas Settlements Jon Lewis - Risk 
Shawn We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future. Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate) Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer) January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi. Thanks

Yes still need it -when are you back? -------------------------- 
Where's Jeanie? -------------------------- 
Can you ask Wes to bring the proforma too (15 copies) -------------------------- 
The meeting is to try and get portland back in line on timings - we clearly should not be in a position to trade physically immediately but within a month.  I am scared by his approach of 120 days for interconnection and 60 for FERC. -------------------------- 
Please ask wes to come over for 9:30 or earlier -------------------------- 
That may be the same for BR -------------------------- 
Good point - assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want. Obviously we shouldn't bother with bridgeline, peoples or anything like that. Will that work? -------------------------- 
I can't get attachments - please send teXt copy --------------------------

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year 
On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process. The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows: It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy. 9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen 9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell 10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port 11:00		Credit				Bradford 11:30		Back Office			Beck/Hall 12:30		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb 1pm		Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb 1:30pm		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub 2:00pm		HR				Oxley Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32. Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc. Assume Big Pig will bring 8 people. Thanks Louise 
Any interest in chatting about a job at UBS? -------------------------- 
Just when you thought it was safe............................ We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today. All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece). As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back. Thanks 
Redmond 175:175 -------------------------- 
We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- +	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub +	Development		Jay Webb +	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster +	HR			David Oxley +	Cash Management	Tom Myers +	Credit			Debbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly. We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually. Customer Side +	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) +	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers Phase  2 Customers Phase  3 Customers +	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) +	Customer visit schedule Product Side +	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week Phase 2 - First Month Phase 3 - First Quarter Target Number of Transactions +	Phase 1 +	Phase 2 +	Phase 3 IT transfer 
Any news from Redmond? -------------------------- 
So I never got paid (expenses) for my tickets home.  Surprize!!!!!  So if I cancel - obviously as I didn't go.  Can I then reclaim the economy ones I booked for my parents and brother instead as I did not take my 2001 entitlement.  The tickets were all economy (4 x $1374:74).  A lot cheaper still than three business seats. Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 
As I never used them - when do they get refunded - we then need to net off on expenses and reclaim the family ones. Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 
I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem. I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year. This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account. Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows: 11/13/01	4,069:72 11/10/01	21,010:15 11/10/01	3,319:40 Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000. In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000. In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name. 
Let's discuss Thanks

I have already registered several domaine names in the interest of getting up and running as soon as possible post sale of the business.  I have experience of delays as we have tried to retrieve domaine names where people have squatted intentionally in order to extract large sums of cash.  Should any of the buyers raise any issues - I do intend to use these for the purposes of our new business. I have a lot of them - spurious and real. 
Tammie They know you are picking up the tickets - you will need a photo id too. You need to be in your seats 30 minutes before the show - get a cocktail to take in - I recommend the 'O'.  You probably should pick up your tickets at an earlier time than the show as the queues are horrible  just before showtime. Louise Thank you for purchasing your tickets through the Bellagio Web site. This message confirms your purchase, as follows: Performance: ""O"" BY CIRQUE DU SOLEIL-MON Venue: ""O"" THEATRE AT BELLAGIO

Canada appears to be an issue. We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue. There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers. Please let me know how we can progress on this. 
How's it going?

We recognize that we are experiencing a difficult time at Enron now and you are all interfacing with our customers every day.  We are therefore holding a  short meeting at 9:00am tomorrow morning to answer questions from you and your groups. Tammie to advise on the room.  Please invite all of your groups. 
Here's what I have so far (who are we supposed to tell about this??) (i)	Broker Margins Approx:	 $50mm Availability:	 End of Week Probability:	 85% Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books. (ii)	Peoples JV Approx:	$135mm Availability:	Within month Probability:	50% We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay. (iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power). Approx:	$25.5mm Availability:	Dependent on whether financing Probability:	50% If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week. (iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank) Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off. 
Does this still have capacity?  Can I put the West Desk's ERCs in this vehicle? How quickly?  How much capacity is left? 
Forward to Tim Detmering Tim, How much money does Mariner have in the bank? Please drop John and I an email. Louise -------------------------- 
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together. I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999. Louise --------------------------

Here's a little issue. We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent? Thanks 
Expenditure verification 
Did you hear about  Jonathan? 
Please could you do the following; Cancel today 3pm	Barry Tycholiz 4pm	Weekly power meeting Tomorrow 3pm	Lagrasta 4pm 	Frank Vickers Friday 10am  	Brian Redmond 4pm	Brad Richter Thanks 
If you have an issue you need to ring Eric Gonzales. 
I went up to Chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office.  We obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ENA Houston (as the new building has new ones), they are going to redeploy them to you guys - Free (as we have already paid for them).  They are going to start with Calgary and Toronto.

Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both; (i) Correct, and (ii) Correctly allocated Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are: Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power Lloyd Will for East Power Geof Storey for Gas Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada. Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal. Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working. I am assuming its zero at the moment. Thanks

We are pushing back heavily on several budgets and instead of cutting costs, they are just planning to hold more of the allocation up at Corp.  Some areas are better than others but essentially, the overview is moving the wrong way (UP!).  We have no jurisdication over the Corp numbers. As an aside, the technology budget is up dramatically from last year, the numbers coming from IT are huge ($735mm this year (excluding Europe) versus $600mm last year for the whole of Enron Corp).  We are all over this one but progress is slow. If you want more details - let us know. 
I'm planning to go see Greg with Wes for 10 minutes on Friday to let him know how far we have got with the budgets.

Based on Dave's planning process for next year, the attached organisation chart highlights the areas where cuts can be made. The yellow people can leave, the person in red is still under discussion. 
9.MINORITY INTERESTS Enron consolidates a limited partnership (the Limited Partnership), for = which the consolidated third party's ownership interest is reflected in min= ority interests on Enron's balance sheet in the amount of $691 million at S= eptember 30, 2001.  The Limited Partnership assets include a $690 million n= ote payable from Enron and certain merchant investments, both domestic and = international.  Enron anticipates the receipt of $250 million from the sale= of one of the Limited Partnership's investments, a local gas distribution = company in Brazil, upon the closing of the sale which is pending certain re= gulatory and other approvals.  Enron may be required to use the net proceed= s upon the closing of the sale, or a portion thereof, to repay a portion of= the note payable. =20 The November 12, 2001 downgrade in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating = to BBB- by Standard & Poor's has caused a ratings event related to the Limi= ted Partnership.  This ratings event started a nine business day period dur= ing which Enron has the right, until November 26, 2001, to either post an u= nsecured letter of credit equal to Enron's note payable, repay the note pay= able with the Limited Partnership investing such proceeds in permitted inve= stments, or to purchase the investors' interest in the Limited Partnership.= To the extent that Enron does not satisfy this requirement by November 26= , 2001, the investors have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the = Limited Partnership assets.  Additionally, as a result of the rating downgr= ade, the investors, subject to certain actions, are able to accelerate and = assign the note payable.  Consistent with the restructuring plan discussed = in Note 2, Enron is currently working with the lenders to develop a mutuall= y acceptable amendment or waiver to the transaction documents in order to a= void an early Enron payment obligation. =20 Either as a result of the restructuring plan discussed in Note 2 or to r= aise cash to repay Enron's obligation discussed above, Enron may sell the L= imited Partnership assets for amounts below their carrying values.  The net= proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay Enron's obligat= ion.  Accordingly, Enron may be required to record asset writedowns, possib= ly as early as the fourth quarter of 2001.

In the event that Enron fails to pay a= ny debt obligations when due, including when such obligations may be accele= rated, or is unable to refinance or obtain a waiver of its obligation, a se= ries of events would begin which could impact Enron's compliance with the t= erms of its Revolving Credit Agreements and certain other obligations, incl= uding bank debt facilities. =20 Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 
Not good. Tracey Ngo was excellent. 
Energy Cos Limit Business With Enron After 10Q -Traders By Mark Golden 11/20/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell power and natural gas for next day delivery to Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday morning, a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of Enron's quarterly financial report Monday, traders and other sources said. For weeks, companies have limited both buying and selling with Enron for future deliveries. But for the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies weren't selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month. ""It's pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for now,"" said Charlie Sanchez, energy market manager for Gelber & Associates in Houston. Traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn't sell to Enron Tuesday morning. Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the situation, but declined to say so on the record. ""Nobody will take Enron,"" one western electricity broker said. After struggling, however, that broker eventually found a utility that was willing to sell to Enron Tuesday morning. Calpine, a prominent independent power producer and trader, said it was willing to sell power to Enron. ""We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situation closely,"" spokeswoman Catherine Potter said. The situation Tuesday morning was fluid. One utility that refused to sell to Enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon, a person at the company said. That company's trading, however, was still limited to the spot markets. Credit concerns about the once-dominant energy trading company were heightened with Enron's filing of its third quarter annual report Monday evening with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. Enron may have to pay $690 million on a note that became a demand obligation with the company's most recent credit-rating downgrade, Enron said in Monday's filing. The company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could be hurt by credit concerns, a decline in asset values and reduced trading activity. ""The 10Q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns,"" Fitch analyst Ralph Pellecchia said. ""We have a lot of questions outstanding relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they

Here's what I have so far (who are we supposed to tell about this??) (i)	Broker Margins Approx:	 $50mm Availability:	 End of Week Probability:	 85% Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books. (ii)	Peoples JV Approx:	$135mm Availability:	Within month Probability:	50% We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay. (iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power). Approx:	$25.5mm Availability:	Dependent on whether financing Probability:	50% If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week. (iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank) Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off. 
This is a first pass we have done on the liquidation schedule.  If it is helpful to the process I will have more detail in it.   Let me know. We have also added EIM at the bottom.

Tammie is co-ordinating the trip but essentially there is no current plan for Thursday night but we will need to be there in time for an early start on Friday.  On Friday each of us will meet with John and Mike, have lunch, tour the facilities etc then depart. That's all I know - Tammie is trying to get more details.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year 
We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- +	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub +	Development		Jay Webb +	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster +	HR			David Oxley +	Cash Management	Tom Myers +	Credit			Debbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly. We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually. Customer Side +	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) +	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers Phase  2 Customers Phase  3 Customers +	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) +	Customer visit schedule Product Side +	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week Phase 2 - First Month Phase 3 - First Quarter Target Number of Transactions +	Phase 1 +	Phase 2 +	Phase 3 IT transfer 
FYI: These are the results of the soft targets for Q1. 
Following this morning's meeting, we have agreed to have a fifteen minute conference call on a Thursday morning to give a quick update of issues.  Chris Calger will ensure a list of progress is circulated prior to the two calls.

Ok by me. -------------------------- 
We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR. Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at. Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number. The meeting will be in John's office. Thanks

This really is excellent news and marks the end of a long process.  Thanks = to everyone for all of their efforts. I presume Don will be organizing appropriate celebrations.  Have a good tim= e celebrating! Louise 
Portland Meeting 11:30am 
The meeting is to try and get portland back in line on timings - we clearly should not be in a position to trade physically immediately but within a month.  I am scared by his approach of 120 days for interconnection and 60 for FERC. -------------------------- 
Just so everyone knows who is in the basic teams working on cash please see attached spreadsheet. Please can all team leaders attend the Cash Meeting at 5pm to report on progress. Thanks 
Jay/Dave - as I mentioned Madelon Coover called approx. a week and a half ago trying to get in our good books (or in her words 'resurrect our relationship'). The only two things she said of any interest were the following: - they have developed a WAP/ Palm(?) prototype in Dallas that enables some degree of EnronOnline quotes to this platform (not sure of functionality) - she was clearly keen to show this to us (I did not commit us in any way ) - she also mentioned their Portland office is doing work for EBS , something to do with broadband and that they were 'very happy with their work'. 
Prepared in contemplation of litigation -  Attorney Client Privilege There appears to be no succinct way to write down my thoughts on where we are with El Paso but I'm going to try. Assumption: Kilgore's objective:  Maintain PRM accounting treatment for the swap. Outcome of lawsuit:   Game Over for Kilgore if his accountants disagree with the current PRM treatment and move it to debt thus affecting his      ratios and revolver. What do we want? (i)  To be certain of payment - how important is this really?  Pretty important - but what is this worth is cash terms.  We clearly are in a position   whereby if El Paso evers transfers the contract to an entity which defaults on payment we are exposed.  However,  realistically what are the chances  of them defaulting - very low and, would we win that in court - Yes. (ii)  To monetize the contract - secondary concern with a value to Enron of $15m.  There are potential ways that we could monetize the contracts without disclosing the contract - Joe is working on these.    If there is a way we can do this then our downside from this confidentiality issue is much   smaller as it would cost us more to monetize (thereby bringing in less gain - probably not much of a difference) but can we get the asset off the book?  We are pursuing how far we can get  in terms of 'true sale' treatment with V&E - they will give Joe a view on Wednesday.  There are potential other   ways we can ensure this is off our credit. If we sue them?  Loss of leverage. We potentially open up the issue to a much wider audience and potentially affect Kilgore's accounting treatment - the one thing he wants.  So our leverage has disappeared as we are no longer able to maintain the one thing Kilgore is looking for. Way Forward: We should continue to pursue a commercial solution to the payment issue and monetize the contract through a secondary route.  If we complete monetization through another route then we are exposed to non-payment which could be perceived as very low risk (we have potentially a one year exposure on the back end based on six years statute of limitations).  If we cannot get a way forward on the monetization , then re-review the way forward. We are at risk of them suing us over the confidentiality breach and that would be in New York. Good Luck!

We do not seem to be answering the questions and the format makes it pretty= =20 difficult to understand where we are answering each question.  Is this a=20 style we use with FERC?  If so, fine.  But if not, here's my attempt, I hav= e=20 changed quite a few answers too. Question1: In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessmen= t=20 or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  W= e=20 understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to = do=20 business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness=20 evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does = an=20 instant credit check before confirming the transaction. However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What so= rt=20 of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizi= ng=20 EOL to purchase from Enron? Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter= =20 party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron= =20 utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy. All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any=20 transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being=20 conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal t= o=20 all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on= =20 the telephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  I= n=20 addition, Enron=01,s risk management process is required to be approved by = the=20 Enron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations = as=20 a publicly held company.  Enron=01,s risk policies are provided in Enron=01= ,s=20 publicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on = a=20 quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk= =20 management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron= =20 trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies= . =20 This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the=20 Chairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of= =20 transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In= =20 addition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before th= ey=20 can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group approve= s=20 a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedd= ed=20 within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed through an= =20 electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits a= re=20 not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty=01,s bid or offer vi= a=20 EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there is no huma= n=20 intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit checks=20 utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price= =20 volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on= =20 all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnline doe= s=20 provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or= =20 breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unless CRM is= =20 sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such tha= t=20 credit limit is still available. EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters= =20 into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on= =20 EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General=20 Terms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for= =20 each commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreeme= nt=20 is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilater= al=20 credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on=20 EnronOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to=20 EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between= =20 Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements=20 which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online, should the=20 counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract (for credit or= =20 other reasons), the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact betwee= n=20 the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing= =20 the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them. Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect= =20 data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,= =20 does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL=20 collect, use or manage data regarding cookies? It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's= =20 mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no= =20 capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20 EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20 Question 3: Also, why doesn't EOL publish a ""ticker"" of completed trades=20 showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing= =20 such data?  If yes, when? There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da= ta=20 from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnline= =20 (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides customer= s=20 with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they= =20 acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online chart= s=20 for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices. =20 Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download t= he=20 results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also allows fo= r=20 administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties t= o=20 monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with=20 their own systems. Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron= =20 will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market=20 activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For= =20 example, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas= =20 Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian=20 Enerdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will=20 commence on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes=20 available to all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price o= f=20 that day's transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent i= n=20 this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index. Question 4:  In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron=20 Networks flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used? EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups=20 depending on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that= =20 handles U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling=20 Australian Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back= =20 office utilizing a =01&bridge=018:  a process that is capable of communicat= ing=20 transaction information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. Th= e=20 potential for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the= =20 customer with more efficient recording of the transaction.

We do not seem to be answering the questions and the format makes it pretty= difficult to understand where we are answering each question.  Is this a s= tyle we use with FERC?  If so, fine.  But if not, here's my attempt, I have= changed quite a few answers too. Question1:In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessm= ent or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following= ?  We understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing E= OL to do business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthines= s evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL doe= s an instant credit check before confirming the transaction. However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What so= rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party util= izing EOL to purchase from Enron? Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter p= arty credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron ut= ilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy. All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any trans= action being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conduct= ed over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal to all p= urchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the t= elephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  In add= ition, Enron's risk management process is required to be approved by the En= ron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as= a publicly held company.  Enron's risk policies are provided in Enron's pu= blicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on a = quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk m= anagement group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron = trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies= .  This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the C= hairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of = transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In a= ddition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before the= y can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group appro= ves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are em= bedded within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed thro= ugh an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor l= imits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty's bid or o= ffer via EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there i= s no human intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit = checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future= price volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction f= low on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnl= ine does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit = limits or breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unles= s CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated= such that credit limit is still available. EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters = into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on E= nronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Ter= ms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each= commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreement i= s negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilatera= l credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on Enro= nOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline = transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the= counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the count= erparty chooses to accept or not online, should the counterparty not want t= o accept to language in the contract (for credit or other reasons), the Hel= pdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit grou= p or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to n= egotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them. Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect= data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,= does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL col= lect, use or manage data regarding cookies? It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's= mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no= capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20 EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20 Question 3:Also, why doesn't EOL publish a ""ticker"" of completed trades = showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing= such data?  If yes, when? There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da= ta from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnlin= e (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides custom= ers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which = they acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online = charts for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices= .  Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and downloa= d the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also all= ows for administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterp= arties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in li= ne with their own systems. Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron= will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market ac= tivity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For e= xample, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas = Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En= erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will commen= ce on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available t= o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day'= s transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo= rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index. Question 4: In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Net= works flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used? EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen= ding on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that hand= les U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi= an Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office = utilizing a ""bridge"":  a process that is capable of communicating transacti= on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The potenti= al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom= er with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office system= s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions, = such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk management and= credit.  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all= sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other trading systems, etc.= Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re= gulatory rules, regardless of the source of the transaction.

For e= xample, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas = Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En= erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will commen= ce on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available t= o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day'= s transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo= rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index. Question 4: In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Net= works flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used? EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen= ding on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that hand= les U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi= an Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office = utilizing a ""bridge"":  a process that is capable of communicating transacti= on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The potenti= al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom= er with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office system= s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions, = such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk management and= credit.  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all= sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other trading systems, etc.= Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re= gulatory rules, regardless of the source of the transaction. The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through En= ronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this no= tifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty, = the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi= ed by the system at the same time. =20 The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as= information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a transa= ction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that= captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system.  Enron = Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does, howeve= r, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to our s= ettlement and credit systems. Question 5:Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained = by EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long? EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The tra= nsactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases) m= anaging the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the commo= dity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years pos= t a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this is = policy across all databases. In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free,= real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13 comm= odities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes e-com= merce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously t= ook place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a proprietary, or ""= one-to-many"" trading platform. On a ""one-to-many"" platform, one entity, suc= h as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a ""broker"" type platfor= m). =20 EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t= he second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both = the sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer p= reviously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six month= s, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some prices cou= ld have changed.  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the 'bid and off= er prices"" all the time to make more informed decisions. The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight= as follows:   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") has enforc= ement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for pot= ential manipulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulato= ry authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale. = =20 The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over= financially settled derivatives (swaps and options).  Moreover, pursuant t= o the Commodity Exchange Act (""CEA""), Enron can only trade derivatives with= counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules.  Suc= h transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract = Participants (""ECPs"")(generally, corporations, partnerships and other entit= ies that meet net worth or asset tests). =20 EnronOnline is a proprietary, bilateral trading platform on which Enron is = a principal to every trade.  As such, EnronOnline is not a ""trading facilit= y"" as defined under the CFMA.  As a proprietary platform, EnronOnline uses = Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enro= n and its customers. =20 
We do not seem to be answering the questions and the format makes it pretty= =20 difficult to understand where we are answering each question.  Is this a=20 style we use with FERC?  If so, fine.  But if not, here's my attempt, I hav= e=20 changed quite a few answers too. Question1: In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessmen= t=20 or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  W= e=20 understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to = do=20 business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness=20 evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does = an=20 instant credit check before confirming the transaction. However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What so= rt=20 of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizi= ng=20 EOL to purchase from Enron? Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter= =20 party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron= =20 utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy. All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any=20 transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being=20 conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal t= o=20 all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on= =20 the telephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  I= n=20 addition, Enron=01,s risk management process is required to be approved by = the=20 Enron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations = as=20 a publicly held company.  Enron=01,s risk policies are provided in Enron=01= ,s=20 publicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on = a=20 quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk= =20 management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron= =20 trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies= . =20 This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the=20 Chairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of= =20 transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In= =20 addition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before th= ey=20 can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group approve= s=20 a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedd= ed=20 within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed through an= =20 electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits a= re=20 not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty=01,s bid or offer vi= a=20 EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there is no huma= n=20 intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit checks=20 utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price= =20 volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on= =20 all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnline doe= s=20 provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or= =20 breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unless CRM is= =20 sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such tha= t=20 credit limit is still available. EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters= =20 into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on= =20 EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General=20 Terms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for= =20 each commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreeme= nt=20 is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilater= al=20 credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on=20 EnronOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to=20 EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between= =20 Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements=20 which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online, should the=20 counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract (for credit or= =20 other reasons), the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact betwee= n=20 the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing= =20 the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them. Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect= =20 data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,= =20 does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL=20 collect, use or manage data regarding cookies? It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's= =20 mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no= =20 capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20 EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20 Question 3: Also, why doesn't EOL publish a ""ticker"" of completed trades=20 showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing= =20 such data?  If yes, when? There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da= ta=20 from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnline= =20 (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides customer= s=20 with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they= =20 acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online chart= s=20 for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices. =20 Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download t= he=20 results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also allows fo= r=20 administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties t= o=20 monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with=20 their own systems. Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron= =20 will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market=20 activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For= =20 example, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas= =20 Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian=20 Enerdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will=20 commence on July 1, 2001).

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR. Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at. Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number. The meeting will be in John's office. Thanks 
There is a potential that counterparties will allow us to promote a small group of individuals simultaneous to deal closure.  To facilitate that process, please provide a list of those individuals you would like to promote along with a brief explanation to your HR generalist no later than 12:00 pm on Thursday, January 10, 2002. Please keep in mind that the nominee should have been in his or her current role for at least a year and received a 3 or better rating during the mid-year PRC process.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year 
We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- +	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub +	Development		Jay Webb +	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster +	HR			David Oxley +	Cash Management	Tom Myers +	Credit			Debbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly. We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually. Customer Side +	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) +	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers Phase  2 Customers Phase  3 Customers +	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) +	Customer visit schedule Product Side +	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week Phase 2 - First Month Phase 3 - First Quarter Target Number of Transactions +	Phase 1 +	Phase 2 +	Phase 3 IT transfer 
As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would include spreadsheets etc. Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today. To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement. For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists. Thanks 
FYI: These are the results of the soft targets for Q1. 
Ok by me. -------------------------- 
Tried to call but couldn't reach you - I think we do need to discuss contracts for both of them and find the money for them. I am assuming from this that you are in - which is great news. I will forward to Oxley to make him aware that there is something coming. -------------------------- 
Following this morning's meeting, we have agreed to have a fifteen minute conference call on a Thursday morning to give a quick update of issues.  Chris Calger will ensure a list of progress is circulated prior to the two calls. 
Please find attached the governance schedule for UBSW Energy.

Comments: Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists. Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates. Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion). There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team. Please re-issue today. Louise 
Good question - I will ring you after I have spoken to her. Geoff Storey 03/19/2001 04:01 PM 
I agree with your statements on phase II. I'll start working on the priorities and requirements. Also, what is the status of Colleen? Geof Louise Kitchen 03/19/2001 11:14 AM

Excellent - please circulate for signing 
Zhiyong Thanks for getting me the signed (so far) copy.  (Beth and Philippe, please sign the document today ).  When they have signed please recirculate the final signed copy to everyone. On a going forward basis, please ensure that we receive weekly progress reports including any variances to timeline deliverables (hopefully these will all be early deliveries!). Secondly, please could you deliver the Inception Document for GTVII Phase II by Friday April 6th.  I believe Geof is ready to sit down with you on this. All looks great so far. Any problems - just give me a ring. Thanks 
I take it this is not your final document? 
I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears. Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit down around a desk to look at progress. Let me know what you think? Louise

I'll give you a call in the morning. 
I'm a bit confused - I think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small.  I would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following. Single Deal entry revisions Options reports Transport Valuation in ERMS EOL reporting tools (possible) I would like to see Phase II include the items above and an Inception document re-issued this week. Thanks Louise 
Who is responsible for the upgrade and do we have a plan in place to implement this?

Zhiyong Thanks for getting me the signed (so far) copy.  (Beth and Philippe, please sign the document today ).  When they have signed please recirculate the final signed copy to everyone. On a going forward basis, please ensure that we receive weekly progress reports including any variances to timeline deliverables (hopefully these will all be early deliveries!). Secondly, please could you deliver the Inception Document for GTVII Phase II by Friday April 6th.  I believe Geof is ready to sit down with you on this. All looks great so far. Any problems - just give me a ring. Thanks 
Excellent - please circulate for signing 
Good question - I will ring you after I have spoken to her. Geoff Storey 03/19/2001 04:01 PM 
I agree with your statements on phase II. I'll start working on the priorities and requirements. Also, what is the status of Colleen? Geof Louise Kitchen 03/19/2001 11:14 AM 
Comments: Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists. Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates. Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion). There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team. Please re-issue today. Louise

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears. Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit down around a desk to look at progress. Let me know what you think? Louise

mo NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,= =20 THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA= L=20 DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries= =20 where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via=20 EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,=20 Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the=20 occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the=20 Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or= =20 its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed= =20 currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differ= s=20 in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in= =20 the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms = of=20 our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely= =20 change the analysis below.) Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more=20 significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page ""Executive Summar= y=20 of Legal Advice"" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa= nt=20 legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction= =20 with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus = on=20 issues we raised which are ""all clear"" from a legal perspective, so as to= =20 keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news= =20 too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out belo= w=20 what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, = on=20 the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely= =20 to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a= =20 risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk= =20 is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take. A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b= e=20 delayed Canada, Germany (reasons set out below) C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries) The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and=20 related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks= =20 of a general nature: (i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our=20 counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t= he=20 product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional=20 documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies t= o=20 almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in= =20 all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general= =20 law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under= =20 their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their= =20 constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20 The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20 relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular= ly=20 onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally. (ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure= =20 that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20 counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur= =20 both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ= e=20 formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o= r=20 the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US= =20 counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include= =20 (a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the= =20 procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha= t=20 confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which= =20 we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali= ty=20 agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron= =20 has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o= r=20 otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will= =20 need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou= t=20 such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha= t=20 entity for breach of confidence. D.  Country Specific Issues (i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute= =20 insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the= =20 product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve= =20 this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20 Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear= =20 which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter. (ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in= =20 Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially. (iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be= =20 regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and=20 unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using = a=20 ""substantial professional effort"" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein= g=20 entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our=20 counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad= e=20 by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should=20 therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this= =20 product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic= =20 behind its trading this product type. (iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi= ng=20 relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisor= y=20 authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being=20 unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterpart= y=20 (which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offenc= e=20 will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  Howeve= r,=20 I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing=20 business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue. (v)  US (New York Law)=20 (a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an=20 option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions und= er=20 the US Commodities Exchange Act.=20 (b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product= =20 constitutes a ""security"" under US securities laws (please see attached=20 Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of= =20 securities to ""accredited investors"" which will allow us to deal with=20 investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our=20 counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test shoul= d=20 not impede the business. (c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider=20 trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit= y=20 (see (b) above) is relatively remote. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------------------- Please feel free to call me on x36566 if you would like to discuss this=20 project further. Best regards Paul

PA They wish to amend the PA such that: Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause them to breach any third party rights they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their learning of the same. they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time ETA They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron (see 1(iii)) They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see last sentence of 2(b)) They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e)) They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful default/negligence/omission. They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)). Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points. Please let me know what you think - thanks Justin

Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general= =20 law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under= =20 their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their= =20 constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20 The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20 relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular= ly=20 onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally. (ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure= =20 that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20 counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur= =20 both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ= e=20 formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o= r=20 the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US= =20 counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include= =20 (a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the= =20 procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha= t=20 confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which= =20 we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali= ty=20 agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron= =20 has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o= r=20 otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will= =20 need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou= t=20 such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha= t=20 entity for breach of confidence. D.  Country Specific Issues (i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute= =20 insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the= =20 product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve= =20 this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20 Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear= =20 which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter. (ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in= =20 Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially. (iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be= =20 regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and=20 unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using = a=20 ""substantial professional effort"" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein= g=20 entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our=20 counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad= e=20 by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should=20 therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this= =20 product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic= =20 behind its trading this product type. (iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi= ng=20 relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisor= y=20 authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being=20 unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterpart= y=20 (which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offenc= e=20 will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  Howeve= r,=20 I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing=20 business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue. (v)  US (New York Law)=20 (a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an=20 option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions und= er=20 the US Commodities Exchange Act.=20 (b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product= =20 constitutes a ""security"" under US securities laws (please see attached=20 Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of= =20 securities to ""accredited investors"" which will allow us to deal with=20 investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our=20 counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test shoul= d=20 not impede the business. (c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider=20 trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit= y=20 (see (b) above) is relatively remote. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------------------- Please feel free to call me on x36566 if you would like to discuss this=20 project further. Best regards Paul 
Probably not my place to comment but I haven't seen anything from Bryan yet. We need to find a better way around this no-one is ever going to consent if that is required for specific customers.  But on the major point , having spoken to Bryan over th elast couple of days, I believe he is not going to quote on any entity we have a big relationship with initially.  I have seen the first pass at the list but know that Bryan wasn't happy with it as it included people like TXU. On the other point do you actually mean consent or notification - if we send them a notice, follow up with  a phone call on the big ones then we can make a business decision about how they feel.  Do they actually need to agree on paper? Louise 
Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls. My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity. We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities as soon as possible. Bryan Seyfried 01/19/2000 06:35 AM 
Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them. As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties. Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies for the miscommunication. Call me if you want to discuss further. bs

We have not yet received (and I have checked with Dave) any information with regards to the due diligence completed in terms of how this runs through the EOL system - eg can Guest Users who will have no transaction status when they sign a PA see the numbers?  Do the PA and ETA work for Brankrupcty swaps in each of the jurisdictions will see the swaps?  How many of those jurisdictions .  These are the issues we are to deal with when you give us the due diligence work performed.    We only got the contract today. I know you spoke to Mark Taylor and believe that you discuss  agreed on the 2 weeks timing which I assume is why the 8th March appears.  But please let Dave know if you want to move the dates radically.  We are purely working on 2 weeks from receiving the info as long as you think we'll get it 2 weeks before the 8th March then we should have no problems with the press release below. Comments on questions EnronOnline is not a 24 hour system We don't give out data on numbers of customers on EOL (primarily as its only about 200). Louise Bryan Seyfried 02/18/2000 12:50 PM

We are planning to hold a meeting to kick off the Phase 2 project of EnronOnline on 3rd March in Houston.  This meeting will focus on the new look for the site and content to be added based on our own thoughts and the feedback from customers and our own trading desks. A more strategic meeting on the direction for EnronOnline will be held later. An agenda will be sent out at the beginning of next week.  For those outside of Houston, copies of all presentations will be sent to you and you can participate by phone if you wish. 
Jay/Dave - as I mentioned Madelon Coover called approx. a week and a half ago trying to get in our good books (or in her words 'resurrect our relationship'). The only two things she said of any interest were the following: - they have developed a WAP/ Palm(?) prototype in Dallas that enables some degree of EnronOnline quotes to this platform (not sure of functionality) - she was clearly keen to show this to us (I did not commit us in any way ) - she also mentioned their Portland office is doing work for EBS , something to do with broadband and that they were 'very happy with their work'. 
Can we start thinking about this? Also Dave please chase Bryan again if we haven't received anything as John

Hi Mark, Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from my office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate individuals on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to try to push this forward this week. Please let me know if you need any additional information from HoustonStreet. Best regards, Frank Getman fgetman@houstonstreet.com 
I thought the European/Japan 10% was done ie if we put products we get 10%, ie an option we could decide on later.

Hi all; There is some coverage of Enron Online through a highlighted site of the day on Macromedia.  A company called Hydrogen Interactive is highlighted, and one of the highlighted claim to fames of Hydrogen is some work that they did for Enron Online.    Links below. http://www.macromedia.com/showcase/ http://www.h-i.net/ 
Unfortunately, they had nothing to do with EnronOnline.   It was a promo video we can't use. They were a company that was subcontracted out to do a promotional video for EnronOnline.  The people we contracted with is the one Enron uses for all videos - I believe are suing Hydrogen as the video is unusable. Kal and legal are chasing. David Pope 04/07/2000 05:23

I don't know how much help you will find these, but I attach the process flows diagrams but I tried to get everyone's roles onto paper.  The main areas of note for me in having spent time looking at the process are (BIG CAVEAT is that I probably don't understand everything bearing in mind the small amount of time involved - so apologies first): (i) The definitive legal framework is not yet available.  There appear to be too many documents to click on if you are the customer (ETA, Rules and GTC). The Master issue is also outstanding. Things like the Long Product Description which are fundamentally part of the contract process and their appearance is not clear to me on the website also the adding of new products is not subject to validation.  The easiest short term solution here is to make sure you do not post any products which are not available on EOL - therefore having gone through the process (see launching new products flow chart). (ii) The process is heavily dependent on the Ariba database and manual flows of information between all of the parties.  EOL has an automated email system which emails the notices around, making it less manual.  With the smaller number of players this is not a big risk but the people in ClickPaper Control will need to be high calibre in order to write up the procedures as they are implementing them. (iii) The website currently is only available (I might be wrong but there is only one PA/ETA) to US customers. In case you don't have visio - here they are in PowerPoint. 
We need to ensure that any Brokers (TrueQuote's own included) have no access to transactions entered into by Enron with other counterparties.  Also no access to the information behind the prices that isn't available to others using the website (ie stacks etc).  This would also apply to all of the others in fact I don't think we have restricted this in terms of the price/ volume information available to other equity players in the site. 
Louise & Dave, I haven't received anything from the woman at the IPE but I went to legal and got a copy of the latest Regulations.  I think the attached covers want you want to know but I'm not sure so please let me know if you require any further information. Don't forget I'm not in tomorrow or next week. Speak to you later Snickie 
Should we send something from Enron.  Do you want me to do it - or has someone already? 
EnronOnline Putting the energy into ecommerce and now Taking the big deal out of the big deal. Did we TM these? 
We need some advice on this one - we are not in any negotiation with Altra now and anything we were talking about is under a Confidentiality. Andy needs some advice on how to pursue - obviously it helps them to say the haven't been left out of the loop.  Andy will fill more in. 
Just to follow up, where are we vis-a-vis getting prepared for the No Action Relief application? 
Is there not something better than a percentage?  Noticce the lack of a better answer from me. Andy Zipper@ENRON 22/08/2000 11:44 
I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is commercially reasonable. 
How did we get comfortable with MG charging commission on transactions?

A successful week.  The contractor has been selected and the Letter of Intent has been signed.  We have until the end of next week to sign the full contract.  The delivery of the project will be 18th September although the contract heavily incentivizes the company to complete within 14 weeks of now. 1. Agency.com The discovery process has commenced.  During this period we are bringing together a large number of the team to ensure that the work to be carried out is in line with our requirements.  Members of the team will be commuting to the Agency.com office in Dallas over the next week these include Jay Webb, Marcello Romano, Pat Gogerty,  Chris Dodds and Tilak (for two days). Going forward, Paul Goddard will be the main commercial contact with Agency.com and he will be responsible for accessing the correct information / individuals within Enron as and when required for the Agency.com work.  For the next week Paul will be replaced by Marcello as the interface during discovery whilst Paul ensures that the contract is completed between ourselves and Agency.com.  We are pushing very hard for contract completion early/mid next week. The main commercial terms of the contract include incentives and penalties which hopefully will increase their potential to deliver early: Delivery of application   19th September Estimate of costs   $1.2 million +$100,000 for JE Incentives   $100,000/week earlier than week 14 Penalties   5% of costs/week Exclusivity   18 months (on energy commodities) Documents attached for information: Back up up service provider Anthony has told I-Cube that at the current time they are our number two choice and should we fail to reach agreement on the actual term of the agreement with Agency.com next week, then we will be contacting them to continue negotiations. 2. Trading Team Co-ordination Europe Elena Kapralova Elena has produced initial product descriptions working with the individual trading groups. US   Paul Racicot Paul is working with the North American trader representatives on raising the awareness of the project, he aims to have details on the products by the end of this week.  He has also worked on highlighting the requirements such as staffing and space which need to be pushed in people's minds early in this project to prepare for launch. Both of the above will be co-ordinating feeback sessions with the trader groups on the prototype in approximately 4-5 weeks. 3.  Business Process We now have a fairly substantial team in place for the Business Process side of the project. Europe  David Port      Process Leader Bryan Seyfried/David Weekes   Control / Credit Janine Juggins     Tax US  David Mally      Process Leader Bill Bradford     Control / Credit Tax      TBA David Port is leading the way with scoping out the Business Process side of the project and plans to have completed substantial documentation by the end of this week.  He will be co-ordinating with Dave Mally and a roundtable meeting on the Business Process implementation will be held in the next two weeks in the Houston office. From the OnLine team itself the Business Process is being helped by Arfan Aziz who is currently tasked with creating a counterparty database to facilitate the process of enabling counterparties to trade on the system. 4. PR The approach to developing the site has been agreed with Mark  Palmer.  We have instructed the agency that they are to abide by the guidelines for the Enron Logo and get a feel for the Enron style through the intranet pages, although allowing them fairly free rein with the site initially (up to prototype and under Paul's watch) to use their creative approach to creating the site. Out of interest I spent time with the Design Director this afternoon and the actual sites they have produced are pretty impressive, here are some examples if you are interested. www.british-airways.com www.sprint.com www.benetton.com Another site which I think offers some of the appeal we would need is www.vw.com . Apart from Mark's involvement in the project he has also asked George Tzinas and Marge Nadasky from his team to assist in this project. 5.  Legal and Regulatory US Legal Meeting held with Sullivan & Cromwell.  They are happy with the overall structure of the site conceptually and offered several methods of tightening the process of binding a customer to the transaction on the Click and minimising the risks to Enron.  These are captured within their first draft of the agreements.  These are in first draft format only and have yet to be reviewed by Enron.  The concept we are working with currently for the US market are generic language formats to override current Masters.  The current format which is under review is the idea of an enabling agreement (ie the piece of paper they sign to register) and then a text book on screen to clock on when they enter the site.  I am thinking that we should work towards one document which is much simpler althoughslightly longer. US Regulatory - We will be involving Steve Kean and Cynthia Santer from his group in order to ensure that they remain up to speed with the project. European Regulatory Work has kicked off on compiling the jurisdictional issues with regard to Europe.  We are facing an issue in that each commodity has one GTC and this is difficult (for example German Power would be under German Law for German counterparties and English Law for English counterparties) and we really need to have a default. approximately 5 weeks. 6. Admin The RC number for this project is 2509. My movements - Still one week in Houston one week in London at present. 
Good morning everyone, Thankyou for responding promptly. I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement to something reflecting 'Password Application'. Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today. For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no WHEREAS is a good start. Regards Louise Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
If you look at the attached list we are due to make a lot of these dates in the next two weeks.  The biggest problem in Europe is probably that Edmund is obviously out of the office and there are no dates even for his. These delays are causing chicken and egg problems with the metals customers. We can't mail if there are no pas etc.  The big metals roll-out is in London first week in October so we do need them by then, If there are re-prioritisation issues please contact Bruce Garner who needs them for that week. Please let me know. Thanks Louise Leonardo Pacheco@ENRON 15/09/2000 11:46 
Attached please find the latest version  of the New Markets/Products Report. The report is updated every week. Let me know if you have any questions Thank you! Leonardo Pacheco

Dear all, these are the issues from the last legal meeting that need further attention: 1). European Jurisdictions Peculiarities Slovenia, Cpoatia, Romania must be added to Phase 1 reviews. Products that considered are gas and power both physical and financial. 15 Jurisdictions reviews are already received. So far they do not reveal any fundamental problems with the overall structure. There are few recommendations on the wording of PAA, ETA and GTC to come. CC (Tim Hueges) is summarising all the replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions by Monday (14th) lunch time. Possible complications are: All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into French and Spanish, as part of these  jurisdictions requirements. Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking  validity of signatures => it may need to be reflected in the business processes. It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well, so that potential customers may print them out, fill in and mail to Enron. YES - only in the garden and we will need clear instrucutions on how to register there also 2). Read Only Access for some customers instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement, therefor it has to be drafted ASAP. DRAFTING REQUIRED. THIS IS ALSO A SYSTEM REQUIREMENT FOR READ ONLY. 3). Product Descriptions A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team (Justin Boyd, Mark Taylor) but not CC or S&C. OK 4). Timetable GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June.  First two weeks of July CC will spend validating marketing data.  Project timetable was promised to CC to be e-mailed yesterday.  OK, but timings will vary on the basis of what timetable says. 5). Translation Translation of GTCs, ETA and PPA will be done internally . The first priority languages most likely will be French, German and Spanish. Actions: Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP (Justin Boyd to co-ordinate). Identify languages to  translate into (Elena Kapralova to co-ordinate with Justin and traders) 6). Taxes Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions must be sent to Canada (Janine Juggins to co-ordinate). 7). Web Page Wording The words ""I accept"" and ""Delete"" in the box that appears after a customer clicked on price, are to be changed into ""Submit"" and ""Clear"". Lawyers are comfortable with this. 8). Different Entities on Counterparty Side If there are a few different entities trading for the same company,  for ex. Morgan Stanley International (MSI) and Morgan Stanley (MS), they should be treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate System Administrator passwords. This is necessary for tax considerations. It is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per System Administrator. 9). Authorisation Risk Because Online Trading will be Enron's software, all problems arising from authorisation errors, for ex.  when customer that was supposedly authorised to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power, will be entirely Enron's liability => it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of authorisation functionality of the system in July and August.NO this would only be the case if we reverted to asking them what they wanted to trade and we are not going to do that from a systems process point of view - DAVID _ ISSUE 10). Written and Electronic Confirmations It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating superiority of written vs. electronic confirmations. According to the UK law, an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one, generated and mailed by the Back Office, similar to the current practice for transactions done over the telephone, when phone conversation overwrites all paper conformations. In the US the situation is opposite. For the deals done over the phone, written confirmations still take priority over the phone conversation tape. In Texas anything that is not in writing, is not enforceable. The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be investigated further (Mark Taylor to co-ordinate). The result should be reflected in US version of  ETA. YES This leads to a further question, whether sending written confirmations in UK is still necessary?YES 11). UN E-Commerce Directive There is a daft of UN Directive on e-commerce, which currently has very strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete. It requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc. Enron might be in position to lobby few items in this Directive (Justin and Regulatory Dept.) What th eEU piece asks for is mutual confirmations by clicking - two further stages than we have in our system.  WE need to build a system which can incorporate these changes at some point in the furture but not now. 12). Suspending Trades by Counterparty A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty, for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of deals in the same commodity. It arises two issues: IT -  the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the transaction summary page (bottom of the price page) YES Legal - CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law. NO PROBLEM - BUILD SYSTEM NOW TO DO THIS. Price Check Idea Just a thought, whether  it is technically possible to amend a price check (the one done when the customer submitted a price, and database does credit, GTC and price check) in a way that customer is notified about the price change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron, i.e. if price moved in Enron's  favour transaction should go forward at the price customer had agreed to earlier. Legally it is OK. Jay, can the system do it? YES Internal Issues still to be addressed: 1). Global Liquids Books management, i.e. how responsibilities for price update will be managed  between London and Houston desks.DAVID 2). FX conversion including IT, business processes, tax, risk managment issues (David Port, Janine Juggins, Jay Webb)DAVID All comments are welcome, Regards, Elena

Good morning I spoke to our lawyer yesterday on how we could possibly help you in the work we had done to date.  To be honest the majority of the effort is on the European side (due to the multi jurisdictional issues) and we haven't really done a lot in the US particularly on a state level. Perhaps the most appropriate thing would be for you to give Mark Taylor in ECT legal a ring to discuss the work we have done and see if there is anything you can get to save duplication. Louise

I am not quite sure the context of this - if I were to issue a password to someone (because I was going to give them readonly access) they would not have to sign anything - the requiremetn is for a document to appear on the screen though when they login - a read only ETA.  how doe these fit together? Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Let's be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how to register,  this is what we are doing.  Any comments or problems please reply.  I have tried to address everyone's points (see end of email). 1.  Current Customers We are going to pre-register a large number of customers prior to the launch.   These customers will not  receive any documentation from us apart from the one page application form (Password Application) and a nice glossy marketing brochure. They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation. All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these people. Procedure 1.  A list of customers to be pre-registered is compiled. 2.  Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax, Credit, Legal etc. 3. The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form (postal) and a marketing brochure (this will be very glossy with only high level details nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process (to include whether to send to UK os  US office).  The PA will be specific to each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to each counterparty. 4. The customer signs the document (Password Application) and returns to Enron. 5. Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login. 6.  The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be printable. 7.   The customer then enters the site and transacts.  If the customer is transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not need to be accepted, if the customer is dealing without a master then any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  The system will need to be loaded with the information as to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodity/product type. Elena's questions Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the ""House""?  No only in the garden.  PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be available and printable in the garden (drop down box would be my suggestion). 2.  New Customers There are two alternative routes possible. Procedure 1: Off Line Registration Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade online, i.e. get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for appropriate jurisdiction. Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the system administrator login and password. The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be printable. The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password). Procedure Two:  Partial OnLine Registration Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in the Garden Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out appropriate Registration Form and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it to Enron Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the system administrator login and password. The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be printable. The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password). The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but clearly Janine may want to add more on her side. Elena's questions Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2? Both 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform potential customers that there request for access may not be granted.  YES - In the  garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and that it is solely on our discretion (this is not just for Read Only its for all applications) 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC prefers them to be available...YES 3.  Read Only Customers If a customer / counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are missing.  So we will be sending them a password and login for read only access.  We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but that will be up to the traders - any counterparties wanting access like this would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we would authorise readonly access.  We will no be advertising read only access as available. They will be able to enter the site for a period for time (Enron needs to be capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a customer/counterparty is given read-only access for) unable to transact but view only. Procedure 1.  Either, Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has not registered.  The trading desk with primary trading contact with such counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only access for a period of time. or,   a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only access for one of his customers. 2.  The Product Control Group will issue a password/login which will be time dated (only valid for a certain period). 3. The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA  - these are to be country specific. 4. The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the site where he has been given READ ONLY access. 5.   Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of creating any further passwords (not like a system administrator password). 6. When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they should register to continue seeing prices. Elena's issues 1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where? YES - should be printable when it appears on screen at login (no need for it to be in the garden) 2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th. Needs to be flexible although one password has no capability of creating further passwords, but the period of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader.  Some customers may be allowed in for one day others for one month. 3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted. We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not be mentioned in the garden.  The only phrase in the garden refers to customers who apply for a password may not get access (see above). 4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner way...No this will be signed/clicked online just like the ETAs. Mark's comments System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned. If they are in reality that is none of our concern.  Agreed - we need to change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator ETA acceptance process - we have legal confirmation of your comment? I would expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it (which I think is where Bob is coming from). Only one person per System Administration Password / Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA. Guest only users This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday - and I have some process queries on it. See above. How do we separate/ identify the applications? See above. What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for full rights?  They need to receive a notice when their password expires which prompts them to follow the application process. 2 other queries  - Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade electronically? Need a Read Only ETA - see document for further understanding Limitations to be imposed - where is this being coded and who by? There will be a timetable impact. This is not new and therefore isn't Bob's comments 1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000) The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users. The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders? Probably will be a trader - change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD/ MASTER TRADING PASSWORD 3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get Trading Access Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, single point of reference). The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there will be the registration form, I think we do both alternatives. Tim's comments The process you have described is as I understood things, except that for Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users - Regulators, Lawyers, Brokers, Potential Traders etc).  As we discussed on Wednesday and as Andrew mentioned yesterday, I understood the process to be as follows: The Guest will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation  etc.   If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will  e-mail/fax to the Guest the Read Only ETA.  The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to Enron (by fax or post).  Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password.  The Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest. This will not be in hard copy it will be online, see above we are not going to advertise this read only capability. OK? 
I assume we are going online with this - please confirm Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
This is a copy of a presentation I gave today to the EEL management committee which may be of interest/use to some of you. Louise 
Scott, We have decided to alter the way in which we register people We have decided to send out passwords to all counterparties this summer which are Read Only and only when they return the PA signed do we alter the status of  their password to execution status (subject to eveyone being happy with this). I would like to question the usefulness of the ROETA - why exactly do we need it - I don't seem to be able to figure it out - I propose we get rid of it. Louise Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
This will do. The Password Application is an application only and we reserve the right to refuse your application at our sole discretion.  Thanks Louise Paul - please put on site Edmund Cooper 20/07/99 10:23 
I attach the draft wording (from Clifford Chance, also incorporating Justin's comments) for the statement in the Garden website that submission of the PA does not guarantee that the customer will be issued with a password (Outstanding Legal Issue no. 8). Please forward your comments to myself. Thanks, Edmund. 
I suggest number 2 - everybody happy. 
Louise - I believe we need a copyright notice on every page on the website. AGENCY is aware of this (so far it's only on the Quotes page), however we need to give them the exact wording.  I would suggest one of: 
Attached is the most recent online presentation we have which may be of help/interest and does include latest look and feel. This was a presentation I gave to Skilling yesterday, he was extremely impressed and asked many questions on the project (it lasted 75 minutes) on all aspects of the project. 
I am arriving early to attend a meeting with our copywriters at 11am - please feel free to attend Its with David MIckleberg (212 468 3038) at DMBB Advertising, 7th Floor, 1675 Broadway (between 52nd and 53rd St) at 11am. Following this we move to Sullivan & Cromwell at 14:00.  We (myself and Dave) are scheduled to return to Houston on the 19:45 CO1927 from La Guardia. Please give me a ring - I have a Skilling Business Review this morning which should be over mid afternoon - but I'll ring you at 8:15 your time (just in case your email is still not working). 
Attached is draft 4 of the Operations and Procedures Policy which David has been putting together - this really should highlight all of the issues and facilitate understanding - this is not a final document but if your understanding differs from what is in the document.  It is imperative you repond immediately. Thanks Louise 
For you to look at before Mark  and I get up.  Mark told me he would be speaking to you about the alterations today (your yesterday ) so I hope they make sense. Louise 
What do you guys think about this? Interesting report on successful case brought against internet business which suggests that internet businesses face increasing risk of being sued in any jurisdiction in which their sites can be accessed. Ruling by New York State Supreme Court. Whilst dealing with gaming, as a criminal offence was likely to attract more interest, offshore company had its computers in Antigua but held to be governed by New York State gaming laws because New Yorkers were able to access the site and place bets.

As discussed the table to be completed by August 4th in order for us to start loading the customer profiles into the system. The following worksheet is split into two tabs for the counterparty groups suggested by the North America commercial versus those counterparties suggested by Europe commercial.  The US tab consists of the following information: Column A Fed Tax ID (needed for physical global products counterparties) Column B Country where Headquarters is located Column C State of Incorporation Column D Country of Incorporation Column E Counterparty Name Column F Dunnes Link ID Columns G-CU Product Types/Enron Legal Entity The Europe Tab is set as follows: Column A Country of Incorporation Column B Counterparty Name Column C Dunnes Link ID Columns D-CR Product Types/Enron Legal Entity The matrix is blank assuming that all counterparties can trade all product types/Enron Legal Entity.  The above  responsibility groups will need to perform a detailed review by placing a ""X"" in the intersection of the counterparty/product types indicating that that Product Type should not be offered to that counterparty. This review needs to be completed by no later than cob August 4, 1999 so that we can remain on our overall click trading schedule. Regards, Kevin x73206

The above  responsibility groups will need to perform a detailed review by placing a ""X"" in the intersection of the counterparty/product types indicating that that Product Type should not be offered to that counterparty. This review needs to be completed by no later than cob August 4, 1999 so that we can remain on our overall click trading schedule. Regards, Kevin x73206

AS AGREED BY ALL OF YOU YESTERDAY - see attachment Long day yesterday, but thanks for everyone's help I think we made a lot of progress. 
Please speak to Mark Taylor but all final GTCs were sent by him on the 4/5th August to my team and are in the process of  been loaded into the system. I believe that Mark did not receive any language in time as per meeting discussion. Sandra Hrna 12/08/99 23:58 
Louise/Dave I wanted to follow up with you regarding the general terms and conditions (GTC) for the products to be sold via Enron Online.  Per our memo dated August 5, 1999, the GTCs for coal and power products did not include any tax language.  For Enron's protection, it is imperative that the appropriate tax language be added to these documents.  Please let me know how we can ensure the appropriate tax language is in our online GTC's before we go live. Sandra 
We have agreed (subject to Mike's agreement) to put in the tax language in the contract for all weather ones - as we haven't loaded them yet. Regards L 
Please come back with comments on this document by the end of play Friday, we are going to use this document to send to customers with their passwords (once they have signed the password application agreement. Sorry about the rush but we are moving pretty quickly now. Graphics need to format but content is what I need you to look at. Louise 
On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October. Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in the system for the launch schedule. Thanks Louise Mark, On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs? ie their decision whether to trade or not. 
Just for clarification we did not use Sullivan & Cromwell for the Internet primarily we hired S&C as our financial/regulatory lawyers in the US the Internet issues were covered by Clifford Chance although obviously we were suffering with CC and used S&C to help us out but they had no expertise in the Internet and ecommerce. Louise 
Please ensure Andy Zipper is kept up to speed on this as Andy is in charge of EnronOnline. i will not be able to review this until my return on Jan 8th. Louise 
ie Mark Taylor The only concern he had from a legal perspective was that in the Skilling quote ""Enron as a principle""  - that we might want to change it to ""an Enron company as a principle"". - Minor But he does have a point with the line before - remove the ""just"" as we don't actually match buyers and sellers at all. 
Ohoh 
Not sure if you had seen this language from the NY PSC.  While great, this clearly means that NY PSC commissioners will begin to think alot about how EOL  and its relationships with other Enron companies. Jim 
I would like a view - could you talk to S&C too. Thanks Louise 
History between Ageny.com and I on PR 
We do not seem to be answering the questions and the format makes it pretty= difficult to understand where we are answering each question.  Is this a s= tyle we use with FERC?  If so, fine.  But if not, here's my attempt, I have= changed quite a few answers too. Question1:In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessm= ent or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following= ?  We understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing E= OL to do business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthines= s evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL doe= s an instant credit check before confirming the transaction. However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What so= rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party util= izing EOL to purchase from Enron? Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter p= arty credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron ut= ilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy. All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any trans= action being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conduct= ed over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal to all p= urchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the t= elephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  In add= ition, Enron's risk management process is required to be approved by the En= ron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as= a publicly held company.  Enron's risk policies are provided in Enron's pu= blicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on a = quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk m= anagement group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron = trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies= .  This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the C= hairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of = transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In a= ddition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before the= y can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group appro= ves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are em= bedded within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed thro= ugh an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor l= imits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty's bid or o= ffer via EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there i= s no human intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit = checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future= price volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction f= low on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnl= ine does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit = limits or breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unles= s CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated= such that credit limit is still available. EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters = into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on E= nronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Ter= ms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each= commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreement i= s negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilatera= l credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on Enro= nOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline = transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the= counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the count= erparty chooses to accept or not online, should the counterparty not want t= o accept to language in the contract (for credit or other reasons), the Hel= pdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit grou= p or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to n= egotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them. Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect= data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,= does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL col= lect, use or manage data regarding cookies? It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's= mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no= capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20 EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20 Question 3:Also, why doesn't EOL publish a ""ticker"" of completed trades = showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing= such data?  If yes, when? There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da= ta from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnlin= e (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides custom= ers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which = they acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online = charts for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices= .  Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and downloa= d the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also all= ows for administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterp= arties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in li= ne with their own systems. Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron= will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market ac= tivity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For e= xample, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas = Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En= erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will commen= ce on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available t= o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day'= s transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo= rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index. Question 4: In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Net= works flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used? EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen= ding on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that hand= les U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi= an Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office = utilizing a ""bridge"":  a process that is capable of communicating transacti= on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The potenti= al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom= er with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office system= s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions, = such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk management and= credit.  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all= sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other trading systems, etc.= Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re= gulatory rules, regardless of the source of the transaction. The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through En= ronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this no= tifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty, = the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi= ed by the system at the same time. =20 The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as= information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a transa= ction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that= captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system.  Enron = Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does, howeve= r, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to our s= ettlement and credit systems. Question 5:Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained = by EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long? EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The tra= nsactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases) m= anaging the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the commo= dity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years pos= t a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this is = policy across all databases. In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free,= real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13 comm= odities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes e-com= merce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously t= ook place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a proprietary, or ""= one-to-many"" trading platform. On a ""one-to-many"" platform, one entity, suc= h as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a ""broker"" type platfor= m). =20 EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t= he second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both = the sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer p= reviously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six month= s, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some prices cou= ld have changed.  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the 'bid and off= er prices"" all the time to make more informed decisions. The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight= as follows:   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") has enforc= ement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for pot= ential manipulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulato= ry authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale. = =20 The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over= financially settled derivatives (swaps and options).  Moreover, pursuant t= o the Commodity Exchange Act (""CEA""), Enron can only trade derivatives with= counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules.  Suc= h transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract = Participants (""ECPs"")(generally, corporations, partnerships and other entit= ies that meet net worth or asset tests). =20 EnronOnline is a proprietary, bilateral trading platform on which Enron is = a principal to every trade.  As such, EnronOnline is not a ""trading facilit= y"" as defined under the CFMA.  As a proprietary platform, EnronOnline uses = Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enro= n and its customers. =20

Also Frank I think you'll have to provide a lot of the corporation/equity documentation. Thanks Louise Louise Kitchen 05/16/2000 06:09 AM 
Kitchen) I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be a good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document is in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up). I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal wider than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with the technology. I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to introduce financial transactions? (See attached file: product list.doc) Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early next week to go through the draft. Regards Louise (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. image moved 
Hi Mark, Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from my office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate individuals on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to try to push this forward this week. Please let me know if you need any additional information from HoustonStreet. Best regards, Frank Getman fgetman@houstonstreet.com 
I thought the European/Japan 10% was done ie if we put products we get 10%, ie an option we could decide on later. Any idea also on the financial date as our guys do not think we can make any volume targets without it.  We are working on crude and products. Also Mark please liaise with Frank on the documentation you require from him. Thanks Louise (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. image moved

The spectrononline problem. From initial IT investigation, it appears the domain name is owned by a trader at Alliance Gas.  We have had no knowledge of this until one of our power traders found out yesterday. Please could you advise if we need to do anything (eg notify Spectron , contact the IT resource we located on the web.

excellent ruse!  We heard about this through other brokers who heard it from a counterparty.  However I tried the same for ICAPonline and intercapitalonline after Derek joked with them that we'd done it for all the other brokers, and they had no sites.  I wonder if they'll reserve the sites for themselves now that their minds have been focused, if you were thinking of doing the same for other brokers names, we should get moving. Hope Houston's treating you well, Louis 
According to legal, we have no jurisdiction over the domain name or its use. Therefore we have no reason to become involved ( notify either party etc). Obviously we would not pursue any activity similar to this. Louise ps funny though Louise Kitchen 27/06/2000 09:35

Louise & Dave, I haven't received anything from the woman at the IPE but I went to legal and got a copy of the latest Regulations.  I think the attached covers want you want to know but I'm not sure so please let me know if you require any further information. Don't forget I'm not in tomorrow or next week. Speak to you later Snickie 
Should we send something from Enron.  Do you want me to do it - or has someone already? 
I don't know how much help you will find these, but I attach the process flows diagrams but I tried to get everyone's roles onto paper.  The main areas of note for me in having spent time looking at the process are (BIG CAVEAT is that I probably don't understand everything bearing in mind the small amount of time involved - so apologies first): (i) The definitive legal framework is not yet available.  There appear to be too many documents to click on if you are the customer (ETA, Rules and GTC). The Master issue is also outstanding. Things like the Long Product Description which are fundamentally part of the contract process and their appearance is not clear to me on the website also the adding of new products is not subject to validation.  The easiest short term solution here is to make sure you do not post any products which are not available on EOL - therefore having gone through the process (see launching new products flow chart). (ii) The process is heavily dependent on the Ariba database and manual flows of information between all of the parties.  EOL has an automated email system which emails the notices around, making it less manual.  With the smaller number of players this is not a big risk but the people in ClickPaper Control will need to be high calibre in order to write up the procedures as they are implementing them. (iii) The website currently is only available (I might be wrong but there is only one PA/ETA) to US customers. In case you don't have visio - here they are in PowerPoint. 
We need to ensure that any Brokers (TrueQuote's own included) have no access to transactions entered into by Enron with other counterparties.  Also no access to the information behind the prices that isn't available to others using the website (ie stacks etc).  This would also apply to all of the others in fact I don't think we have restricted this in terms of the price/ volume information available to other equity players in the site. 
Is there not something better than a percentage?  Noticce the lack of a better answer from me. Andy Zipper@ENRON 22/08/2000 11:44 
I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is commercially reasonable. 
We need some advice on this one - we are not in any negotiation with Altra now and anything we were talking about is under a Confidentiality. Andy needs some advice on how to pursue - obviously it helps them to say the haven't been left out of the loop.  Andy will fill more in. 
How did we get comfortable with MG charging commission on transactions? 
EnronOnline Putting the energy into ecommerce and now Taking the big deal out of the big deal. Did we TM these? 
Just to follow up, where are we vis-a-vis getting prepared for the No Action Relief application? 
If you look at the attached list we are due to make a lot of these dates in the next two weeks.  The biggest problem in Europe is probably that Edmund is obviously out of the office and there are no dates even for his. These delays are causing chicken and egg problems with the metals customers. We can't mail if there are no pas etc.  The big metals roll-out is in London first week in October so we do need them by then, If there are re-prioritisation issues please contact Bruce Garner who needs them for that week. Please let me know. Thanks Louise Leonardo Pacheco@ENRON 15/09/2000 11:46

mo NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,= =20 THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA= L=20 DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries= =20 where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via=20 EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,=20 Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the=20 occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the=20 Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or= =20 its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed= =20 currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differ= s=20 in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in= =20 the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms = of=20 our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely= =20 change the analysis below.) Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more=20 significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page ""Executive Summar= y=20 of Legal Advice"" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa= nt=20 legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction= =20 with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus = on=20 issues we raised which are ""all clear"" from a legal perspective, so as to= =20 keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news= =20 too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out belo= w=20 what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, = on=20 the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely= =20 to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a= =20 risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk= =20 is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take. A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b= e=20 delayed Canada, Germany (reasons set out below) C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries) The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and=20 related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks= =20 of a general nature: (i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our=20 counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t= he=20 product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional=20 documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies t= o=20 almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in= =20 all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general= =20 law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under= =20 their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their= =20 constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20 The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20 relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular= ly=20 onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally. (ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure= =20 that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20 counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur= =20 both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ= e=20 formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o= r=20 the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US= =20 counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include= =20 (a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the= =20 procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha= t=20 confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which= =20 we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali= ty=20 agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron= =20 has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o= r=20 otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will= =20 need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou= t=20 such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha= t=20 entity for breach of confidence. D.  Country Specific Issues (i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute= =20 insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the= =20 product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve= =20 this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20 Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear= =20 which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter. (ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in= =20 Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially. (iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be= =20 regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and=20 unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using = a=20 ""substantial professional effort"" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein= g=20 entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our=20 counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad= e=20 by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should=20 therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this= =20 product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic= =20 behind its trading this product type. (iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi= ng=20 relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisor= y=20 authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being=20 unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterpart= y=20 (which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offenc= e=20 will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  Howeve= r,=20 I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing=20 business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue. (v)  US (New York Law)=20 (a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an=20 option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions und= er=20 the US Commodities Exchange Act.=20 (b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product= =20 constitutes a ""security"" under US securities laws (please see attached=20 Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of= =20 securities to ""accredited investors"" which will allow us to deal with=20 investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our=20 counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test shoul= d=20 not impede the business. (c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider=20 trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit= y=20 (see (b) above) is relatively remote. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------------------- Please feel free to call me on x36566 if you would like to discuss this=20 project further.

Remove all references to EnronOnline its unnecessary in this context - suffice to say you will be trading through all the normal Enron methods. Louise Bryan Seyfried 16/02/2000 20:24 
Attached is the letter that we intend to send to CFO/Treasurers of reference credits.  The section on EnronOnline was recommended by Sullivan and Cromwell and reviewed by Goddard, Dilworth and Simons. There may be a few minor edits before it goes out. Thanks bs 
We need some advice on this one - we are not in any negotiation with Altra now and anything we were talking about is under a Confidentiality. Andy needs some advice on how to pursue - obviously it helps them to say the haven't been left out of the loop.  Andy will fill more in. 
Just to follow up, where are we vis-a-vis getting prepared for the No Action Relief application? 
Is there not something better than a percentage?  Noticce the lack of a better answer from me. Andy Zipper@ENRON 22/08/2000 11:44 
I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is commercially reasonable. 
How did we get comfortable with MG charging commission on transactions? 
If you look at the attached list we are due to make a lot of these dates in the next two weeks.  The biggest problem in Europe is probably that Edmund is obviously out of the office and there are no dates even for his. These delays are causing chicken and egg problems with the metals customers. We can't mail if there are no pas etc.  The big metals roll-out is in London first week in October so we do need them by then, If there are re-prioritisation issues please contact Bruce Garner who needs them for that week. Please let me know. Thanks Louise Leonardo Pacheco@ENRON 15/09/2000 11:46

Thank you for your participation in last week's meeting in London, I know both Andy and I found a great deal of value in it. The following actions (I think I have most of them) were distributed, Dave and Amita to follow up: 1. Review of personal data restrictions (Enron Europe) - Justin Boyd 2. Review of personal data restrictions (non US - for those countries covered by US Counsel) - Brent 3. Review of all countries for all products added post launch -  Europe - Justin US plus - Brent 4. Polish Issue - Amita and Justin 5. Press Access - Mark Taylor 6. Comments on the confirmation issues - Mark Taylor & Mark Evans 7. Enron Content - Mark Taylor 8. Additional London based resource - Mark Evans In line with the Slide for US - Justin's name was associated with all items for Europe etc. Thanks 
Jay/Dave - as I mentioned Madelon Coover called approx. a week and a half ago trying to get in our good books (or in her words 'resurrect our relationship'). The only two things she said of any interest were the following: - they have developed a WAP/ Palm(?) prototype in Dallas that enables some degree of EnronOnline quotes to this platform (not sure of functionality) - she was clearly keen to show this to us (I did not commit us in any way ) - she also mentioned their Portland office is doing work for EBS , something to do with broadband and that they were 'very happy with their work'. 
Can we start thinking about this? Also Dave please chase Bryan again if we haven't received anything as John

Probably not my place to comment but I haven't seen anything from Bryan yet. We need to find a better way around this no-one is ever going to consent if that is required for specific customers.  But on the major point , having spoken to Bryan over th elast couple of days, I believe he is not going to quote on any entity we have a big relationship with initially.  I have seen the first pass at the list but know that Bryan wasn't happy with it as it included people like TXU. On the other point do you actually mean consent or notification - if we send them a notice, follow up with  a phone call on the big ones then we can make a business decision about how they feel.  Do they actually need to agree on paper? Louise 
Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls. My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity. We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities as soon as possible. Bryan Seyfried 01/19/2000 06:35 AM 
Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them. As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties. Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies for the miscommunication. Call me if you want to discuss further. bs 
Ohoh 
Not sure if you had seen this language from the NY PSC.  While great, this clearly means that NY PSC commissioners will begin to think alot about how EOL  and its relationships with other Enron companies. Jim

Kitchen) I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be a good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document is in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up). I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal wider than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with the technology. I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to introduce financial transactions? (See attached file: product list.doc) Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early next week to go through the draft. Regards Louise (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. image moved 
Hi Mark, Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from my office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate individuals on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to try to push this forward this week. Please let me know if you need any additional information from HoustonStreet. Best regards, Frank Getman fgetman@houstonstreet.com 
I thought the European/Japan 10% was done ie if we put products we get 10%, ie an option we could decide on later. Any idea also on the financial date as our guys do not think we can make any volume targets without it.  We are working on crude and products. Also Mark please liaise with Frank on the documentation you require from him. Thanks Louise (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. image moved

Unfortunately, they had nothing to do with EnronOnline.   It was a promo video we can't use. They were a company that was subcontracted out to do a promotional video for EnronOnline.  The people we contracted with is the one Enron uses for all videos - I believe are suing Hydrogen as the video is unusable. Kal and legal are chasing. David Pope 04/07/2000 05:23 
Hi all; There is some coverage of Enron Online through a highlighted site of the day on Macromedia.  A company called Hydrogen Interactive is highlighted, and one of the highlighted claim to fames of Hydrogen is some work that they did for Enron Online.  This should increase Enron exposure in the techworld as this macromedia site is well followed.  Links below. http://www.macromedia.com/showcase/ http://www.h-i.net/ 
I don't know how much help you will find these, but I attach the process flows diagrams but I tried to get everyone's roles onto paper.  The main areas of note for me in having spent time looking at the process are (BIG CAVEAT is that I probably don't understand everything bearing in mind the small amount of time involved - so apologies first): (i) The definitive legal framework is not yet available.  There appear to be too many documents to click on if you are the customer (ETA, Rules and GTC). The Master issue is also outstanding. Things like the Long Product Description which are fundamentally part of the contract process and their appearance is not clear to me on the website also the adding of new products is not subject to validation.  The easiest short term solution here is to make sure you do not post any products which are not available on EOL - therefore having gone through the process (see launching new products flow chart). (ii) The process is heavily dependent on the Ariba database and manual flows of information between all of the parties.  EOL has an automated email system which emails the notices around, making it less manual.  With the smaller number of players this is not a big risk but the people in ClickPaper Control will need to be high calibre in order to write up the procedures as they are implementing them. (iii) The website currently is only available (I might be wrong but there is only one PA/ETA) to US customers. In case you don't have visio - here they are in PowerPoint. 
On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October. Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in the system for the launch schedule. Thanks Louise Mark, On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs? ie their decision whether to trade or not. 
Just for clarification we did not use Sullivan & Cromwell for the Internet primarily we hired S&C as our financial/regulatory lawyers in the US the Internet issues were covered by Clifford Chance although obviously we were suffering with CC and used S&C to help us out but they had no expertise in the Internet and ecommerce. Louise 
ie Mark Taylor The only concern he had from a legal perspective was that in the Skilling quote ""Enron as a principle""  - that we might want to change it to ""an Enron company as a principle"". - Minor But he does have a point with the line before - remove the ""just"" as we don't actually match buyers and sellers at all. 
I would like a view - could you talk to S&C too. Thanks Louise 
Please deal with this for me - but my initial thoughts are that we cannot address the majority of these. Thanks 
I'm running out of time - can you handle? Thanks, Dave 
PA They wish to amend the PA such that: Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause them to breach any third party rights they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their learning of the same. they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time ETA They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron (see 1(iii)) They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see last sentence of 2(b)) They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e)) They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful default/negligence/omission. They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)). Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points. Please let me know what you think - thanks Justin

Dear all, these are the issues from the last legal meeting that need further attention: 1). European Jurisdictions Peculiarities Slovenia, Cpoatia, Romania must be added to Phase 1 reviews. Products that considered are gas and power both physical and financial. 15 Jurisdictions reviews are already received. So far they do not reveal any fundamental problems with the overall structure. There are few recommendations on the wording of PAA, ETA and GTC to come. CC (Tim Hueges) is summarising all the replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions by Monday (14th) lunch time. Possible complications are: All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into French and Spanish, as part of these  jurisdictions requirements. Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking  validity of signatures => it may need to be reflected in the business processes. It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well, so that potential customers may print them out, fill in and mail to Enron. YES - only in the garden and we will need clear instrucutions on how to register there also 2). Read Only Access for some customers instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement, therefor it has to be drafted ASAP. DRAFTING REQUIRED. THIS IS ALSO A SYSTEM REQUIREMENT FOR READ ONLY. 3). Product Descriptions A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team (Justin Boyd, Mark Taylor) but not CC or S&C. OK 4). Timetable GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June.  First two weeks of July CC will spend validating marketing data.  Project timetable was promised to CC to be e-mailed yesterday.  OK, but timings will vary on the basis of what timetable says. 5). Translation Translation of GTCs, ETA and PPA will be done internally . The first priority languages most likely will be French, German and Spanish. Actions: Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP (Justin Boyd to co-ordinate). Identify languages to  translate into (Elena Kapralova to co-ordinate with Justin and traders) 6). Taxes Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions must be sent to Canada (Janine Juggins to co-ordinate). 7). Web Page Wording The words ""I accept"" and ""Delete"" in the box that appears after a customer clicked on price, are to be changed into ""Submit"" and ""Clear"". Lawyers are comfortable with this. 8). Different Entities on Counterparty Side If there are a few different entities trading for the same company,  for ex. Morgan Stanley International (MSI) and Morgan Stanley (MS), they should be treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate System Administrator passwords. This is necessary for tax considerations. It is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per System Administrator. 9). Authorisation Risk Because Online Trading will be Enron's software, all problems arising from authorisation errors, for ex.  when customer that was supposedly authorised to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power, will be entirely Enron's liability => it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of authorisation functionality of the system in July and August.NO this would only be the case if we reverted to asking them what they wanted to trade and we are not going to do that from a systems process point of view - DAVID _ ISSUE 10). Written and Electronic Confirmations It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating superiority of written vs. electronic confirmations. According to the UK law, an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one, generated and mailed by the Back Office, similar to the current practice for transactions done over the telephone, when phone conversation overwrites all paper conformations. In the US the situation is opposite. For the deals done over the phone, written confirmations still take priority over the phone conversation tape. In Texas anything that is not in writing, is not enforceable. The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be investigated further (Mark Taylor to co-ordinate). The result should be reflected in US version of  ETA. YES This leads to a further question, whether sending written confirmations in UK is still necessary?YES 11). UN E-Commerce Directive There is a daft of UN Directive on e-commerce, which currently has very strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete. It requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc. Enron might be in position to lobby few items in this Directive (Justin and Regulatory Dept.) What th eEU piece asks for is mutual confirmations by clicking - two further stages than we have in our system.  WE need to build a system which can incorporate these changes at some point in the furture but not now. 12). Suspending Trades by Counterparty A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty, for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of deals in the same commodity. It arises two issues: IT -  the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the transaction summary page (bottom of the price page) YES Legal - CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law. NO PROBLEM - BUILD SYSTEM NOW TO DO THIS. Price Check Idea Just a thought, whether  it is technically possible to amend a price check (the one done when the customer submitted a price, and database does credit, GTC and price check) in a way that customer is notified about the price change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron, i.e. if price moved in Enron's  favour transaction should go forward at the price customer had agreed to earlier. Legally it is OK. Jay, can the system do it? YES Internal Issues still to be addressed: 1). Global Liquids Books management, i.e. how responsibilities for price update will be managed  between London and Houston desks.DAVID 2). FX conversion including IT, business processes, tax, risk managment issues (David Port, Janine Juggins, Jay Webb)DAVID All comments are welcome, Regards, Elena

Good morning I spoke to our lawyer yesterday on how we could possibly help you in the work we had done to date.  To be honest the majority of the effort is on the European side (due to the multi jurisdictional issues) and we haven't really done a lot in the US particularly on a state level. Perhaps the most appropriate thing would be for you to give Mark Taylor in ECT legal a ring to discuss the work we have done and see if there is anything you can get to save duplication. Louise 
Let's be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how to register,  this is what we are doing.  Any comments or problems please reply.  I have tried to address everyone's points (see end of email). 1.  Current Customers We are going to pre-register a large number of customers prior to the launch.   These customers will not  receive any documentation from us apart from the one page application form (Password Application) and a nice glossy marketing brochure. They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation. All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these people. Procedure 1.  A list of customers to be pre-registered is compiled. 2.  Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax, Credit, Legal etc. 3. The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form (postal) and a marketing brochure (this will be very glossy with only high level details nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process (to include whether to send to UK os  US office).  The PA will be specific to each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to each counterparty. 4. The customer signs the document (Password Application) and returns to Enron. 5. Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login. 6.  The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be printable. 7.   The customer then enters the site and transacts.  If the customer is transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not need to be accepted, if the customer is dealing without a master then any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  The system will need to be loaded with the information as to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodity/product type. Elena's questions Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the ""House""?  No only in the garden.  PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be available and printable in the garden (drop down box would be my suggestion). 2.  New Customers There are two alternative routes possible. Procedure 1: Off Line Registration Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade online, i.e. get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for appropriate jurisdiction. Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the system administrator login and password. The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be printable. The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password). Procedure Two:  Partial OnLine Registration Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in the Garden Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out appropriate Registration Form and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it to Enron Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the system administrator login and password. The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be printable. The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password). The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but clearly Janine may want to add more on her side. Elena's questions Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2? Both 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform potential customers that there request for access may not be granted.  YES - In the  garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and that it is solely on our discretion (this is not just for Read Only its for all applications) 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC prefers them to be available...YES 3.  Read Only Customers If a customer / counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are missing.  So we will be sending them a password and login for read only access.  We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but that will be up to the traders - any counterparties wanting access like this would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we would authorise readonly access.  We will no be advertising read only access as available. They will be able to enter the site for a period for time (Enron needs to be capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a customer/counterparty is given read-only access for) unable to transact but view only. Procedure 1.  Either, Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has not registered.  The trading desk with primary trading contact with such counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only access for a period of time. or,   a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only access for one of his customers. 2.  The Product Control Group will issue a password/login which will be time dated (only valid for a certain period). 3. The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA  - these are to be country specific. 4. The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the site where he has been given READ ONLY access. 5.   Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of creating any further passwords (not like a system administrator password). 6. When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they should register to continue seeing prices. Elena's issues 1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where? YES - should be printable when it appears on screen at login (no need for it to be in the garden) 2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th. Needs to be flexible although one password has no capability of creating further passwords, but the period of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader.  Some customers may be allowed in for one day others for one month. 3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted. We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not be mentioned in the garden.  The only phrase in the garden refers to customers who apply for a password may not get access (see above). 4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner way...No this will be signed/clicked online just like the ETAs. Mark's comments System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned. If they are in reality that is none of our concern.  Agreed - we need to change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator ETA acceptance process - we have legal confirmation of your comment? I would expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it (which I think is where Bob is coming from). Only one person per System Administration Password / Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA. Guest only users This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday - and I have some process queries on it. See above. How do we separate/ identify the applications? See above. What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for full rights?  They need to receive a notice when their password expires which prompts them to follow the application process. 2 other queries  - Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade electronically? Need a Read Only ETA - see document for further understanding Limitations to be imposed - where is this being coded and who by? There will be a timetable impact. This is not new and therefore isn't Bob's comments 1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000) The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users. The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders? Probably will be a trader - change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD/ MASTER TRADING PASSWORD 3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get Trading Access Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, single point of reference). The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there will be the registration form, I think we do both alternatives. Tim's comments The process you have described is as I understood things, except that for Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users - Regulators, Lawyers, Brokers, Potential Traders etc).  As we discussed on Wednesday and as Andrew mentioned yesterday, I understood the process to be as follows: The Guest will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation  etc.   If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will  e-mail/fax to the Guest the Read Only ETA.  The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to Enron (by fax or post).  Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password.  The Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest. This will not be in hard copy it will be online, see above we are not going to advertise this read only capability. OK? 
I assume we are going online with this - please confirm Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
This is a copy of a presentation I gave today to the EEL management committee which may be of interest/use to some of you. Louise 
Scott, We have decided to alter the way in which we register people We have decided to send out passwords to all counterparties this summer which are Read Only and only when they return the PA signed do we alter the status of  their password to execution status (subject to eveyone being happy with this). I would like to question the usefulness of the ROETA - why exactly do we need it - I don't seem to be able to figure it out - I propose we get rid of it. Louise Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
This will do. The Password Application is an application only and we reserve the right to refuse your application at our sole discretion.  Thanks Louise Paul - please put on site Edmund Cooper 20/07/99 10:23 
I attach the draft wording (from Clifford Chance, also incorporating Justin's comments) for the statement in the Garden website that submission of the PA does not guarantee that the customer will be issued with a password (Outstanding Legal Issue no. 8). Please forward your comments to myself. Thanks, Edmund. 
I suggest number 2 - everybody happy. 
Louise - I believe we need a copyright notice on every page on the website. AGENCY is aware of this (so far it's only on the Quotes page), however we need to give them the exact wording.  I would suggest one of: 
Attached is the most recent online presentation we have which may be of help/interest and does include latest look and feel. This was a presentation I gave to Skilling yesterday, he was extremely impressed and asked many questions on the project (it lasted 75 minutes) on all aspects of the project. 
I am arriving early to attend a meeting with our copywriters at 11am - please feel free to attend Its with David MIckleberg (212 468 3038) at DMBB Advertising, 7th Floor, 1675 Broadway (between 52nd and 53rd St) at 11am. Following this we move to Sullivan & Cromwell at 14:00.  We (myself and Dave) are scheduled to return to Houston on the 19:45 CO1927 from La Guardia. Please give me a ring - I have a Skilling Business Review this morning which should be over mid afternoon - but I'll ring you at 8:15 your time (just in case your email is still not working). 
For you to look at before Mark  and I get up.  Mark told me he would be speaking to you about the alterations today (your yesterday ) so I hope they make sense. Louise 
What do you guys think about this? Interesting report on successful case brought against internet business which suggests that internet businesses face increasing risk of being sued in any jurisdiction in which their sites can be accessed. Ruling by New York State Supreme Court. Whilst dealing with gaming, as a criminal offence was likely to attract more interest, offshore company had its computers in Antigua but held to be governed by New York State gaming laws because New Yorkers were able to access the site and place bets. Regards Louise Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
AS AGREED BY ALL OF YOU YESTERDAY - see attachment Long day yesterday, but thanks for everyone's help I think we made a lot of progress. 
Please speak to Mark Taylor but all final GTCs were sent by him on the 4/5th August to my team and are in the process of  been loaded into the system. I believe that Mark did not receive any language in time as per meeting discussion. Sandra Hrna 12/08/99 23:58 
Louise/Dave I wanted to follow up with you regarding the general terms and conditions (GTC) for the products to be sold via Enron Online.  Per our memo dated August 5, 1999, the GTCs for coal and power products did not include any tax language.  For Enron's protection, it is imperative that the appropriate tax language be added to these documents.  Please let me know how we can ensure the appropriate tax language is in our online GTC's before we go live. Sandra 
Good morning everyone, Thankyou for responding promptly. I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement to something reflecting 'Password Application'. Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today. For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no WHEREAS is a good start. Regards Louise Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
We have agreed (subject to Mike's agreement) to put in the tax language in the contract for all weather ones - as we haven't loaded them yet. Regards L 
Please come back with comments on this document by the end of play Friday, we are going to use this document to send to customers with their passwords (once they have signed the password application agreement. Sorry about the rush but we are moving pretty quickly now. Graphics need to format but content is what I need you to look at. Louise 
Probably not my place to comment but I haven't seen anything from Bryan yet. We need to find a better way around this no-one is ever going to consent if that is required for specific customers.  But on the major point , having spoken to Bryan over th elast couple of days, I believe he is not going to quote on any entity we have a big relationship with initially.  I have seen the first pass at the list but know that Bryan wasn't happy with it as it included people like TXU. On the other point do you actually mean consent or notification - if we send them a notice, follow up with  a phone call on the big ones then we can make a business decision about how they feel.  Do they actually need to agree on paper? Louise 
Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls. My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity. We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities as soon as possible.

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them. As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties. Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies for the miscommunication. Call me if you want to discuss further. bs 
Thanks very much for your memo Paul it is very helpful.  I attach below for= =20 completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on= =20 EnronOnline. =20 There are two remaining issues which require further thought:- 1.  How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline. = =20 For the short term, we can put credit out there but the number of updates= =20 will be restricted.  Using Jay's best guess on a slow network connection th= e=20 initialization process will take upto 4 minutes and on a normal connection= =20 250 updates every 30 seconds would prevent people from trading.   So we do= =20 have some scaling issues? Our model doesn't really function for simultaneou= se=20 changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much= =20 better specific on how many updates you envisage.   Do you really envisage= =20 that many updates?  Also we haven't yet experienced fast updates which we= =20 will do when FX joins the system. 2.  We have approximately 4000 guest id and passwords?  Can these see credi= t=20 pricing from a due diligence perspective. Elena will be leaving the EnronOnline group at the end of this week and Mar= k=20 Dilworth will be our main point of contact in Dave's absence.

mo NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,= =20 THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA= L=20 DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries= =20 where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via=20 EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,=20 Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the=20 occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the=20 Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or= =20 its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed= =20 currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differ= s=20 in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in= =20 the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms = of=20 our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely= =20 change the analysis below.) Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more=20 significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page ""Executive Summar= y=20 of Legal Advice"" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa= nt=20 legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction= =20 with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus = on=20 issues we raised which are ""all clear"" from a legal perspective, so as to= =20 keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news= =20 too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out belo= w=20 what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, = on=20 the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely= =20 to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a= =20 risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk= =20 is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take. A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b= e=20 delayed Canada, Germany (reasons set out below) C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries) The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and=20 related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks= =20 of a general nature: (i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our=20 counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t= he=20 product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional=20 documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies t= o=20 almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in= =20 all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general= =20 law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under= =20 their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their= =20 constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20 The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20 relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular= ly=20 onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally. (ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure= =20 that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20 counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur= =20 both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ= e=20 formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o= r=20 the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US= =20 counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include= =20 (a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the= =20 procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha= t=20 confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which= =20 we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali= ty=20 agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron= =20 has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o= r=20 otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will= =20 need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou= t=20 such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha= t=20 entity for breach of confidence. D.  Country Specific Issues (i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute= =20 insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the= =20 product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve= =20 this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20 Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear= =20 which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter. (ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in= =20 Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially. (iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be= =20 regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and=20 unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using = a=20 ""substantial professional effort"" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein= g=20 entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our=20 counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad= e=20 by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should=20 therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this= =20 product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic= =20 behind its trading this product type. (iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi= ng=20 relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisor= y=20 authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being=20 unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterpart= y=20 (which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offenc= e=20 will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  Howeve= r,=20 I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing=20 business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue. (v)  US (New York Law)=20 (a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an=20 option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions und= er=20 the US Commodities Exchange Act.=20 (b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product= =20 constitutes a ""security"" under US securities laws (please see attached=20 Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of= =20 securities to ""accredited investors"" which will allow us to deal with=20 investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our=20 counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test shoul= d=20 not impede the business. (c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider=20 trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit= y=20 (see (b) above) is relatively remote. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------------------- Please feel free to call me on x36566 if you would like to discuss this=20 project further. Best regards Paul 
Separately to Bryan - nothing to do with EOL 
We have not yet received (and I have checked with Dave) any information with regards to the due diligence completed in terms of how this runs through the EOL system - eg can Guest Users who will have no transaction status when they sign a PA see the numbers?  Do the PA and ETA work for Brankrupcty swaps in each of the jurisdictions will see the swaps?  How many of those jurisdictions .  These are the issues we are to deal with when you give us the due diligence work performed.    We only got the contract today. I know you spoke to Mark Taylor and believe that you discuss  agreed on the 2 weeks timing which I assume is why the 8th March appears.  But please let Dave know if you want to move the dates radically.  We are purely working on 2 weeks from receiving the info as long as you think we'll get it 2 weeks before the 8th March then we should have no problems with the press release below. Comments on questions EnronOnline is not a 24 hour system We don't give out data on numbers of customers on EOL (primarily as its only about 200). Louise Bryan Seyfried 02/18/2000 12:50 PM 
Louise - we are adament about including EnronOnline in the initial press release with a firm date for bringing the products onto the platform.  Please have a look at the current version and let us know your thoughts. If you would like to discuss please give me a call. Thanks bs

We are experiencing an high level of cusotmers wishing to speak to a lawyer on the EnronOnline agreements and bearing in mind you have other jobs we need to have someone permanently manning the phone for all the industrials.  Could you get another Edmund type working for you who mans the phones permanently so we can get people on the system immediately. Thanks 
Attached is draft 4 of the Operations and Procedures Policy which David has been putting together - this really should highlight all of the issues and facilitate understanding - this is not a final document but if your understanding differs from what is in the document.  It is imperative you repond immediately. Thanks Louise 
I thought the European/Japan 10% was done ie if we put products we get 10%, ie an option we could decide on later. Any idea also on the financial date as our guys do not think we can make any volume targets without it.  We are working on crude and products. Also Mark please liaise with Frank on the documentation you require from him. Thanks Louise (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. image moved 
Also Frank I think you'll have to provide a lot of the corporation/equity documentation. Thanks Louise Louise Kitchen 05/16/2000 06:09 AM 
Kitchen) I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be a good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document is in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up). I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal wider than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with the technology. I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to introduce financial transactions? (See attached file: product list.doc) Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early next week to go through the draft. Regards Louise (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. image moved 
Hi Mark, Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from my office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate individuals on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to try to push this forward this week. Please let me know if you need any additional information from HoustonStreet. Best regards, Frank Getman fgetman@houstonstreet.com

I am not quite sure the context of this - if I were to issue a password to someone (because I was going to give them readonly access) they would not have to sign anything - the requiremetn is for a document to appear on the screen though when they login - a read only ETA.  how doe these fit together?

As discussed the table to be completed by August 4th in order for us to start loading the customer profiles into the system. The following worksheet is split into two tabs for the counterparty groups suggested by the North America commercial versus those counterparties suggested by Europe commercial.  The US tab consists of the following information: Column A Fed Tax ID (needed for physical global products counterparties) Column B Country where Headquarters is located Column C State of Incorporation Column D Country of Incorporation Column E Counterparty Name Column F Dunnes Link ID Columns G-CU Product Types/Enron Legal Entity The Europe Tab is set as follows: Column A Country of Incorporation Column B Counterparty Name Column C Dunnes Link ID Columns D-CR Product Types/Enron Legal Entity The matrix is blank assuming that all counterparties can trade all product types/Enron Legal Entity.  The above  responsibility groups will need to perform a detailed review by placing a ""X"" in the intersection of the counterparty/product types indicating that that Product Type should not be offered to that counterparty. This review needs to be completed by no later than cob August 4, 1999 so that we can remain on our overall click trading schedule. Regards, Kevin x73206

A successful week.  The contractor has been selected and the Letter of Intent has been signed.  We have until the end of next week to sign the full contract.  The delivery of the project will be 18th September although the contract heavily incentivizes the company to complete within 14 weeks of now. 1. Agency.com The discovery process has commenced.  During this period we are bringing together a large number of the team to ensure that the work to be carried out is in line with our requirements.  Members of the team will be commuting to the Agency.com office in Dallas over the next week these include Jay Webb, Marcello Romano, Pat Gogerty,  Chris Dodds and Tilak (for two days). Going forward, Paul Goddard will be the main commercial contact with Agency.com and he will be responsible for accessing the correct information / individuals within Enron as and when required for the Agency.com work.  For the next week Paul will be replaced by Marcello as the interface during discovery whilst Paul ensures that the contract is completed between ourselves and Agency.com.  We are pushing very hard for contract completion early/mid next week. The main commercial terms of the contract include incentives and penalties which hopefully will increase their potential to deliver early: Delivery of application   19th September Estimate of costs   $1.2 million +$100,000 for JE Incentives   $100,000/week earlier than week 14 Penalties   5% of costs/week Exclusivity   18 months (on energy commodities) Documents attached for information: Back up up service provider Anthony has told I-Cube that at the current time they are our number two choice and should we fail to reach agreement on the actual term of the agreement with Agency.com next week, then we will be contacting them to continue negotiations. 2. Trading Team Co-ordination Europe Elena Kapralova Elena has produced initial product descriptions working with the individual trading groups. US   Paul Racicot Paul is working with the North American trader representatives on raising the awareness of the project, he aims to have details on the products by the end of this week.  He has also worked on highlighting the requirements such as staffing and space which need to be pushed in people's minds early in this project to prepare for launch. Both of the above will be co-ordinating feeback sessions with the trader groups on the prototype in approximately 4-5 weeks. 3.  Business Process We now have a fairly substantial team in place for the Business Process side of the project. Europe  David Port      Process Leader Bryan Seyfried/David Weekes   Control / Credit Janine Juggins     Tax US  David Mally      Process Leader Bill Bradford     Control / Credit Tax      TBA David Port is leading the way with scoping out the Business Process side of the project and plans to have completed substantial documentation by the end of this week.  He will be co-ordinating with Dave Mally and a roundtable meeting on the Business Process implementation will be held in the next two weeks in the Houston office. From the OnLine team itself the Business Process is being helped by Arfan Aziz who is currently tasked with creating a counterparty database to facilitate the process of enabling counterparties to trade on the system. 4. PR The approach to developing the site has been agreed with Mark  Palmer.  We have instructed the agency that they are to abide by the guidelines for the Enron Logo and get a feel for the Enron style through the intranet pages, although allowing them fairly free rein with the site initially (up to prototype and under Paul's watch) to use their creative approach to creating the site. Out of interest I spent time with the Design Director this afternoon and the actual sites they have produced are pretty impressive, here are some examples if you are interested. www.british-airways.com www.sprint.com www.benetton.com Another site which I think offers some of the appeal we would need is www.vw.com . Apart from Mark's involvement in the project he has also asked George Tzinas and Marge Nadasky from his team to assist in this project. 5.  Legal and Regulatory US Legal Meeting held with Sullivan & Cromwell.  They are happy with the overall structure of the site conceptually and offered several methods of tightening the process of binding a customer to the transaction on the Click and minimising the risks to Enron.  These are captured within their first draft of the agreements.  These are in first draft format only and have yet to be reviewed by Enron.  The concept we are working with currently for the US market are generic language formats to override current Masters.  The current format which is under review is the idea of an enabling agreement (ie the piece of paper they sign to register) and then a text book on screen to clock on when they enter the site.  I am thinking that we should work towards one document which is much simpler althoughslightly longer. US Regulatory - We will be involving Steve Kean and Cynthia Santer from his group in order to ensure that they remain up to speed with the project. European Regulatory Work has kicked off on compiling the jurisdictional issues with regard to Europe.  We are facing an issue in that each commodity has one GTC and this is difficult (for example German Power would be under German Law for German counterparties and English Law for English counterparties) and we really need to have a default. approximately 5 weeks. 6. Admin The RC number for this project is 2509. My movements - Still one week in Houston one week in London at present. 
We recognize that we are experiencing a difficult time at Enron now and you are all interfacing with our customers every day.  We are therefore holding a  short meeting at 9:00am tomorrow morning to answer questions from you and your groups. Tammie to advise on the room.  Please invite all of your groups. 
Ted, 
Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both; (i) Correct, and (ii) Correctly allocated Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith. Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352. Thanks 
We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- +	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub +	Development		Jay Webb +	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster +	HR			David Oxley +	Cash Management	Tom Myers +	Credit			Debbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly. We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually. Customer Side +	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) +	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers Phase  2 Customers Phase  3 Customers +	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) +	Customer visit schedule Product Side +	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week Phase 2 - First Month Phase 3 - First Quarter Target Number of Transactions +	Phase 1 +	Phase 2 +	Phase 3 IT transfer 
The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year 
Just so everyone knows who is in the basic teams working on cash please see attached spreadsheet. Please can all team leaders attend the Cash Meeting at 5pm to report on progress. Thanks

Mary is working up all the options on severance and furloughs.  She will have all the data and legal perspectives whenever we need to push a botton if we button. 
There is a lot of confidential information here (in items 1and 2) Detailed monthly P&L covering all trading activity for the last three years Potential Exposure by sector (eg gas and electricity utility) Detailed monthly P&L covering all trading activity for the last three years. 
Payments are seen by Treasury, Bowen and Me (as Cash person at the moment).  Payments of the specific nature we are talking about would not be seen by anyone outside  that group.  Hickerson only sees aggregate cash and new bank accounts (whihc is how he saw Swapco). 
We all attended (parts of) a day long event which I believe Vince is hosting on Wharton and a project they are doing for us, I personally would like to see the results of that before doing more with Wharton as overall Vince and Jeff Shankman have Wharton pretty well covered. Louise Christie Patrick 05/21/2001 07:01 PM 
Guys-- First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance) Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton. The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level. Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research. Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives. O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about?? As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc. A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an ""Enron brain drain"" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron). The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion. ALL comments solicited---- Many thanks!! --Christie. 
Christie, Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the ""From Browsers to Buyers: Online Conversion Workshop"" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from Enron are interested in attending.

Let's discuss - there were quite a few changes to be done first. The first place to demo will be the Thursday lunch meeting to the Net Works team when ready. Thomas D Gros@ENRON 12/12/2000 01:13 PM 
If you would like, the team will be prepared to show live demonstrations of the latest versions of all four CommodityLogic modules next Thursday, December 21st.  This would probably require about 2 hours.  The versions displayed will be: Financial Management Module 2.0 Financial Invoice Exchange 1.1 Confirm Central 1.0 Contract Exchange 1.0 Please let us know if you are interested in attending. All the best, Tom 
Post our exceptionally productive meeting today, I thought I would summarize where I thought we ended up, or where at least we should have ended up. Jim is going to forward the specfication for Enfibre (only Enfibre) to Philippe. Philippe will provide a team of people (from where is his choice) with no payments to be made to any other groups Philippe will provide Jim with a price (the price will include a daily rate per person) for the specific project included in the scope and not the ongoing O&M etc Jim then decides whether he wants to commence work with Net Works on this project or he adopts a different apporach. Worst case with the above approach, Jim gets the EnFibre product up and running and the rest of his projects are dealt with as and when they come along. 
Philippe spotted this too today and has asked Steve Horn to pursue.   We may want to involve Robert in this from the employment perspective. Good spot though. Thomas D Gros@ENRON 11/28/2000 05:12 PM

I understand that due to Greg not responding to your requests, Net Works has been removed from the PRC process for Analyst/Associates this year. Although I understand that reassigning people is out of the question - I would like someone present from Net Works to ensure fair representation.  I do understand that Analyts and Associates are not represented by their management but we do know that there is usually someone else from their group present in the room to offer guidance should there be any issues.

Worst case with the above approach, Jim gets the EnFibre product up and running and the rest of his projects are dealt with as and when they come along. 
Let's discuss - there were quite a few changes to be done first. The first place to demo will be the Thursday lunch meeting to the Net Works team when ready. Thomas D Gros@ENRON 12/12/2000 01:13 PM 
If you would like, the team will be prepared to show live demonstrations of the latest versions of all four CommodityLogic modules next Thursday, December 21st.  This would probably require about 2 hours.  The versions displayed will be: Financial Management Module 2.0 Financial Invoice Exchange 1.1 Confirm Central 1.0 Contract Exchange 1.0 Please let us know if you are interested in attending. All the best, Tom

Post our exceptionally productive meeting today, I thought I would summarize where I thought we ended up, or where at least we should have ended up. Jim is going to forward the specfication for Enfibre (only Enfibre) to Philippe. Philippe will provide a team of people (from where is his choice) with no payments to be made to any other groups Philippe will provide Jim with a price (the price will include a daily rate per person) for the specific project included in the scope and not the ongoing O&M etc Jim then decides whether he wants to commence work with Net Works on this project or he adopts a different apporach. Worst case with the above approach, Jim gets the EnFibre product up and running and the rest of his projects are dealt with as and when they come along. 
Philippe spotted this too today and has asked Steve Horn to pursue.   We may want to involve Robert in this from the employment perspective. Good spot though. Thomas D Gros@ENRON 11/28/2000 05:12 PM 
I raised the issue of ENW considering the purchase of a tech consulting firm at a staff meeting several weeks ago.  Attached please find a quick and dirty analysis of some of the key players.  You may note that Luminant is trading below $1.  Please let me know if anyone is actively pursuing this ""intellectual capital"" opportunity. All the best, Tom

I understand that due to Greg not responding to your requests, Net Works has been removed from the PRC process for Analyst/Associates this year. Although I understand that reassigning people is out of the question - I would like someone present from Net Works to ensure fair representation.  I do understand that Analyts and Associates are not represented by their management but we do know that there is usually someone else from their group present in the room to offer guidance should there be any issues. Let me know if you have any problems with this. Thanks Louise 
We all attended (parts of) a day long event which I believe Vince is hosting on Wharton and a project they are doing for us, I personally would like to see the results of that before doing more with Wharton as overall Vince and Jeff Shankman have Wharton pretty well covered. Louise Christie Patrick 05/21/2001 07:01 PM 
Guys-- First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance) Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton. The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level. Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research. Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives. O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about?? As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc. A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an ""Enron brain drain"" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron). The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion. ALL comments solicited---- Many thanks!! --Christie. 
Christie, Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the ""From Browsers to Buyers: Online Conversion Workshop"" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495 registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year

Frank, Thank you for the congratulations but unfortunately, I really am on maternity leave and therefore not at all up to speed on what is going on back at work.  However, Andy is available and also Philippe Bibi who is the CEO of Net Works and Greg Piper (COO) are in the office.  I am sure one of them can deal adequately with whatever issues have arisen. I will be returning at the end of June and look forward to speaking to you then. Regards Louise Kitchen COO Enron Americas 
Louise, Congrats on the new baby!  Babies are truly a miracle.  Best of luck with it.  I hope you saw all the movies that you wanted prior to delivery, because it will be years before you see the inside of a movie theatre. I know you are on maternity leave, but if you happen to get this email, please give me a call.  Unfortunately, we are headed down a path right now that could get very messy between HoustonStreet and Enron.  I want to avoid that if at all possible.  There has been a level of frustration in the communication and cooperation between our teams.  If we could both sides to cooperate and focus for a couple of days, I am confident we can iron out any issues and be prepared to go live within a week. We have a number of big players that are eagerly awaiting the launch of our link because they want to trade with Enron in a neutral, third party environment.  I also know for a fact that there are back office integration opportunities that we can pursue together that would be difficult for Enron to pursue alone. Congratulations again on your new child. Best regards, Frank 
I'll just politely respond.  I'll copy you when I get around to it. Louise 
got the email from frank. we terminated our deal last week. he is calling everyone at enron he can including whalley. call me @ 713 419 0203 if you need further details. rgds andy 
What do you want me to do with this?

I don't get anything just a few words 
You may think this sounds like an off the wall idea but Greg and I were talking about today's events and................  why don't we put our equity in eMetra on EnronOnline up for auction or even DealBench for that matter.  There is an irony with EOL though. Think about it..................  I think its a good idea.    In fact in all honesty you could put an offer out there.  Start with say $3-5 million and reduce every week you don't get an offer. The way we value this thing we could easily remove the problem in one move by just auctioning it off. There is no downside and it removes further issues you may have with future shareholders and eMetra's direction. (I personally would love to offer a certain party a log on id and password to bid.) 
I am not even going to respond to this.  As far as I am concerned its over. 
let you lock it in? Jonathan, As stated in my previous message.  The letter and your two subsequent emails confirm that Enron and eSpeed are not close to any agreement and in order to ensure no time is wasted on the part of either Enron or eSpeed, we have no further wish to pursue any further discussions.   The draft proposal we sent was not subject to negotiation. Regards Louise Kitchen COO Enron Americas

Jonathan's response and my draft response for comment.  Notice he doesn't even mention the fact he included posting!!! Jonathan, As stated in my previous message.  The letter and your email confirm that Enron and eSpeed are not close to any agreement.  The time required to further pursue this negotiation clearly outweighs any upside potential for Enron. Regards Louise Kitchen COO Enron Americas 
Louise, Please allow me to clarify a few points before you discount our proposal out of hand. In your proposal dated Feb 9, you proposed a transaction which equated to $10 million in value for Enron.  I have proposed $10 million of value 
Jonathan, Thank you for your fax dated March 13, 2001 which incorporated the letter from Fred Varacchi.  I have read the letter and had several discussions with my colleagues in London and we conclude that we have no further wish to pursue any discussions with eSpeed. The letter does not seem to correspond to any of the discussions we have had to date. I simply do not see any upside in pursuing discussions, bearing in mind that you received from us a draft proposal  which you previously indicated was satisfactory and then followed up with a letter that does not relate at all to the proposal. Regards Louise Kitchen COO Enron Americas 
FYI 
For your information. 
Peter, For your information, Enron has responded to Espeed's letter dated March 14th stating that we have ""no further wish to pursue any discussions with Espeed"". I suggest that we all fully commit our energies over the remainder of this month in pursuit of the DB/Reuters opportunity, as it represents from our perspective the only viable alternative for Emetra at this time. Tom
