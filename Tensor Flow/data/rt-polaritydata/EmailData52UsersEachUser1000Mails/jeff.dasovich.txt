Tim/Bob: Attached is the letter that we sent to Lynch explaining the info we thought ought to be made publicly available.  We're discussing how we can ensure that the market has access to any and all information that FERC might use in its ""investigation"" so that independent analyses might be undertaken.  Is there anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to Lynch (or that is already be publicly available) that FERC might use in its investigation and that we ought to target for public release?  Thanks alot. Best, Jeff 
We need to come up (very quickly) with a strategy on how to get the market information that will be important for FERC Investigation into the public arena. I keep thinking that FERC can require the information and somehow get it made public right away. 1. What information is not public that would be helpful? 2. What strategy will work to get FERC to take action? Jim

May-June, 2000 FYI.  The ISO Dept. of Market Analysis Released a rather hefty ""special report"" yesterday.  The URL is attached. Among other things, it concludes that, despite the lack of generation concentration in California, market power in times of shortage has been partially responsible for the price spikes. ""The observed market power was the combined effect of the bidding activity of in-state and out-of-state generation sources.... The high prices bid by out-of-state suppliers as well as the high prices quoted to ISO's out-of-market calls are indications of the market power of out-of-state suppliers""...[A]t high load conditions, even suppliers with less than a 9% market share can 
are being manipulated, it may not be illegal. AND Gov. Davis Calls for Cut in Electricity Bills: 
Deregulation: `Conspiracy of Incompetence' Even if energy prices are being manipulated, it may not be illegal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer STATE -- Profit-hungry power companies may be manipulating California's electricity prices, industry insiders say, but the attorney general will have a tough time finding a smoking gun in his price-fixing probe. Even if he does prove that electricity generators are ``gaming'' the market with a variety of price-influencing techniques, it's a whole other matter as to whether their actions violate the law. State legislators will attempt to shed some light on this murky matter during hearings today in Sacramento. What they will quickly discover is that power companies are having a field day as California muddles through deregulation of its electricity market. Among other things, power generators are said to be rigging electricity auctions and holding back juice until higher demand drives up wholesale prices, representing perhaps the single most glaring example of gaming, or price-fixing, the market. However, the generators aren't the only ones to blame for the current mess. ``This has literally been a conspiracy of incompetence,'' said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego grass- roots organization. ``Almost every player has made major mistakes or a series of mistakes.'' Utilities, he said, are also to blame for whopping price increases by mishandling power purchases. Meanwhile, state and federal regulators have demonstrated a virtually unwavering reluctance to weigh in and help stabilize electricity rates. At the same time, legislators themselves share some of the blame for California's energy woes by drafting rules for the deregulated market that are too easily bent, if not broken. ``All the market participants are taking advantage of very lax rules,'' said Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission. ``The market is not competitive.'' As a stopgap, Gov. Gray Davis yesterday called on the PUC to cut San Diego electricity prices in half over the next two years, although he was vague on how this can be accomplished. 1996 DEREGULATION When electricity deregulation was approved in 1996, the goal was to lower prices by boosting competition. In practice, however, only about a half-dozen power generators are now responsible for as much as three-quarters of the state's energy supply, and they can set prices pretty much as they see fit. Officials at the California Power Exchange, the wholesale market where power companies sell their juice and utilities go shopping, insist that they closely monitor all transactions. But they admit that it is impossible to know what may transpire among generators off the trading floor. ``There are hundreds of ways that somebody could do it,'' exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo said of whether price-fixing is possible. ``You could argue that it happens every day. ``But I don't see how you could call this gaming,'' he said. ``You call it business.'' There's the rub. Although residents of San Diego, the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation, have seen average power bills more than double over the past three months, power generators say this is simply a result of supply and demand. SUPPLY LIMITED, DEMAND RISING With supply severely limited -- no major power plants have been built in the state in a decade -- and demand rapidly rising, it is only natural, they say, that electricity prices would go through the roof. ``It's a feast-or-famine business,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of Menlo Park's Western Power Trading Forum, an energy industry group. ``You make a lot of money when times are good, and lose a lot of money when times are bad.'' At the moment, times are very good for power generators. An unusually hot summer has combined with a booming, tech-fueled economy to push California's power grid nearly to the breaking point on an almost daily basis. The question is: Are power companies benefiting from what are, for them, lucky circumstances, or are they making a bad situation even worse with practices that may not be illegal but still could be viewed as highly irresponsible? FOUR WHOLESALE MARKETS There are four major wholesale markets for electricity in California. The biggest is called the daily forward market, where generators and utilities meet each morning to buy and sell power on an hour-by-hour basis covering the next 24 hours. Electricity at times of expected low demand, such as 1 a.m., might go for as little as $25 per megawatt, while electricity during peak demand -- 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. -- often sells for the maximum allowable amount, or $250 per megawatt. Longer-term contracts are negotiated on what is called the block forward market, where prices are more stable. But, industry sources say, power companies are increasingly focusing more on the hourly and real-time markets, where the potential for profit is greater than on the daily forward market because buyers have less room to maneuver -- they have to meet immediate demand. ``Of course people are gaming the market,'' said Dan Richard, senior vice president of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. ``They know when to make bids and how to get what they want. Is that illegal? I honestly don't know.'' Brian Rahman, who oversees the real-time wholesale market on behalf of the California Independent System Operator, agreed that the legality of such moves has yet to be determined. ``The power marketers know our rules,'' he said, ``and they use them to their benefit.'' Even so, Power Exchange officials said they will tell legislators today that their own study of wholesale electricity prices shows that California rates in June and July were in fact lower than in other states. ``This makes it harder to make a case that market power is being exerted by power generators,'' said the exchange's Arredondo. ``It's exceedingly difficult to prove that there's market power.'' NO HEDGING IN SAN DIEGO Meanwhile, San Diego Gas & Electric has been accused of adding to electricity price volatility in the Southern California city by not securing long-term contracts for energy at a steady rate -- a process known as ``hedging.'' Instead, the utility exposed its customers to daily price spikes, which resulted in power bills surging skyward. ``San Diego is bearing the brunt (of deregulation) for a couple of reasons: poor hedging and poor hedging,'' Arredondo said. For its part, PG&E has said it learned its lesson from San Diego and will make active use of hedging when its customers face the impact of deregulation, perhaps as soon as next summer. Davis called last week for Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate ``possible manipulation'' in the wholesale electricity market. He also has asked federal regulators to rule that California's energy market is not competitive and to mandate ``just and reasonable'' rates. But regulators at both the federal and state levels so far have been reluctant to act, preferring instead to allow deregulation to run its course. For all these reasons, California's energy market has been especially vulnerable to exploitation by those who may not have consumers' best interests at heart. ``The system of responsibility is fragmented,'' the PUC's Lynch said, ``and because it is fragmented, it allows various players to game the market.'' WHAT CAN BE DONE The solution? It depends who you ask. Most of those on the energy playing field believe that some degree of regulation is necessary to stabilize electricity prices, but no one yet knows how far legislators should go in drafting revised rules. Increased generating capacity will go a long way toward solving California's problems, but it will be years before enough new plants come online to bring supply and demand into balance. Today's hearings in Sacramento will presumably lay the groundwork for future initiatives. Although few if anyone knows how to fix things, everyone at least agrees that something -- anything -- needs to be done. ``Government messes things up a lot of times, and the private sector messes things up a lot of times,'' said PG&E's Richard. ``But in the end, solutions emerge because it's just too important. That's the case now.''

Gray Davis yesterday called on the California Public Utilities Commission to cut soaring San Diego electricity bills in half during the next two years. However, it was not clear how he expects the PUC to accomplish this goal or whether the commission will even heed the governor's request. Davis does not have the authority to order the PUC to act. ``This is not a rate freeze,'' Davis told reporters in Sacramento. ``It is a rate-stabilization plan.'' It appears that what he has in mind is having San Diego Gas & Electric, the local utility, level out power bills by spreading its wholesale costs over longer periods. This would reduce customers' bills in the summer but raise bills at other times of the year. ``This is an oraclelike document,'' Michael Shames, executive director of San Diego's Utility Consumers' Action Network, said after reading a press release outlining the governor's position. ``You can read almost anything into it.'' Calling electricity prices in San Diego exorbitant, Davis said he wants the PUC to reduce average residential power bills from the current level of about $120 a month to approximately $65. ``Electricity is the pulse of our economy,'' he said. ``Without it, consumers and businesses are put at risk. California simply cannot afford any more price spikes or blackouts.'' Carl Wood, a Davis appointee on the PUC, said he believes the governor is seeking a so-called level pricing program for SDG&E customers. The PUC is empowered to order the utility to implement such a program. The utility itself already is urging ratepayers to adopt a similar pricing plan, thereby paying consistent electricity fees throughout the year. ``We can't make the prices go away, but we can set up a system where the prices are level and deferred,'' Wood said. PUC President Loretta Lynch said she will call a special meeting of the commission for August 21 to discuss the governor's proposal. Davis' comments came ahead of a joint hearing today at 10 a.m. on California's energy woes by the Senate and Assembly utilities committees in the Capitol Building. Also today, state Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado (San Diego County), and Assemblywoman Susan Davis, D-Kensington, are expected to introduce identical bills seeking to roll back electricity rates in San Diego to prederegulation levels. ``We appreciate what the governor has done, but we feel there needs to be a parallel track in the Legislature where we find a solution for San Diego ratepayers,'' Alpert said. The governor said he will contact President Clinton and James Hoecker, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to urge them to expedite an investigation of California's wholesale electricity market. He also has called on Attorney General Bill Lockyer to probe suspected price fixing by power generators. ``I believe in making a profit,'' Davis said. ``I believe in success. But charging seven, eight, nine times the price you pay for electricity is simply unconscionable. It's not fair to California. It will bring down our economy, and it augers very poorly for America.'' Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy said it may sail to the rescue in San Diego by bringing in its own electricity- generating equipment to keep its extensive bases in the area humming. The Navy is SDG&E's single biggest customer, drawing about 3 percent of the utility's total output. The Navy said in a statement that it is looking into transporting 10 750-kilowatt generators from its facility in Port Heuneme to San Diego. For its part, the California Grocers Association said its members will reduce electricity usage by 10 percent during periods of unusually heavy demand. This could include lowering store lighting and cutting air conditioning at some supermarkets. ``Although consumers may notice some differences while in their local supermarket, the energy-saving measures will not affect normal store operations,'' said Peter Larkin, president of the association. ``Also, none

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL / CALIFORNIA Critics Seek More Control Over ISO By Marc Lifsher 08/09/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page CA1 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Some people want the California Independent System Operator to be a lot less independent. The Folsom-based nonprofit corporation, which acts as the traffic cop for the state's electricity grid, has been a lightning rod for criticism during this summer's power crisis. Though generally praised for keeping lights on in the face of severe shortages of electricity, the ISO has come under fire for failing to move more quickly to lower the maximum price it will pay generators for emergency power to meet demand and prevent blackouts. Pressure on the ISO has eased considerably since last week, when its governing board voted to lower the cap on such same-day, emergency purchases -- the only type of pricing it has the power to affect directly -- to $250 a megawatt hour from $500. But the heat hasn't been turned off completely. Some lawmakers still are calling for changes in the 26-member ISO board, which includes people nominated by power generators, utilities, middlemen, and commercial and residential customers, among others. The critics want to streamline the board and make it more accountable to the state's elected officials. The ISO was created by the state's 1996 utility-deregulation act to transmit electricity smoothly between generators and utilities. Lawmakers devised the independent board as a way to give the various ""stakeholders"" -- generators, utilities, middlemen, customers and environmentalists -- a say in how energy is supplied. Members serve for up to three years. ""It's inappropriate for the ISO governing board to vote on issues that benefit them financially,"" says Sen. Dede Alpert, a Coronado Democrat. She questions the wisdom of allowing out-of-state energy sellers and marketers to sit on the ISO board and vote on emergency prices, especially when they have an interest in keeping those prices high. Sen. Alpert spent much of the Legislature's recent summer recess fielding complaints about high electricity costs from her constituents, customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Last summer, SDG&E became the first investor-owned utility in the state to have price regulations fully lifted. This summer, its rates have doubled, as high temperatures and power shortages have swept the West. In response to a series of price spikes in Southern California and the wider contention that skyrocketing prices indicate the failure of deregulation, state lawmakers have scheduled a joint hearing tomorrow in Sacramento. High on the agenda: possible changes in the ISO's governing structure and scrutiny of the way it handles power statewide on hot days. Critics say emergency purchases should be no more than 5% of electric-power sales, but were as high as 33% of the market on hot days earlier this summer. Key legislative leaders -- including Sen. Steve Peace, an El Cajon Democrat who was the architect of the 1996 deregulation law -- would like to make the ISO more accountable to state elected officials. Possible changes include preventing industry representatives with conflicts from sitting on the ISO board, as well as abolishing the ISO entirely and shifting its responsibilities back to state utilities, under the supervision of the state Public Utilities Commission. Until 1996, the PUC regulated all electric utility rates and services. ISO board members say legislative critics are unfairly focusing anger over the price spikes on the ISO, which has only a limited ability to set prices. Most electricity isn't sold through the same-day, emergency market -- but through long-term contracts between sellers and utilities, or at least a day in advance through the California Power Exchange, which is a nonprofit corporation established by the 1996 law to serve as a trading floor. ""We need to create a government structure that is not susceptible to pressure from one state senator or anyone else,"" to keep prices artificially low, says ISO Chairman Jan Smutney-Jones, who represents the Independent Energy Producers Association, the trade group for non-utility power generators. He dismisses criticism of the board's out-of-state members. There needs to be ""an independent, interstate board"" because energy is transmitted across state lines, he says. Two Houston-based power sellers on the board, Dynegy Corp. and Enron Corp., deny any conflict. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, blames state officials for expanding the ISO's role to include monitoring prices. ""If there's any finger-pointing,"" Mr. Watson says, ""they

In response to a series of price spikes in Southern California and the wider contention that skyrocketing prices indicate the failure of deregulation, state lawmakers have scheduled a joint hearing tomorrow in Sacramento. High on the agenda: possible changes in the ISO's governing structure and scrutiny of the way it handles power statewide on hot days. Critics say emergency purchases should be no more than 5% of electric-power sales, but were as high as 33% of the market on hot days earlier this summer. Key legislative leaders -- including Sen. Steve Peace, an El Cajon Democrat who was the architect of the 1996 deregulation law -- would like to make the ISO more accountable to state elected officials. Possible changes include preventing industry representatives with conflicts from sitting on the ISO board, as well as abolishing the ISO entirely and shifting its responsibilities back to state utilities, under the supervision of the state Public Utilities Commission. Until 1996, the PUC regulated all electric utility rates and services. ISO board members say legislative critics are unfairly focusing anger over the price spikes on the ISO, which has only a limited ability to set prices. Most electricity isn't sold through the same-day, emergency market -- but through long-term contracts between sellers and utilities, or at least a day in advance through the California Power Exchange, which is a nonprofit corporation established by the 1996 law to serve as a trading floor. ""We need to create a government structure that is not susceptible to pressure from one state senator or anyone else,"" to keep prices artificially low, says ISO Chairman Jan Smutney-Jones, who represents the Independent Energy Producers Association, the trade group for non-utility power generators. He dismisses criticism of the board's out-of-state members. There needs to be ""an independent, interstate board"" because energy is transmitted across state lines, he says. Two Houston-based power sellers on the board, Dynegy Corp. and Enron Corp., deny any conflict. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, blames state officials for expanding the ISO's role to include monitoring prices. ""If there's any finger-pointing,"" Mr. Watson says, ""they 
Tim/Bob: Attached is the letter that we sent to Lynch explaining the info we thought ought to be made publicly available.  We're discussing how we can ensure that the market has access to any and all information that FERC might use in its ""investigation"" so that independent analyses might be undertaken.  Is there anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to Lynch (or that is already be publicly available) that FERC might use in its investigation and that we ought to target for public release?  Thanks alot. Best, Jeff 
We need to come up (very quickly) with a strategy on how to get the market information that will be important for FERC Investigation into the public arena. I keep thinking that FERC can require the information and somehow get it made public right away. 1. What information is not public that would be helpful? 2. What strategy will work to get FERC to take action? Jim

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL / CALIFORNIA Critics Seek More Control Over ISO By Marc Lifsher 08/09/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page CA1 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Some people want the California Independent System Operator to be a lot less independent. The Folsom-based nonprofit corporation, which acts as the traffic cop for the state's electricity grid, has been a lightning rod for criticism during this summer's power crisis. Though generally praised for keeping lights on in the face of severe shortages of electricity, the ISO has come under fire for failing to move more quickly to lower the maximum price it will pay generators for emergency power to meet demand and prevent blackouts. Pressure on the ISO has eased considerably since last week, when its governing board voted to lower the cap on such same-day, emergency purchases -- the only type of pricing it has the power to affect directly -- to $250 a megawatt hour from $500. But the heat hasn't been turned off completely. Some lawmakers still are calling for changes in the 26-member ISO board, which includes people nominated by power generators, utilities, middlemen, and commercial and residential customers, among others. The critics want to streamline the board and make it more accountable to the state's elected officials. The ISO was created by the state's 1996 utility-deregulation act to transmit electricity smoothly between generators and utilities. Lawmakers devised the independent board as a way to give the various ""stakeholders"" -- generators, utilities, middlemen, customers and environmentalists -- a say in how energy is supplied. Members serve for up to three years. ""It's inappropriate for the ISO governing board to vote on issues that benefit them financially,"" says Sen. Dede Alpert, a Coronado Democrat. She questions the wisdom of allowing out-of-state energy sellers and marketers to sit on the ISO board and vote on emergency prices, especially when they have an interest in keeping those prices high. Sen. Alpert spent much of the Legislature's recent summer recess fielding complaints about high electricity costs from her constituents, customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Last summer, SDG&E became the first investor-owned utility in the state to have price regulations fully lifted. This summer, its rates have doubled, as high temperatures and power shortages have swept the West. In response to a series of price spikes in Southern California and the wider contention that skyrocketing prices indicate the failure of deregulation, state lawmakers have scheduled a joint hearing tomorrow in Sacramento.

are being manipulated, it may not be illegal. AND Gov. Davis Calls for Cut in Electricity Bills: 
Deregulation: `Conspiracy of Incompetence' Even if energy prices are being manipulated, it may not be illegal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer STATE -- Profit-hungry power companies may be manipulating California's electricity prices, industry insiders say, but the attorney general will have a tough time finding a smoking gun in his price-fixing probe. Even if he does prove that electricity generators are ``gaming'' the market with a variety of price-influencing techniques, it's a whole other matter as to whether their actions violate the law. State legislators will attempt to shed some light on this murky matter during hearings today in Sacramento. What they will quickly discover is that power companies are having a field day as California muddles through deregulation of its electricity market. Among other things, power generators are said to be rigging electricity auctions and holding back juice until higher demand drives up wholesale prices, representing perhaps the single most glaring example of gaming, or price-fixing, the market. However, the generators aren't the only ones to blame for the current mess. ``This has literally been a conspiracy of incompetence,'' said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego grass- roots organization. ``Almost every player has made major mistakes or a series of mistakes.'' Utilities, he said, are also to blame for whopping price increases by mishandling power purchases. Meanwhile, state and federal regulators have demonstrated a virtually unwavering reluctance to weigh in and help stabilize electricity rates. At the same time, legislators themselves share some of the blame for California's energy woes by drafting rules for the deregulated market that are too easily bent, if not broken. ``All the market participants are taking advantage of very lax rules,'' said Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission. ``The market is not competitive.'' As a stopgap, Gov. Gray Davis yesterday called on the PUC to cut San Diego electricity prices in half over the next two years, although he was vague on how this can be accomplished. 1996 DEREGULATION When electricity deregulation was approved in 1996, the goal was to lower prices by boosting competition. In practice, however, only about a half-dozen power generators are now responsible for as much as three-quarters of the state's energy supply, and they can set prices pretty much as they see fit. Officials at the California Power Exchange, the wholesale market where power companies sell their juice and utilities go shopping, insist that they closely monitor all transactions. But they admit that it is impossible to know what may transpire among generators off the trading floor. ``There are hundreds of ways that somebody could do it,'' exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo said of whether price-fixing is possible. ``You could argue that it happens every day. ``But I don't see how you could call this gaming,'' he said. ``You call it business.'' There's the rub. Although residents of San Diego, the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation, have seen average power bills more than double over the past three months, power generators say this is simply a result of supply and demand. SUPPLY LIMITED, DEMAND RISING With supply severely limited -- no major power plants have been built in the state in a decade -- and demand rapidly rising, it is only natural, they say, that electricity prices would go through the roof. ``It's a feast-or-famine business,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of Menlo Park's Western Power Trading Forum, an energy industry group. ``You make a lot of money when times are good, and lose a lot of money when times are bad.'' At the moment, times are very good for power generators. An unusually hot summer has combined with a booming, tech-fueled economy to push California's power grid nearly to the breaking point on an almost daily basis. The question is: Are power companies benefiting from what are, for them, lucky circumstances, or are they making a bad situation even worse with practices that may not be illegal but still could be viewed as highly irresponsible? FOUR WHOLESALE MARKETS There are four major wholesale markets for electricity in California. The biggest is called the daily forward market, where generators and utilities meet each morning to buy and sell power on an hour-by-hour basis covering the next 24 hours. Electricity at times of expected low demand, such as 1 a.m., might go for as little as $25 per megawatt, while electricity during peak demand -- 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. -- often sells for the maximum allowable amount, or $250 per megawatt. Longer-term contracts are negotiated on what is called the block forward market, where prices are more stable. But, industry sources say, power companies are increasingly focusing more on the hourly and real-time markets, where the potential for profit is greater than on the daily forward market because buyers have less room to maneuver -- they have to meet immediate demand. ``Of course people are gaming the market,'' said Dan Richard, senior vice president of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. ``They know when to make bids and how to get what they want. Is that illegal? I honestly don't know.'' Brian Rahman, who oversees the real-time wholesale market on behalf of the California Independent System Operator, agreed that the legality of such moves has yet to be determined. ``The power marketers know our rules,'' he said, ``and they use them to their benefit.'' Even so, Power Exchange officials said they will tell legislators today that their own study of wholesale electricity prices shows that California rates in June and July were in fact lower than in other states. ``This makes it harder to make a case that market power is being exerted by power generators,'' said the exchange's Arredondo. ``It's exceedingly difficult to prove that there's market power.'' NO HEDGING IN SAN DIEGO Meanwhile, San Diego Gas & Electric has been accused of adding to electricity price volatility in the Southern California city by not securing long-term contracts for energy at a steady rate -- a process known as ``hedging.'' Instead, the utility exposed its customers to daily price spikes, which resulted in power bills surging skyward. ``San Diego is bearing the brunt (of deregulation) for a couple of reasons: poor hedging and poor hedging,'' Arredondo said. For its part, PG&E has said it learned its lesson from San Diego and will make active use of hedging when its customers face the impact of deregulation, perhaps as soon as next summer. Davis called last week for Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate ``possible manipulation'' in the wholesale electricity market. He also has asked federal regulators to rule that California's energy market is not competitive and to mandate ``just and reasonable'' rates. But regulators at both the federal and state levels so far have been reluctant to act, preferring instead to allow deregulation to run its course. For all these reasons, California's energy market has been especially vulnerable to exploitation by those who may not have consumers' best interests at heart. ``The system of responsibility is fragmented,'' the PUC's Lynch said, ``and because it is fragmented, it allows various players to game the market.'' WHAT CAN BE DONE The solution? It depends who you ask. Most of those on the energy playing field believe that some degree of regulation is necessary to stabilize electricity prices, but no one yet knows how far legislators should go in drafting revised rules. Increased generating capacity will go a long way toward solving California's problems, but it will be years before enough new plants come online to bring supply and demand into balance. Today's hearings in Sacramento will presumably lay the groundwork for future initiatives. Although few if anyone knows how to fix things, everyone at least agrees that something -- anything -- needs to be done. ``Government messes things up a lot of times, and the private sector messes things up a lot of times,'' said PG&E's Richard. ``But in the end, solutions emerge because it's just too important. That's the case now.''

Davis Calls for Cut in Electricity Bills PUC under no obligation to heed unclear request David Lazarus, Lynda Gledhill, Greg Lucas, Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday, August 10, 2000 ,2000 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/08/10/B U99453.DTL&type=business Gov. Gray Davis yesterday called on the California Public Utilities Commission to cut soaring San Diego electricity bills in half during the next two years. However, it was not clear how he expects the PUC to accomplish this goal or whether the commission will even heed the governor's request. Davis does not have the authority to order the PUC to act. ``This is not a rate freeze,'' Davis told reporters in Sacramento. ``It is a rate-stabilization plan.'' It appears that what he has in mind is having San Diego Gas & Electric, the local utility, level out power bills by spreading its wholesale costs over longer periods. This would reduce customers' bills in the summer but raise bills at other times of the year. ``This is an oraclelike document,'' Michael Shames, executive director of San Diego's Utility Consumers' Action Network, said after reading a press release outlining the governor's position. ``You can read almost anything into it.'' Calling electricity prices in San Diego exorbitant, Davis said he wants the PUC to reduce average residential power bills from the current level of about $120 a month to approximately $65. ``Electricity is the pulse of our economy,'' he said. ``Without it, consumers and businesses are put at risk. California simply cannot afford any more price spikes or blackouts.'' Carl Wood, a Davis appointee on the PUC, said he believes the governor is seeking a so-called level pricing program for SDG&E customers. The PUC is empowered to order the utility to implement such a program. The utility itself already is urging ratepayers to adopt a similar pricing plan, thereby paying consistent electricity fees throughout the year. ``We can't make the prices go away, but we can set up a system where the prices are level and deferred,'' Wood said. PUC President Loretta Lynch said she will call a special meeting of the commission for August 21 to discuss the governor's proposal. Davis' comments came ahead of a joint hearing today at 10 a.m. on California's energy woes by the Senate and Assembly utilities committees in the Capitol Building. Also today, state Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado (San Diego County), and Assemblywoman Susan Davis, D-Kensington, are expected to introduce identical bills seeking to roll back electricity rates in San Diego to prederegulation levels. ``We appreciate what the governor has done, but we feel there needs to be a parallel track in the Legislature where we find a solution for San Diego ratepayers,'' Alpert said. The governor said he will contact President Clinton and James Hoecker, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to urge them to expedite an investigation of California's wholesale electricity market. He also has called on Attorney General Bill Lockyer to probe suspected price fixing by power generators. ``I believe in making a profit,'' Davis said. ``I believe in success. But charging seven, eight, nine times the price you pay for electricity is simply unconscionable. It's not fair to California. It will bring down our economy, and it augers very poorly for America.'' Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy said it may sail to the rescue in San Diego by bringing in its own electricity- generating equipment to keep its extensive bases in the area humming. The Navy is SDG&E's single biggest customer, drawing about 3 percent of the utility's total output. The Navy said in a statement that it is looking into transporting 10 750-kilowatt generators from its facility in Port Heuneme to San Diego. For its part, the California Grocers Association said its members will reduce electricity usage by 10 percent during periods of unusually heavy demand. This could include lowering store lighting and cutting air conditioning at some supermarkets. ``Although consumers may notice some differences while in their local supermarket, the energy-saving measures will not affect normal store operations,'' said Peter Larkin, president of the association. ``Also, none

""The observed market power was the combined effect of the bidding activity of in-state and out-of-state generation sources....

Industry Outlook 
Nokia Expects to Meet Earnings Forecast Despite Lowered Sales, Industry Outlook Dow Jones Newswires HELSINKI, Finland -- Despite market conditions that have cut into its sales growth, Nokia Corp. said Thursday that it expects to meet its earnings target for the first quarter of 2001, thanks to better-than-anticipated profit margins. Nokia estimates it is likely to earn 19 European cents a share in the first quarter, in line with estimates it provided in January. Nokia's shares received a boost from the statement, rising 2.60 euros, or 11%, to 27.15 euros in early-afternoon trading in Helsinki. In midday trading in the U.S., shares of Nokia were up $3.20, or 15%, to $25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said it expects year-on-year sales growth in its networks division during the first quarter to be 30% to 35%, and 15% to 20% in the mobile-handsets division. Total sales growth is expected to be around 20%, the company said. That is lower than the 25% to 30% sales growth the company forecast in January, when it released full-year results for 2000. The company said it has had to confront ""difficult market conditions,"" particularly in the U.S. ""We feel confident about our strengths and our performance during the early months of the year,"" Nokia Chairman and Chief Executive Jorma Ollila said. ""Despite the more difficult market conditions, we have been able to show good progress. We expect to see solid growth for the first quarter as a whole,

Greetings: Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two different utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained that the situation would be resolved. The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a couple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot of large (""noncore"") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff in the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.  The Commission is now concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service. Today, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to respond to the following: Have you ""stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing natural gas commodity procurement contract.  If your company has stopped or intends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate the natural gas volumes involved the location of the non-core customer(s) the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those 
If there is going to be a play come the first of the year to meld California's PX and ISO, Skilling may want to consider pre-empting that agenda (and most of this is not new; already included in previous messaging points we've developed internally): It's the gas industry, stupid---for profit transcos is the answer. California's big mistake was replacing one monopoly--the utility---with another--the PX.  PX's are not necessarily bad things.  But PXs with a monopoly is a very bad thing. Forcing the IOUS to buy everything from the PX was irresponsible. ""Put everyone on a variable rate mortgage"" story. Decision makers openly admitted that they put in place a strucuture designed NOT to encourage retail choice and competition. Decision makers actively urged families and businesses NOT to switch to providers offering an ""insurance policy"" (i.e., fixed price deals) against the volatile and risky power exchange price. When you combine the supply shortage, the PX monopoly, the nonexistant retail market and decision makers' attempts to discourage choice, you get a debacle--that's what California set itself up for, and that's what it got. Putting the PX inside the ISO will only infect the wound that's already been inflicted. The real answer is....(we've developed these points already). This is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate, but wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints. Best,

bullish on Enron broadband unit ... USA: Analysts still bullish on Enron broadband unit prospects. By C. Bryson Hull 03/15/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. HOUSTON, March 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street took a hard look at Enron Corp.'s content delivery plans this week after it ended its video-on-demand deal with Blockbuster Inc. , but remained largely unfazed by the failure of the flagship deal, analysts said on Thursday. On balance, most analysts viewed the busted 20-year exclusive agreement as disappointing, but by no means a fatal blow to Enron Broadband Services' (EBS) budding content delivery segment. Most reiterated buy or strong buy ratings for the Houston company and maintained bullish earnings targets for the Enron Broadband Services division. But all are awaiting an indication of how Enron will reconfigure the content delivery initiative. ""I think Blockbuster represented kind of an anchor tenant for the broadband business, so they have lost a contract that was important,"" said Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Houston investment house Simmons and Co. Now EBS will have to pursue smaller contracts to make up the loss, which could mean a longer road to create as big a book of business, Dietert said. EBS executives have said they expect to have $1 billion in total contracted business by the end of 2001. CHASING MORE CONTRACTS TO FILL VOID EBS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Rice on Friday said his division is already pursuing deals with content providers to send on-demand games, movies, music and television over the Enron network. UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, in a research note released Monday, said he still believes Enron will hit the $1 billion mark in 2001. ""Though this announcement is clearly a disappointment we have a great deal of confidence in the judgment of Enron's senior management and of the upside associated with this business,"" Barone wrote. His report reiterated a strong buy recommendation and 12-month stock price target of $102 a share, with EBS accounting for $25 of that. One analyst remained skeptical of the content delivery plans. ""Where they go from here is one of things they have to tell the market in a convincing fashion,"" said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who raised Enron to accumulate from hold on Thursday. But he also cut earnings targets for the EBS segment to $8.40/share because of the failed Blockbuster deal. Heady cash-flow projections figured heavily in Enron's guidance for 2001, which called for a stock price of $126, of which EBS would account for $40, Meade said. Meade, whose company initiated coverage on Enron in late May 2000, had been alone among Enron analysts in keeping a hold rating on the stock. Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey on Monday released a note reiterating his buy recommendation with a $99/share price target. ""While the separation from such a high-profile name is disappointing, we do not view this as negative,"" Eassey wrote. ""This could in fact actually

Good Morning Jeff, Catherine is out of the office until Tuesday 3/20/01.  Not wanting to keep you waiting for a reply, I thought it best to give you some feedback immediately. The great majority of CAD's customers in CA are core.  CAD does not knowingly terminate any current customer prior to their expiration date. The reasons why CAD's customers are turned back to the utility are as follows: 1) Upon receiving renewal pricing from the CAD rep,  the customer chooses to return to the utility. 2) Understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers is approximately $300, those customers that have extremely low annual volumes are sent attrition letters and turned back to the LDC, at the end of their contract.  We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the utility, and extract enough margin to support them. Currently in the California markets (PG&E, SDG&E, & SOCAL) , there exists approximately 50 customers that have usages so low that given current market conditions, we will not choose to renew the contracts.  The expiration dates for these are between 5/30/2001 and 2/28/2005. 3) The customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their contractual expiration date.  As we are all aware, California customers, specifically those with either an index or NYMEX product, experienced a large swing in their pricing during the past few months.  CAD has been inundated with customers requesting to be returned to their LDC.  Although we seek to satisfy our customer to the best of our ability,  returning these customers to the utility is the LAST thing we want to do!!!!!!! The steps we have taken to address this issue is to: a) work with customer service/credit to offer extended payment options to ease the effect of the increase. b) offer to restructure the customer's contract, and reprice the customer on a fixed price product; minimizing their risk going forward. c) explain to the customer, in more detail, the reasons why this has occurred, and how, going forward, the index/NYMEX pricing has eased. Should you have additional questions, please reply or call. -Jim Sent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON

The Commission is now concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.

Paul, Sue and Joseph - I wanted to give you all a quick update on the Mike Day invoices.  I have the invoice for January and understand from Joseph that he has the invoice for the special session which once reviewed, coded and approved Joseph will overnight to Houston.  I called Larry Dallman in accounting and Larry confirmed that Goodin, MacBride is currently on a Net 7 payment term.  Larry said that he could expedite payment for the January and special session invoices for same day pay.  Accounting will call me when the checks are ready to be picked up and I will fed ex payment to Mr. Day's attention once I have the checks.  Larry and I agreed that it would be best to wait to send the invoices at one time (this will make it easier for accounting). Paul - As you and I discussed, I will send an email to Mr. Day once I have received the invoices to advise him when to expect payment and I will confirm that he should be the recipient once I have the checks.  I'll make sure to copy you, Sue and Joseph so we all stay on the same page. Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns. Eric 713-853-1711

Good Morning Jeff, Catherine is out of the office until Tuesday 3/20/01.  Not wanting to keep you waiting for a reply, I thought it best to give you some feedback immediately. The great majority of CAD's customers in CA are core.  CAD does not knowingly terminate any current customer prior to their expiration date. The reasons why CAD's customers are turned back to the utility are as follows: 1) Upon receiving renewal pricing from the CAD rep,  the customer chooses to return to the utility. 2) Understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers is approximately $300, those customers that have extremely low annual volumes are sent attrition letters and turned back to the LDC, at the end of their contract.  We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the utility, and extract enough margin to support them. Currently in the California markets (PG&E, SDG&E, & SOCAL) , there exists approximately 50 customers that have usages so low that given current market conditions, we will not choose to renew the contracts.  The expiration dates for these are between 5/30/2001 and 2/28/2005. 3) The customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their contractual expiration date.  As we are all aware, California customers, specifically those with either an index or NYMEX product, experienced a large swing in their pricing during the past few months.  CAD has been inundated with customers requesting to be returned to their LDC.  Although we seek to satisfy our customer to the best of our ability,  returning these customers to the utility is the LAST thing we want to do!!!!!!! The steps we have taken to address this issue is to: a) work with customer service/credit to offer extended payment options to ease the effect of the increase. b) offer to restructure the customer's contract, and reprice the customer on a fixed price product; minimizing their risk going forward. c) explain to the customer, in more detail, the reasons why this has occurred, and how, going forward, the index/NYMEX pricing has eased. Should you have additional questions, please reply or call. -Jim Sent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON 
Greetings: Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two different utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained that the situation would be resolved. The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a couple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot of large (""noncore"") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff in the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.

Thanks very much for your help. Best, 
Great points.  Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity. That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this ""study"" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it. I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose:  to influence the policy decision currently under debate ""To de-regulate or not.""  As such, I wouldn't see issues like ""PJM or APX"" or ""competitive default supplier or not,"" or ""divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets"" being the focus. That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in ""Round 2,"" once the initial debate over ""deregulate or not"" is won. To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, ""right"" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably.  And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment.  In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating  implementation may be moot.  Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on ""how to do it,"" but that would not be the emphasis. In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of ""to deregulate or not,"" and address implementation in a second, or follow up, study.  I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly, since the ""go/no go"" decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue. Best, Jeff James D Steffes 03/16/2001 08:22 AM 
choice Jeff -- It would be helpful to get some feedback prior to starting to deal with the fundamental question related to direct access for smaller customers.  I would like to know Teece's perspective on the role of government in this marketplace.  In addition, I think that the paper must deal with the drawbacks of having mixed roles - utility default supply and competitive markets. Jim Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 03/15/2001 03:11 PM 
choice Greetings: As I've mentioned, I've been discussing with a group of academics (principally from UC Berkeley) the possibility of producing an analysis of why it makes sense to move forward toward de-regulation, and makes no sense to turn back to command-and-control regulation.  Clearly, we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward, or go back. I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group.  It's attached.  Please take a look.  I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read.  Few points worth mentioning: The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with LECG, Inc., the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron. List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ. The list also includes Hogan and Joskow  and Borenstein.  We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis. However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., ""de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work.""  Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the ""authors"" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course.  The analysis would not be a debate over ""To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc.""  In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a ""Nixon goes to China"" scenario.  Please take a look at the list of participants.  Again, we can add to and subtract from the list. Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG.) None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum.  It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan). The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project.  This is for two reasons:  1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study. If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. nationwide to garner support for the project. Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile.  Appreciate your comments. Best, Jeff

Look at this.  Baum finally speaks up  -- way too late. Can somebody tell me what SDG&E's energy rate was pre-dereg? 
The Distributed Energy Resources industry won a major battle yesterday.  The California Senate Energy and Utilities Committee passed on a 7-0 bipartisan vote, Sen. Morrow's (and while her name wasn't on this bill, it was as much Sen. Alpert's) bill on eliminating any tariff that discriminates against DER.  SBX 9 was derived from the omnibus DER bill SBX 35 which is still alive and contains many important provisions fro removing additional barriers. Yesterday's vote represents a major win because even if the bill ultimately does not get enacted, a very important statement has been made by the committee.  I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their proceedings. The DER community owes much thanks to Sen.'s Morrow and Alpert, and the Utilities Committee Members and their staffs: Sen. Bowen (Chair) Sen. Alarcon Sen. Battin Sen. Dunn Sen. Murray Sen. Poochigian Sen. Sher Sen. Speier Sen. Vasconcellos Sen. Vincent Also much thanks to everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on this effort.  From the business, consumer advocacy, environmental, government, manufacturing, and real estate communities. Here are the highlights of yesterday's actions: 1. For IOU's- No discriminatory tariffs for new DER installed between May 1, 2000 and June 1, 2003 if DER is in combined heat and power mode.  If you have a peaking unit with gen only, then you have until  July 1 2001, to get it installed. 2. DER installed within the window gets the exemption until June 1, 2011. 3. The maximum capacity of the DER is 5 MW in aggregate per site. 4. The DER must have emissions levels of 9 PPM or better until the ARB established new guidelines and standards, expected late this year or early next year. 5. Customers with DER are still required to pay interconnection, public purpose charges, and obligations incurred under the Dept. of Water Resources energy purchases program. 6. The CPUC shall require the electrical corporations to include non-utility owned DER in its planning process. 7. The CPUC is required to establish a firewall so that in the event that the implementation of DER results in net costs to the system, those costs stay within the customer class. 8. The CPUC shall require the utilities to establish new rates for DER that are non-discriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the costs. 9. Muni's are required to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold public meetings to solicit comment for recommended changes. Now we have momentum, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do on the Assembly side and with Governor's office.  We need the continued (increased) support of all of you as we move this forward. Steven A.

Greetings: UCAN and Ratepayers have filed a Request for Hearings regarding the actions of certain generation companies in connection with alleged manipulation of California's electricity markets by five pivotal market players.During an informal discussion with another party a question arose about whether the request for hearings included an examination of actions taken by SDG&E, PG&E or Southern California Edison in pursuing claims against alleged market manipulators.  This filing is meant to clarify that UCAN and Ratepayers are not at this time requesting hearings into the actions of SDG& E, PG&E or Southern California Edison in pursuing any such claims they may enjoy.  The requested hearings are proposed to focus on the whether the five pivotal market players had the ability to exercise significant market power so that operation of the new market institutions was distorted.

day over Davis' requests 
State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom Hannigan. To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much California is spending on power purchases. Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw it. ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- Redding. Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in Davis' proposed budget. Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans to rise. ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look

The Commission has the ability to extend through 2003.  The Commission also has the ability to adjust the cap. Commission can use revenues from utility-owned assets, refunds from FERC to offset the undercollections.  (In addition, a companion bill was passed that provides $150 million of general fund money to offset undercollections.) Large commercial/industrial/agricultural customers have an opportunity to ""opt-in"" to the 6.5 cent/kWh cap with an annual true-up. SDG&E will under a prudence review by the CPUC, which may be another source of funds to offset the undercollection. Specific classes subject to cap: Schedule A, all acute care hospitals, all public and private k-12 schools, all accounts on AL-TOU under 100 kW.

Legislative package only delays pain, critics warn By Craig D. Rose UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER September 1, 2000 Consumer and political leaders -- as well as Sempra Energy's chief executive -- said yesterday that the three electricity bills before Gov. Gray Davis do nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills. The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers ultimately face the daunting task of paying them. No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers. And while San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less now, they will pay back all or nearly all the savings -- plus interest -- beginning in 2003. ""The governor's bill postpones the pain, but the pain is still there,"" said Maureen O'Connor, a former mayor of San Diego who has been active in seeking relief from the soaring bills afflicting SDG&E's 1.2 million electricity customers. The rate bill promoted by Davis and now awaiting his signature will have SDG&E's customers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, or 70 percent more than what they paid as recently as May. Power companies, however, will continue to charge the customers as they have; presently, they're charging about 21 cents per kilowatt hour for SDG&E customers. The difference between 6.5 cents and whatever prices above that level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as IOUs for each customer in so-called balancing accounts. A second bill before the governor could provide up to $150 million in state money to help pay the balancing accounts, but the bulk of the IOUs will almost certainly be paid by SDG&E customers themselves when they become due in 2003 or 2004. A third bill before the governor would speed the construction of power plants. So while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe, it obligates them to pay the balance with interest later. The situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect: The higher electricity prices grow, the more is set aside in the balancing accounts -- and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts come due. Based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries, Sempra Energy estimates customers will owe $664 million by 2003. IOUs of that magnitude, said SDG&E, will require that customers pay a surcharge of $40 monthly for a year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills. Keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about $55; they now stand at about $130. Consumer advocates say it's likely power prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under the Davis proposal. ""The generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting profits,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, a San Francisco-based consumer group. Hoge said the bills that emerged ""seemed the best a corrupt system could spit out."" She added that TURN and other groups will shift their focus to pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restrain the electric generating companies and wholesale power markets. FERC, she said, must legally determine if charges from generating companies are reasonable. TURN and other groups will also press for re-regulation of the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants. Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network supports the Davis bill, although he said it won't fix ""the almost irreparably broken California 
Talked to Dave.  In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he sees it.  It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key points: Based on an expectation that the ""expedited siting"" bill would help site plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board. The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm requirement. The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting). In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO (which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of going to the market, thus killing the economics. On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that ""...it be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and

Enron has some vested interest in this legislation. We own interest in FuelCell Energy, Inc. and in a new micro-turbine company (SoloEnergy). At 5 MW there is not a lot of opportunity for Origination. On the other hand, at 5 MW it should be easy to permit this stuff and get units on-line in a matter of a few weeks. This legislation limits the technology by setting very low emissions thresholds. Many of the existing micro-turbines are not this clean. This legislation also assumes that the DG is at end-used sites. In my experience, my small distribution utilities will benefit by installing DG at their substations and at other sites throughout their service areas. Jeff

Hi Dale: Please call me to discuss your question.  (415.782.7822)  Customers could try to ""bypass"" the utility, but until Dec.

The Commission has issued a draft decision in the distributed generation proceeding.? It?adopts the Energy Division's program proposals for  load control and distributed generation initiatives and?authorizes a total  of $137.8 million in funding for these programs, on an annual basis through December 31, 2004. Since the Commission cannot raise electric utility rates until?it  has determined that the rate freeze is over, it has decided to include the costs of these programs in the utility's distribution revenue requirement, on the electric side, and defer consideration of an electric rate increase until the  rate freeze ends.? ? The three utilities are directed, within 15 days, to file Advice Letters increasing their electric distribution revenue requirements, without modifying  current rates, to include the authorized program budgets.? In the interim,  all program costs?are to?be tracked in balancing accounts, and the utilities should establish such accounts for this purpose.? The utilities

Dynegy: Enron a 'Model Competitor' It doesn't happen very often, so we're noting an apparently spontaneous comment from Dynegy Counsel Ed Ross at a FERC Roundtable last week that one of his chief competitors, Enron, ""has done an excellent job of being competitive."" He suggested others could look to Enron as a ""model competitor. They've done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a strong physical desk and we don't see any problem with it. I think they have set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the

Thanks, Scott. Scott/Hedy/Sandi/Bev:  Erik Letke heads up the retail marketing effort underway in San Diego.  Marty Sunde wants Alpert to have an EES commercial contact that she can talk to in the event she has further questions, etc., He'd like Erki to be the contact person.  Erik could you copy your vitals (title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they can forward along to Alpert? Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if needed): The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made the customer better off. Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and should have going forward. Any ""solution"" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the continuation of Direct Access for all customers. As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy. Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.

Regarding attempt to follow-up with those who called Alpert's office to complain, I wasn't clear on that action.  Likely makes sense for Eric to coordinate with Sandi to make the contact with Alpert's office.

Apologies. tues.  in office; maybe in Sacramento in afternoon wed. maybe in Sacramento thurs. s.f. 
Jim: Attached is a fairly distilled summary of the projects Enron's offered to the utilities, DWR and the ISO over the past 9-12 months, or so.  With respect to the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and Edison are included---the desk doesn't keep records of offers rejected, only offers accepted.  However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get more info on the other power deals offered to Edison, PG&E and SDG&E if folks would like that information.  Just let me know. Prices are included for the offers that had prices attached when submitted. Best, Jeff

Attached in Word format are the draft IEP comments, due to be filed on the 22nd, regarding the FERC Staff Report on market monitoring and market power mitigation.  This is my suggested approach, which is obviously subject to change per our discussion during the call tomorrow. I would like to highlight that the draft characterizes the approach as a ""circuit breaker"" during periods of highest demand and suggests that this is distinct from notions of market power abuse.  Other entities are arguing that during the highest demand, when it exceeds available supplies, all suppliers have and are ""exercising"" (as distinct from abusing?) market power.  The draft attempts to highlight the current regional supply context characterized

On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to bring more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies. The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of those customers. Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.

Good deal.  If there's anything else, just give a holler. Best, Jeff Eric Letke@EES 03/20/2001 04:31 PM 
I talked with Hedy (sp?) Govenar this afternoon.  Two developments:  1.) ""Noise"" from Ms. Alpert's office has stopped.  We believe initial reports from Staff may have been overstated.  2.)  Decisions on Enron's proposed amendments are due today.  Timing wouldn't not be right for a discussion with me. Action:  Hedy is aware of the situation and has asked Staff to tell her of any more occurrences.  Hedy has my number and will be in touch with any 
Marty:  Thanks for the information. Getting Eric's contact information to Alpert's office is in motion. Regarding attempt to follow-up with those who called Alpert's office to complain, I wasn't clear on that action.  Likely makes sense for Eric to coordinate with Sandi to make the contact with Alpert's office. Letters are an attempt to influence Alpert to 1) fix the Direct Access prohibition and 2) ensure that DA customers don't get saddled with the DWR costs. Let me know if this approach works. Best, Jeff Marty Sunde@EES 03/19/2001 07:02 PM 
All I asked Eric to do was: ensure that there was an Enron contact if another complaint came in. find out from Alpert's office if we could call back a few of those who called to complain to find out what they perceived, correct the misperception, apologize. Sent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON 
Thanks, Scott. Scott/Hedy/Sandi/Bev:  Erik Letke heads up the retail marketing effort underway in San Diego.  Marty Sunde wants Alpert to have an EES commercial contact that she can talk to in the event she has further questions, etc., He'd like Erki to be the contact person.  Erik could you copy your vitals (title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they can forward along to Alpert? Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if needed): The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made the customer better off. Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and should have going forward. Any ""solution"" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the continuation of Direct Access for all customers. As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy. Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.

We're getting a lot of inquiries about Enron's role in California's de-reg history, with a lot of misinformation arising out of Peace's handywork. I spent about 3 hours on Friday with a Sac Bee reporter (Dale Kasler).  He'll be interviewing Skilling on the same topic in a week or so, and he'd like to talk to Steve, too. Sue spent time with a NYT reporter discussing the same. Some common themes are arising in the questions.  Thought it would be a good idea to spend 30 minutes discussing those themes and developing our messages to ensure consistency.  If folks think it would be useful, is there a time this week that we could squeeze in 30 minutes?  Thanks. Best,

Greetings: Saw your QF story.? You were right.? One never know what the ""story du jour"" will be. You still interested in talking to Steve Kean?? If you are, when do you talk to Skilling, and would you want to schedule something around that, or sooner? Best, 
Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects. Overall, we respect the effort, but California failed to get the ball over the goal line: On Siting Intentionally or not, California has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state. Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in California. That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants. Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the legislation passed yesterday tinkers. Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes. If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will continue, or worsen. California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now. On the retail price cap They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat them hear) The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning. It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your door to collect. Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a couple of years down the road. So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely. There's a better answer: Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with another retail provider. Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals with companies like Enron.  But for the press reports, they hardly know

FYI:  The City of Long Beach has now joined in the law suits.  They've sued SoCalGas and El Paso claiming (like the others who've sued) that the two conspired to ""kill competition"" and drive up prices.

Utilities' Demand Blocks Bailout NEGOTIATIONS HIT SNAG: PG&E, Edison want end to price freeze if they sell transmission lines to state David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 21, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M N114450.DTL California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has learned. A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges that rates would remain unchanged. Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell the state their transmission systems and some land. The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers. The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from runaway wholesale electricity prices. The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped utilities. The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land, including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's dysfunctional electricity market.

PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Wednesday, March 21, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M N33580.DTL Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities that buy their power return to solvency. Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or ""QFs"" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. ""It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the money designed to compensate the QFs,"" Davis said. ""It's immoral and has to

California governor blames utilities for blackouts By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press SACRAMENTO, Calif. (March 21, 2001 8:10 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - Gov. Gray Davis said the state's two largest utilities are partly to blame for this week's widespread blackouts because they failed to pay millions of dollars owed to environmentally friendly power generators. Davis said the utilities took money from customers while failing to pay the alternative plants, which use renewable forms of energy like steam and natural gas to generate electricity. The state has been spending about $45 million a day since January to buy power for customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which are so credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them. ""It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not pay the generators,"" the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday. 
Mike:  Here are my comments.  Apologies for the fact that they are quick and dirty. All Enron's public statements that I have read, including, I think, statements made to financial analysts, state that our exposure in California is not ""material.""  Dennis' declaration says that the situation in California has been a ""financial disaster,"" that ""Enron has lost over $300 million,"" and that ""Enron stands to lose millions more.""  The losses are described as ""huge.""  Perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the market, but I'm not aware of it.  And if it hasn't, it could represent a significant conflict with previous statements.  Seems prudent to run this by IR and perhaps others before releasing. Regarding the statements about our hedging strategy.  It would seem prudent to run this through the organization for comment and discussion prior to making public. Very minor technical point--I don't think that AB 1890 was passed ""unanimously.""  I think that there was 1 nay vote. The statement is made that ""the utilities were required to sell off most of their generating capacity.""  The utilities were only required to sell off 1/2 of their fossil-fired plants (which I think at the time may have amounted to about .2-.25 of their total gen assets).  They chose voluntarily to sell of the remainder of their fossil-fired plants. It is stated that stranded costs are ""investments in imprudent power generation facilities.""  These investments were in fact found in the past to be prudent by the PUC.  Would therefore not seem accurate to call them imprudent now. Is it now ""virtually impossible to manage commodity risk"" in California? Just wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation somewhat. From a PR perspective, I'm wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing UC/CSU in the following manner, ""It was actually a relatively easy decision to make.""  Makes Enron sound perhaps excessively hard-nosed. Best,

Hi Professor: Could you let me know if you receive this?  I've been sending you emails lately and, having gotten no response, am concerned about whether there's some sort of problem on my end, your end, or both.  Thanks very much. Best, 
Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects. Overall, we respect the effort, but California failed to get the ball over the goal line: On Siting Intentionally or not, California has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state. Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in California. That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants. Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the legislation passed yesterday tinkers. Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes. If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will continue, or worsen. California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now. On the retail price cap They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat them hear) The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning. It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your door to collect. Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a couple of years down the road. So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely--bad solution. There's a better answer: Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with another retail provider. Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was neglecting to establish a retail market in its restructuring legislation. Urging customers to stay with the utility made matters worse, given the volatility of the Power Exchange. (Variable rate mortgage story.) But some customers who did switch and who took a fixed-price deal with companies like ours are doing very well. But for the press reports, the customers who switched to those deals hardly know there's a crisis. So California needs to follow's Pennsylvania's lead and make a market that works for retail customers. If the price spikes in the PX worry you, the best way to protect yourself is to leave the utility and switch to another provider who's willing to take on that risk on your behalf. Remove the monopoly that California originally granted to the PX. Just like the customers who switched, the utilities could have bought fixed-price power and protected themselves from the PX's price volatility. But for some crazy reason, California forced the utilities to buy everything from PX. And the utilities have complained about it---even former monopolies don't like buying from a monopoly. Let the utility buy from any competitive source available. Don't meld the PX with the ISO---that would simply re-enforce the PX monopoly and make a bad situation much worse. Make California's ISO a for-profit ""Transco,"" like we have in our interstate gas pipeline system [[I leave this last recommendation as food for thought.  May be too much to bite off.]] Have a good holiday. Best, Jeff

Jeanne, I think you are saying more and going into more detail than we need to.  It was my understanding from the call that you were not going to get into the statutory interpretation issues at all. I think modifying the first sentence of the carryover to the top of page 2 (at least as printed on my machine) is fully sufficient if you just say: ""Moreover, EPMI submits that DWR has presented the Commission with a reasonable [STRIKEOUT interpretation of the STRIKEOUT]  approach for 
Editorial/Opinion Making it hot for deregulation Gregory Palast The New York Times 08/29/2000 The News & Observer Raleigh, NC Final A11 (Copyright 2000) PECONIC, N.Y. -- While reporters ogled celebrities at Barbra Streisand's bungalow during the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles, something important was being debated 100 miles to the south in San Diego, where there was a real display of populism. There politicians have enrolled 2 million citizens in a scary economic experiment. This year, San Diego became the first city in California to experience the end of state regulation of electricity prices. When California's lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity, they wrote into the law that homeowners' bills would fall ""by at least 20 percent."" In fact, bills jumped 124 percent this August over last. Rather than repudiate this mad market experiment, the federal government and 24 other states have rushed to imitate California's lead. Actually, Californians were lucky. Every hour of every day, San Diego Gas and Electric, the local utility, must now buy its electricity at a state auction known as a power pool. On the first hot day this summer, during the noonday heat, the companies that produce the power, newly deregulated, cranked up their bids to $9,999 per megawatt hour. That's about 5,000 percent more than the once- controlled price of $20, but it could have been worse. According to those inside the secretive auction agency, sellers assumed the pool's computers could handle only four-digit bids. In fact, the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day. One can trace California's electricity market plague largely to a single source, Daniel Fessler. In the early 1990s, Fessler, then president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, developed an infatuation with one of Margaret Thatcher's free-market ventures: the troubled England-Wales Power Pool. How strange. Britons pay about 70 percent more for electricity than Americans. That's hardly a surprise, as each day around tea time, when England's usage peaks, a small clique of power plant owners take over the electricity auction, bidding up prices by 200 percent to 2,000 percent. In the United States, utilities vowed they would play no such tricks if California removed the limits on profits that have been at the core of regulation policy for the past 100 years. The promise lasted several months, during which time five giant international electricity sellers - all new to California - imported the techniques they'd learned in Britain that were designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month produce profits once permitted for an entire year. The deregulation bug is now winging eastward. New York City, for example, has reportedly succumbed to 43 percent increases in Con Edison bills. But in San Diego, something extraordinary happened. This month, thousands joined an unprecedented consumers' boycott. The power companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses won't pay. Refuseniks include the Council of Churches, the school district and - without a hint of shame - Steve Peace, the state senator who sponsored the deregulation law. * * * The electricity fiasco should be a godsend for Al Gore's campaign. After all, it was Fessler and his fellow Republicans who threw California's consumers to the meager mercies of the marketplace. And Gov. George W. Bush pushed through deregulation in Texas, which is widely expected produce hefty returns for a former business partner, Sam Wyly, owner of the GreenMountain, a power seller. But while Gore spoke out in Los Angeles against ""powerful forces,"" on this subject he's mum. No wonder: the Clinton-Gore administration still promotes California-style deregulation as a model for the nation. But someone's ready to feel California's pain, and it's not good news for Gore. During the Democrats' big show, Ralph Nader went to San Diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the Utility Consumer Action Network, the 46,000-member local group leading the anti-corporate uprising. Electricity is the first big U.S. industry formerly under the tight control of states to be opened up to international operators and their free market rules. For the first time, Americans feel the bite of real globalization, and

I spoke with ABAG attorney Kenneth Moy and APS attorney Dan Douglas. Neither was thrilled with the Wood/Barnett draw, but neither was immediately warm to the notion of a negotiated continuance.  I outlined the arguments against charging into the guns of Wood and Barnett, and reminded them that there could very likely be delays anyway as a result of the CPUC's continued indecision about the end of the rate freeze--which looks to be increasing as a result of the Administration's deadlock with the utilities.  They both indicated that they would discuss the matter with their clients and get back to us shortly.  I suspect at least one of them will say ""no we want to go ahead even if you do not.""  As soon as I hear from them, I will contact SCE and PG&E.  Mike Day

Hey, Neville.  FYI. Best, Mike Kahn's best buddy 
This paraphrased from Tom Briggs, Enron Govt Affairs, DC: The Bush Administration has indicated that it will not support any sort of legislation containing price caps.  Although something could get out of the Senate, it won't go anywhere without Administration support. Thus, by default, the just and reasonable standard becomes the FERC's evolving rate-screen process, which, for imports into California, is  ""daily spot market gas prices and an average 12,000 Btu/kWh heat rate.""  The standard for in-state resoruces is higher, more like 18,000 Btu/KwH. Instead, expect to see legislation that will take short-term actions to increase supply and decrease demand.  This could include demand buy down programs, and laws the force utility financial solvency. Every day is a new day but I am told this will likely be the status quo until the congressional recess is over (recess is from 6-30 April). 
Steve/Lisa: Environmental issues and the permitting will be the biggest (and could be very big) obstacles---particularly given the Santa Barbara location (e.g., Channel Islands, etc.).  Might be a good idea to have GA look into that side of things.  If we feel that can be overcome, then the next big deal will be getting transportation agreements with SoCalGas.  Finally, the issue you raised Steve---will Davis want to be the counterparty?---will loom somewhat large.  Overall sounds like an exciting idea/opportunity. Best, 
That answers it.  Thanks very much. Best, Jeff <Michele_Yoskovich@mckinsey.com> 03/22/2001 04:02 PM

Contract, Sell Electricity Elsewhere 
Court Gives Green Light to Green Generator To Suspend Edison Contract, Sell Electricity Elsewhere Business Wire 03/22/01, 4:43p (Copyright , 2001, Business Wire) EL CENTRO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 22, 2001--A California court ruled today that a geothermal energy supplier in the Imperial Valley can temporarily sell its electricity on the open market despite its long-term contracts with Southern California Edison, because Edison has breached the contract by failing to pay for any output since Nov. 1. Cal Energy Operating Corp. operates a complex of geothermal plants near the Salton Sea. The plants filed suit Feb. 20 in Imperial County Superior Court seeking back payment from Edison and authorization to suspend their contracts with Edison and sell power elsewhere in California during such time Edison is unable to pay for power demand. David L. Sokol, chairman of Cal Energy, said, ""We applaud this short-term solution that will provide us with a revenue lifeline and keep our clean, renewable power flowing to Californians. It is unfortunate that it took court 
Yes, it's technically true, but it doesn't seem relevant.  It's a technicality.  That is, if at the end of the contract, UC/CSU goes to another provider, the rules would require Enron to ""de-DASR,"" after which the new provider would submit the new DASR to switch the customer over.  The utility stands in the middle of all this.  I don't think this equates to what UC/CSU is claiming the problem is.  Might be viewed as a bit ""cute"" by the judge. Also, the legislation ""fixing"" the prohibition passed our of policy committee today in Sacramento and is moving through the Legislature.

Sokol said at press conference yesterday 
This is yet another, tangible case of why price caps don't and can't help; they can and will only make matters worse.  Caps are a policy chainsaw when a scalpel is needed.  The result of the caps being imposed on QFs by Davis and the Legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy, which will reduce supply and decrease reliability----the exact opposite of what the state needs to be doing. FYI:  I listened in to Sokol's conference call yesterday re: court case freeing CalEnergy from the QF contract.  Sokol blasted Edison over and over (e.g., accumulated war chest of over $2 billion in cash).  Sokol said that, at least for the time being, this lessens the need for CalEnergy specifically to force an involuntary.  Be interesting to see if other QFs take similar tack.  Sokol also said that CalEnergy has sold the power to El Paso---lot's of press questions about price and where the power's headed (i.e., in our out of state).   He said he expects to get a ""market price"" from El Paso and that 
FYI. 
? The legislature will meet and vote to repeal Section 390 of AB 1890.  This will reverse what the QFs get  paid from natural gas costs and replace it with the formula in the governor's current plan - 7.9 cents/kwh for 5-year contracts and 6.9 cents/kwh for 10-year  contracts.  According to sources, this is ""locked in to pass.""  It  will be implemented by a PUC order on Monday. ? The QFs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they would get paid.   This  plan would not generate enough money for many QFs to operate profitably.  At  least 2,000 MW of the total 5,407 MW of gas-fired QFs would be unable to generate  a positive cash flow and would have to either operate unprofitably or shut down. ? The QF community is responding with an increased militancy for an involuntary filing, according to sources.  The most aggressive QF after Coram Energy is David Sokol and Walter Scott of Mid-America Energy (based in

This sort of summary info is incredibly useful.  Where's it coming from and can we get it daily? Best, Jeff James D Steffes 03/23/2001 07:49 AM 
Executive Summary: ? The as yet unnumbered rescue bill by Davis made it to the Senate floor ? An exemption of the gas-fired QFs from this bill (as proposed by Sen. Keeley) could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing. ? If passed, the draft CPUC order would give the utilities another 15 days after rate hikes to pay the QFs ? The negotiations with the QFs are complicated by the issue of payments owed by the utilities to the DWR. Senators are demanding that the utilities set up a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the DWR. ? The CalEnergy ruling (as reported by Bloomberg this PM) is an attractive option for other QFs looking to at least temporarily escape long-term supply contracts with Edison. ? If neither the CPUC nor the legislature exempts the gas-fired generators from the new rate structure, an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is expected.  However, if the exemption is implemented, then a bankruptcy filing would be delayed. 1. ""QF Bill"" Makes it to Senate Floor The ""CPUC bill"" (the number is not yet known) is in mock-up form and does the following: * Repeals PUC Code section 390, which set a formula for QFs under deregulation. * Amends portions of AB 1X which will ensure that DWR receives money for its power purchases, and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds. * Includes a provision for SDG&E rates since they were not covered under other legislation. The bill passed the Senate Energy (8-2), and also just passed the Senate Appropriations Committee (8-2) and is headed to the Senate Floor. 2. Senator Comments on the Bill: Keeley (author of bill) presented that the bill would allow the PUC to decide the QF contracts which is the proper authority  to debate the issue. Most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact that the bill provides no guidance to the PUC regarding voided costs for natural gas-fired QFs.  Republicans offered an amendment to not have section 390 repealed for gas-fired generators, but Keeley had concerns with the amendment.  Keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the PUC's flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad.  He also indicated that gas-fired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft order.  He said that the PUC order needs to be amended, and Keeley is confident that the PUC has recognized that in discussion over the past 48 hours. 3. Opponents to the QF Bill: The following people testified in opposition to QF portion:  TURN, Delta Power (QF), Syke Energy, John Hancock Financial, California Manufacturers Association, Crockett Cogeneration, Independent Energy Producers, Clean Power Campaign, PG&E, SCE. The gas-fired QFs that testified in opposition noted that they have been off-line for a couple of months and cannot come back on-line unless their issues are addressed. In response to the QFs not getting paid, Sen. Bowen stated that if the utilities do not pay the QFs as directed under the draft order, then she would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy. 4. PG&E and SCE Testimony: Sen. Battin asked both utilities about the draft order, which states that after the change in the rates by QFs the utilities must pay the QFs within 15 days, and whether the utilities would abide by the order. PG&E's response was that they are receiving $400 million per month, the cost of their own generation is $100 million, and the QF amount is $240 million per month; the draft order would lower the QF cost to $140 million.   PG&E was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to Battin's question was ""yes or no.""  Battin, Bowen and Murray all asked whether it was yes or no.  The PG&E rep stated that it would be ""no"" if the issue of the payments owed to ISO and DWR is not resolved.  If the ISO costs of purchases were included in the DWR payments, then PG&E would not have a problem. The SCE response was that if the money coming in was less than the money going out, then it could not comply with the PUC order. 5.  Payments to DWR Senator Sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under AB 1X that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the DWR for purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those. SCE responded that they are still in negotiations with DWR on the terms and conditions.  Several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of the bill, and that they should have a trust fund set up.  PG&E noted that they are setting 'some' money aside, but would not state how much. Sen. Sher ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or 'go after them' for violating the law. 1X Provisions: Tim Gage from Dept. of Finance noted the Governor's support of the entire bill, and noted that the 1X provisions would ensure that DWR gets paid. PG&E also testified in opposition to these provisions. Senator Bowen made the following statements: * Senator Peace has announced that he has received another notice of $500 million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the funding unless PG&E and SCE drop their challenge to the PUC regarding the DWR issue. * Also stated that the PUC could always raise rates as a way to resolve the issue.

I spoke yesterday with President Lynch's gas advisor and the PUC staffer who first got in touch with us regarding inquiries from our customer regarding whether we were returning customers to the LDCs. I described our activities generally, and explained that the originial inquiry from our customer stemmed from a mix-up (on our part) that has since been cleared up. Both seemed satisfied, appreciated the call and the information and will get back to me regarding whether we'll need to submit a formal response to President Lynch's letter. (I said that our preference was not to respond formally, but would be happy to do so.) I asked them to contact me directly should they receive any other inquiries from our customers. Thanks to all for the help in responding. Please keep me in the loop on our marketing activities, etc. If I hear anything about customers calling the PUC, I'll let you know, and I'll let you know what I hear back from Lynch's office regarding whether we need to respond formally.

A01 LENGTH: 579 words HEADLINE: State not a major power glutton CHARGES FALL FLAT: Statistics show California to be cautious user of energy supplies BYLINE: Andrew Bridges; The Associated Press BODY: LOS ANGELES -- California's continuing power crisis has led neighboring states to accuse the Golden State of hogging electricity, saying its appetite for energy threatens to plunge the entire West into darkness. But the numbers paint a different picture, one of a California that does use a vast amount of electricity but consumes less on a per-capita basis than all other states except Rhode Island. Mild weather and having proportionately fewer energy-gobbling industries than some other states are part of the reason. However, experts say credit also must go to stringent conservation guidelines. ""It's true we're big, and it's true we didn't build a lot of power plants because of restructuring. But we're not energy hogs at all,"" said Arthur Rosenfeld, who sits on the five-member California Energy Commission.

What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy, anyway? If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know. Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

I'm on vacation next week, but would be happy to get together first thing the following week to discuss. Also, in response to a voicemail that I received, wanted to let folks know that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today. The legislature is, however, holding hearings, taking a ""comprehensive view"" of the industry (i.e., focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity ""price gouging"").  They held their first hearing today, but it got cut short due to activities underway in the Legislature.  I believe that, prior to cutting the hearing short, the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers, who told stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship. One panel participant (Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms, I believe) waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and December.  I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting the PUC to appear that it's doing something.  I'll report more on the Legislative hearings as they occur.

Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook Davis favors tiered rate increases David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Sunday, March 25, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/25/M N30195.DTL Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system. Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt utilities. If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way. ""We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,"" said Larry Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. ""We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use it,

It looks like tomorrow, Wednesday 9/6, at 5:30 Eastern time/2:30 Pacific works for most people.  Any objection? I will send around an agenda by tomorrow morning which includes the progress of the GSPP alumni group to date.  I look forward to welcoming Carl and Severin and speaking with all of you to nail down a list of speakers to begin contacting. Rob P.S. Coincidentally, I would highly recommend Carl's recent book Information Rules as a new economy business strategy guide that even has some relevance in what often appears as the old economy backwaters of the electric industry. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/087584863X/o/qid=968173636/sr=8-1/ref=a ps _sr_b_1_3/002-4543327-5556850.  The parallel of Carl and Severin's work to place the popular mythologies of the electric industry and information economy into tried-and-true economic principles is interesting.  That, in combination with tried-and-true public policy methods will be a strong antidote to many of the current political proposals. 
FYI, in case you haven't already seen this: CalPERS has big energy tie By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau (Published March 26, 2001) When Californians complain about energy outlaws romping through the chaotic electricity market, carting wagonloads of money to Texas, one name often tops the list: Enron Corp. But at least one pretty sizeable wagon full of cash has not gone home to energy moguls in 10-gallon hats, but rather to retired California government workers on pensions. For eight years, Enron has had an unusual investment partnership with the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the fund that administers retirement and health benefits to more than 1 million past and present public employees. Most recently, the two agreed in 1998 to pony up half a billion dollars each for business ventures in energy companies, including Enron subsidiaries -- although not the one that markets electricity in California. CalPERS and Enron have, on average, doubled their money each year. That makes the Enron deal one of the pension fund's most lucrative. CalPERS owns stock in thousands of companies, including high-performing electricity generators and lagging utilities. But Enron is one of fewer than 10 companies involved in this kind of venture with the pension fund. ""Enron is one of our oldest and closest relationships here in the alternative investment area,"" Barry Gonder, a CalPERS senior investment officer, told a CalPERS committee last October. ""And as you all know, it's a

FYI US House panel sets April hearings on Calif crisis ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. House Government Reform Committee said Wednesday it would hold three field hearings in California next month on the economic fallout from the state's chronic electricity shortages. The hearings will take place on April 10 in Sacramento, April 11 in San Jose, and April 12 in San Diego. California, which has struggled to keep the lights on since last autumn, is widely expected to face blackouts during the peak power demand months of the summer. On Tuesday, state regulators approved an average 40 percent increase in consumer electricity rates to cover the soaring cost of energy and pump more cash into the state's near-bankrupt utilities.

Summary of action items from today's IEP member company lobbyist conference call: Discussion re: SB 28x (Sher) and direct access - Chris Ellison and I are meeting with staff from Sher and Wright=01,s offi= ces to discuss amendments to SB 28x to make it more comprehensive.  I will report to IEP and members the results of the meeting in my weekly legislative status report tomorrow. - IEP has an appointment with Asm. Cox on Tuesday at 8:30 am.  The message to him is support linking SB 28x and a direct access bill with SB 5x, and oppose =01&California first=018 language and changes to the outage and main= tenance coordination (i.e., AB 60x, AB 8x, and SB 39x).  IEP members are invited to join.  Please let me know if you are going to attend.  I will report to IEP members the results of the meeting. - In the meantime, since SB 28x is likely to be heard on Monday, all available IEP member company lobbyists should make contact with members of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee to support SB 28x with the caveat that we would like to see some additional changes. Discussion re: AB 60x (Hertzberg) - Available IEP member company lobbyists should make contact with members o= f the Senate Energy Committee to oppose AB 60x.  The message is twofold: 1) the bill creates another obstacle in the siting process when the state should be streamlining it; and, 2) as a net-importer, California would be sending the wrong signals to its neighboring states that send us power in our time of need.  I will forward under separate cover the agreed-upon amendments that we would be willing to live with if we can=01,t kill the bi= ll. Discussion re: AB 8x (Migden) -  All available IEP member company lobbyists will, once again, make contac= t with Assembly Member Migden's office to support a meeting to discuss IEP=01= ,s proposed amendments to make this bill work.

Mr. President, we request that you help protect California's economy, and indeed that of the Western region and the nation.  Please support the Governors' request on wholesale rates, investigate the recent allegations of overcharges, and act to prevent a dysfunctional electricity market from damaging our constituents and a major engine of the nation's economy.

Davis Blames Crisis On State Republicans But Democratic controller points at governor Carla Marinucci, John Wildermuth, Chronicle Political Writers Sunday, April 1, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/01/M N154353.DTL Anaheim -- The politics of energy dominated the state Democratic convention yesterday, as anxious delegates gave a lukewarm reception to embattled Gov. Gray Davis, who clashed bitterly with party rival, Controller Kathleen Connell. Speaking at the Anaheim convention center, where dimmed lights were a constant reminder of yesterday's Stage 2 alert, Davis blamed California's energy woes on former Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican lawmakers and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which, he charged, has failed to regulate

Attached is the draft that we've discussed.  Few points: It's a draft.  It would benefit from more tinkering. It takes our core messages (what's the problem?  what's the solution?) and tries to weave in current events, understanding that by the time you're giving the presentation it may need to be further modified to correspond with rapidly changing circumstances and events. It's frank but (hopefully) measured in describing the mess that is California.  It's set up so that it's easy to modify the more pointed statements. Leaves plenty of room for you to tailor the presentation to particular points that you'd like to make, or data and/or information that you'd like to include. I didn't have ready access to charts and graphs to back up the stats used in the text of the presentation, but I'm sure that it will be relatively easy for someone in Houston to pull that together (e.g., may want to poach a bit from Belden's presentation to include some PNW hydro stats (which I've also attached), or from ISO website to show load-resource balance info). Though I'll be on vacation, I'll be checking in on voicemail and email, so if you have any questions, or need something additional to get the presentation ready, just let me know. I may be in an airplane on Monday during both the leadership call and the newly restructured California call.  Otherwise, I'll be trying to make those calls dailywhile I'm away. And Jim, I'll also be available to participate in any calls regarding Calger's proposed deal with CDWR. Finally, when the darn thing prints out, it prints borders around the heading/title box and the text box, though I don't know why.  Tried just about everything to get rid of them.  May want to have a PP guru in Houston see if (s)he can disable the boders. Best, Jeff

Hi Jason: Per my voice mail, here's the package of materials for customers to use to make sure key policy makers know that maintaining customer choice in California is critical.  As I mentioned in the voice mail, the Legislature's likely to move this week on a variety of fronts, so it's important that the business community make its voice heard immediately and clearly.

The rankings and related stories are also available on line at http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/beyond/bchome.htm. ""We are always pleased when a ranking reflects the reality we live every day, which is that the Haas School is a world-class institution, with faculty and students who are extraordinarily innovative and accomplished and, consequently, very much in demand by every type of major business and academic organization, everywhere on earth,"" said Jay Stowsky, associate dean for school affairs and initiatives. Several specialty programs at Haas were also ranked among the top 10 nationwide in a part of the US News survey that is based on the opinions of deans and MBA Program heads.

CLASSES START TODAY FOR NEW MASTER'S IN FINANCIAL ENGINEERING DEGREE AT HAAS For 49 students classes start today for the Master's in Financial Engineering (MFE), a new graduate degree program at the Haas School of Business. Of the 49 students, 6 are taking the program to earn a concurrent degree with the MBA program, combining the in-depth study of financial economics and the dynamics of markets with the general management education of the MBA program. The class of 2002 is represented by an international group of highly educated scientists and professionals: The inaugural class represents 19 countries: 7 students come from China, 6 come from Canada, 5 from Korea, and 5 come from five different European countries. Also represented are South America (Chile and Colombia), Africa (Zimbabwe), and Southeast Asia (India and Indonesia), as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Russia, and the Republic of Georgia. Top professions include finance (25%), engineering (18%), and research & development (11%) 18% hold a Ph.D. and 25% hold a master's degree in another field. One fourth of the class performed in the top percentile of the GMAT. The Haas MFE is the first such degree program in the United States that is offered entirely under the auspices of a business school. It is also the first US program to require its students to take a three-month internship at a top financial firm as part of the learning experience. The Haas MFE program will prepare candidates with superior analytical skills for a growing niche of quantitative finance careers. MFE candidates will train for positions as risk managers, investment bankers, asset managers, derivatives traders, and developers of specialized securities at the world's leading commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, and corporate and public treasury departments. Founding sponsors include some of the world's top financial firms, namely AIG Inc., Barclays Global Investors, BARRA Inc., Gifford Fong Associates, Goldman Sachs & Co., First Union Bank, KMV LLC, MBIA Inc., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Quantal International Inc., The Dean Witter Foundation, and WR Hambrecht + Co., LLC. Sponsoring firms will be accepting interns from the programs. ""We're seeing tremendous interest among talented individuals coming from technical backgrounds, such as engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, who are in narrow jobs and are keen to transition to a brand new career where opportunities are abundant and continue to grow,"" says MFE Executive Director John O'Brien.

SHARING OUR STRENGTHS: THE HAAS/BOALT CONNECTION This is the first in a continuing series of articles in Haas NewsWire chronicling the Haas School's interdisciplinary activities. The Haas School has traditionally pursued interdisciplinary partnerships on the Berkeley campus. During her tenure as dean, Laura Tyson has made it her priority to increase Haas' partnerships in the areas of teaching, research, and public service with other disciplines. One of the most vibrant of these is with the Boalt School of Law. ""Haas faculty are well known for their path-breaking work on competitive strategy in the Internet age, and Boalt is recognized for having the strongest intellectual property law faculty in the country, particularly as regards IP questions arising in cyberspace,"" said Jay Stowsky, associate dean for school affairs and initiatives. ""The collection, in one place, at the same time, of so many notable scholars in an area of rich intellectual ferment and intense public interest is an extraordinary intellectual opportunity.

Sagging Telecommunications Sector Leads Nasdaq Down By Johnathan Burns 04/03/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The telecommunications sector led the Nasdaq Composite Index down Tuesday, as investors worrying about the earnings season and a slowdown in carrier spending hammered many stocks to new lows. The selloff of telecommunications carriers and equipment makers was widespread, with all of the big-name companies trading negatively. Shares of optical component maker JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) earlier hit a 52-week low, recently trading down 11% to $14.88. Optical systems market leader Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) also hit a 52-week low, recently trading down 7% to $13. The day's biggest loser in the equipment space was optical systems maker Ciena Corp. (CIEN), which hit a new low and was recently trading down 16.5% to $35.50. The bloodshed was so widespread that a host of other equipment companies also hit new lows: Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) recently traded down 11% to $7.88 while Corvis Corp. (CORV) was recently down 14.4% to $5.19. A rash of earnings warnings by software companies like Redback Networks Inc. (RBAK) and fiber optic equipment maker Harmonic Inc. (HLIT) after the bell Monday, coupled with continued funding concerns for start-up phone companies, served as a one-two punch for the sector. Start-up phone company Winstar Communications Inc. (WCII) recently traded down almost 54% to 41 cents, while peers Teligent Inc. (TGNT) dropped 31% to 28 cents and XO Communications Inc. fell 38% to $3.22. Investors have become increasingly nervous that those companies will face bankruptcy, as the capital markets have dried up. Even well-funded carriers weren't exempt from Tuesday's selling pressure. Shares of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Q) barely stayed above its 52-week low of $32.13, recently dropping 6.2% to $33.50, while shares of AT&T Corp. (T) were off 5.1% to $20 and WorldCom Inc. (WCOM) fell 6.4% to $17.50. -By Johnathan Burns, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2020; johnathan.burns@dowjones.com Folder Name: Telecom Technology: Fiber Optics Relevance Score on Scale of 100: 65 ______________________________________________________________________ To review or revise your folder, visit Dow Jones CustomClips or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

I spoke w/ Bill Julian, Cmmr. Wood's Advisor, about the hearing that is being held on Friday, September 8 in San Diego.  There will be a morning panel and an afternoon panel.  The morning panel will discuss ""pricing behavior/patterns"" and the afternoon panel will provide explanations/refutations of the morning presentations.  I'm not sure yet who will be speaking, but I have inquired from Steve Weisman, who appears to be heading this effort. Do we want an Enron representative on the panel?  Who would be the best witness? While this investigation has the opportunity to turn into a witch hunt, I am also concerned about the record being developed in such a way as to lead to the conclusion that Wood, or the legislature, have in mind.  This could mean an attempt by the Commission to assert more regulation in the market, assert more state (vs. federal) jurisdiction, build a case for collapsing the ISO/PX into one organization, or hang blame on generators and scheduling coordinators. I think Tim and Mary's presentation would be very effective in showing the other (real) side of the story. The following is an exerpt from the pre-hearing conference transcript held on 8/28 from Cmmr Wood: 27               I am not going to sit here and say that it's not 28    an appropriate time to assign blame.  If there has been 1    wrongdoing, we will assign blame.  We will ferret out the 2    wrongdoers, and we will bring them to account to the 3    greatest of our ability. 4               But I think that, as Judge Wetzell pointed out, 5    the scope of this proceeding is quite broad.  We are not 6    only addressing the immediate issues, but we are also 7    addressing the underlying problems of this market which 8    clearly is not functioning, which clearly is broken. 9               We have to look at problems with the structure of 10    the market, we have to look at problems with the behavior of 11    market participants; and getting beyond the wholesale 12    market, we have to look at the interaction with the retail 13    market because, after all, that's where the pain actually 14    occurs.  That's what consumers themselves face. 15               There are probably implications for the long-term 16    viability of California's utilities that are connected with 17    this proceeding, and we have to get into that.  And for that 18    reason, as well as the fact that the other utilities in 19    California are going to be coming out of the rate freeze at 20    some point in the future, we have to consider the statewide 21    implications of what we're doing. 22               So this is not just the San Diego proceeding, 23    although we are focused on events here in the San Diego 24    area. Mona L Petrochko 08/30/2000 03:51 PM 
Wood, the Assigned Commissioner in the investigation of wholesale electric markets, has asked for comments on the following questions by Friday, September 8.  We are an individual party to the case as well as a member of ARM and WPTF. This would be a good opportunity to get our version of what is wrong on the record.  The presentation that Tim and Mary put together for FERC will be helpful in answering these questions.  I will take a first cut at drafting response to be circulated by Tuesday of next week.  We can take liberties in providing responses that go beyond the question asked. Market Structure: Are the market conditions currently being experienced (price spikes and suppy shortages) inevitable under the current market structure? Do generators and/or scheduling coordinators have market power? Is there a need to mitigate such market power? Which market participants or other entities are responsible for reliability planning? Do California regulatory agencies have adequate jurisdiction to ensure reasonable prices and reliable service? Do the structures and governance of the Cal ISO and PX adequately support the goals of providing reasonably priced and reliable service? Market Rules: Are there rules which allow or encourage unacceptable market outcomes? What roles, if any, do underscheduling in forward markets, out of state transfers, uniform PX auction prices and ISO real-time and out-of-market purchases play in the outcomes being experienced? Behavior of Market Participants: What is working and not working in terms of price, reliability, information exchange, resource distribution, equity, service quality, and types of planned generation?

Tuesday April 3, 6:15 pm Eastern Time Edison gets more time; Calif. may sell $14 bln bonds (UPDATE: Recasts, adds details throughout, byline) By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), parent of troubled utility Southern California Edison, said on Tuesday bankers are giving it and the utility more time to cure their defaults on three credit lines. The announcement came after the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC), which sets rates, also on Tuesday voted to authorize the state's Department of Water Resources to sell between $12 billion and $14 billion of bonds to finance power purchases, and examine the financial links between the utilities and their parents. The 30-day extension from Edison's banks means the banks will ``forbear,'' or not act upon, the credit line defaults. ``That will take us out to basically around April 14,'' said Ted Craver, chief financial officer of Edison International, during an investor conference call. The prior forbearance, the banks' second, had expired March 13. The California power crisis has led to periodic blackouts and left SoCal Edison, which owes more than $5.4 billion for post power costs, and the state's largest utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which owes about $8.9 billion, on the brink of bankruptcy. A rate freeze imposed under the state's 1996 utility deregulation law has prevented them from passing on their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers. Though the PUC awarded the utilities a roughly 40 percent rate hike last week, allowing them to collect $4.8 billion more each year, analysts and the utilities said the hike effectively does nothing to let the utilities to recoup their prior costs. ``At best the utility is standing still (in that) it hasn't improved its cash flow or its cash position,'' said Craver. ``At worst, it is going backwards. That's our basic conclusion on the numbers and the mechanisms as we understand them.'' San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG - news), parent of Pacific G&E, has said it expects to take a $4.1 billion charge for unrecouped electricity costs, while Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison has said it may take a ``substantial'' charge that may total as much as $2.7 billion. The California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's power grid, early on Tuesday called another Stage Two emergency alert because of supply problems. Such alerts are declared when power reserves fall to within 5 percent of peak demand. The alert was later lifted. Edison shares closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $12.82, up 27 cents, or 2.2 percent. PG&E shares closed on the Big Board at $11.53, down 22 cents, or 1.9 percent. Craver also said in the conference call that SoCal Edison has rolled over 364-day and 5-year Libor-based credit facilities that recently matured for a respective 30 and 90 days, and that Edison rolled over one of its own facilities for 45 days. He concluded the call by expressing relief that creditors have not yet thrown the utility into bankruptcy, which analysts have said could already have happened by now had the PUC not granted the rate hike. ``I'm somewhat amazed about how disciplined everybody has been,'' he said. ``We're seeking protection from misguided regulatory decisions, and the solution is really in that same venue, in the regulatory and political and legislative context.''

Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms (Published April 4, 2001) There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that envelops California's energy crisis. Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals for blame. No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis have gone into semihibernation. Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will backfire. ""Just remember Jimmy Carter,"" state Controller Kathleen Connell warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have ""no excuses"" for perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. ""We will be accountable on Election Day 2002,"" she said. Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his actions, saying, ""I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this problem,"" and trying to pin blame on Republicans. Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder, Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis Davis. The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled ""Meeting the Energy Challenge"" to defend the governor's actions, it's apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit. The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float. Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit. Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission grid have stalled, perhaps permanently. The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis. Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

I need to check more, but here's my take.  Politically---very popular with legislators; very easy to pass, etc.  However, it would be so complicated to implement and is very likely in conflict with so many federal laws, that I think they'll have an extremely difficult time pulling it off.  In addition, the utilities (whose retained generation collected a big portion of the ""windfall"" selling through the PX) would be subject to a big tax hit.  Would that push them into bankruptcy?  In short, easy to pass politically, pretty difficult to make stick legally.  This help? You still have your PCG position? Best, Jeff Michelle D Cisneros@ECT 04/04/2001 03:24 PM

Thought that you might find this interesting. Best, Jeff Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product 2001-04-04 17:19 (New York) By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise, knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more important. For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping track of credit risk has always been part of doing business. That became even more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based commodities trading network. In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders manage the credit risk. Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited basis. Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope. Last month, the company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format. Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known as the ""Enron cost of credit."" The rating is expressed as an interest rate. The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy and other related information. While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has turned the product into a new revenue stream. Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for a fee. The site also can sell a user a ""digital bankruptcy swap,"" which is a way to hedge against credit exposure. The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against. For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately. According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity. The tool is important because ""in just a short amount of time, a company's

She's Scott's point person on public policy, and she's been working on the energy issue.  Mavis had done some checking and no one had heard anything about direct access. Sun is active in three main trade associations: the Chamber, the American Electronics Association (AEA) and Technet.  None of those organizations said their members were asking for direct access, but Mavis promised to put calls in to them and get direct access on the radar screen.

Short of Power 
Short of Power Gov. Davis open to tax on electric generators' profits Updated: April 4, 2001 - 5:52 p.m. Gov. Gray Davis says he is open to supporting a windfall-profits tax being proposed by lawmakers on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California this year. He also broke with his appointees on the Public Utilities Commission in saying private companies and other large users should be allowed to contract directly for power with generators. . . . . For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities. A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts. ""That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid,"" Davis said. ""But our problem is the opposite this summer. If companies want to get off the

HEADLINE: ?Calif. Governor To Address State BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. BODY: ???While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects. ??Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.'' ??Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations to carry his remarks live. ??California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs. ??On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency power. The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said. ??Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California this year. ??A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. It would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold it at much higher rates. ??''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said. ??Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected industry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generators from building new power plants in California. ??''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can to increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price. Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said. ??Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that manner, ''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only things companies understand is leverage.'' ??For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities. ??The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. They argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped utilities. HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens BODY: ??LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California gathered Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's energy crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch spoke, the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly. ??""I don't have any control over this,"" the beleaguered technician operating the sound system called out after repeated outages. ??""I feel your pain,"" Lynch replied with a smile. ??No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackouts that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from consumer groups. ??But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. She promised to lead ""a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out of

The following is a press release from Assembly Member Ellen Corbett regarding her new windfall profits tax bill ABX 128 which will probably be heard in committee following the Easter break. For Immediate Release Contact:    Rebecca Nieto April 4, 2001 (916) 319-2018 Corbett Introduces Windfall Profits Tax Measure SACRAMENTO =01) Responding to increasing electricity rates and the continuing threat of rolling blackouts, Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee Chair Ellen Corbett (D-San Leandro) today introduced a windfall profits tax measure intended to help restore sanity to the pricing of electricity in California.  The bill, AB 128X, imposes an electrical power generation windfall profits tax on the windfall profits realized by power generators, their affiliates, and the middlemen who participate in California's energy market. However, in recognition of the fact that some generators are cooperatively working with the state by holding their costs down, the measure is targeted at generators whose gross receipts significantly exceed the cost these entities incur to produce the energy they sell. ""We cannot continue to pay the exorbitant rates that are currently being charged in today's marketplace.  Consumers and small businesses are seeing their energy rates skyrocket.  The state is spending $45 million per day to help meet demand.  We are looking toward a summer of rolling blackouts.  Yet, we continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state.  This profiteering must stop, and AB 128X will help us ensure 
April 4 , 2001 Interested in subscribing to the Forecast? ? UCLA FORECASTERS SEE NATIONAL RECESSION AS INEVITABLE IN 2001; CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE IMMUNE, WITH BAY AREA VERY SUSCEPTIBLE ? LOS ANGELES --Economists with the UCLA Anderson Business Forecast see even more clear indicators of a recession for the nation in 2001 and project a 90 percent chance that the nation's longest economic expansion will come to an end no later than the first quarter of 2002. ""The year 2001 is a transition year that will take the U.S. economy from the Internet Rush of 1996-2000 to a lower level of sustainable economic growth in 2002,"" said Edward Leamer, UCLA Anderson Business Forecast director and Anderson School professor. However, getting from here to there will involve some painful adjustments, he warns, and ""monetary medicine"" from the Fed won't stop the pain this time. According to the econometric model used by UCLA's forecasters, the probability of a 2001 recession has increased nearly 30 percent since December 2000. Just three months ago, Dr. Leamer's forewarning of a recession was the most pessimistic -- and, as it turns out, the most accurate forecast made that quarter. ""The expansion of 1999-2000 was driven by 'New Economy' investment opportunities. Firms rushed pell-mell to be the first kid on the block to have a cool website. Fear was a big motivator.

Poll thus far: Aron Thomas (AES) just decided not to file.  He made the decision after talking to Edison, who told him that Edison is going to suggest in its filing that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the PX credit; thus, ESPs would pay, but then get it back through the credit (can you say ""poor quality receivables""?).  Aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work shops and the Commission should not decide it in the policy phase. Bill Booth (CLECA) is going to remain silent on the issue because he doesn't know what the position of his members is. Keith McCrae (CMA) is going to say that 1) the surcharge should not apply to direct acces customers and 2) the governor stated publicly that he supports direct access. Jeanne's checking with the Industrial Users Group to see what they're going to say.  Since CMA is going to ask for clarification, I would suggest that we remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues, e.g., equity, no cross subsidies. Thoughts? I let you know what I hear back from Jeanne. Best,

Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power to the state, a U.S. court rules. By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton BEE STAFF WRITERS (Published April 6, 2001) In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state without guarantee of payment. State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant off-line for maintenance. On March 21, citing ""rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California landscape,"" U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators. Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found

Pacific Gas and Electric Company Files for Chapter 11 Reorganization Business Wire 04/06/01, 12:34p (Copyright , 2001, Business Wire) SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 6, 2001--Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the utility unit of PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG), today filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in San Francisco bankruptcy court. The company said it is taking this action in light of its unreimbursed energy costs which are now increasing by more than $300 million per month, continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company, and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray Davis and his representatives are going nowhere. Neither PG&E Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries, including its National Energy Group, have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization or are affected by the utility's filing. ""We chose to file for Chapter 11 reorganization affirmatively because we expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution, which

This statement is by Edison International Chairman, President, and CEO John Bryson. ROSEMEAD, Calif., April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- This is a sad day for California. PG&E has had a proud history of service to our state for more than a century. We at Southern California Edison continue to believe that working out a comprehensive solution to our current crisis is a preferable course to take. PG&E's decision today does not change our position.

FYI, I've faxed PG&E's filing to Rick Shapiro.  If others don't have it and want it, let me know and I'll fax it.  The filing's brief--about 10 pages--with more detail apparently to be filed.  It lists the top 20 creditors.  The only ENE listing in the filing is ENE Canada at $28M. The other thing that Governor and his PUC could have done many months ago was realign rates to more accurately reflect the real cost of power.  That arguably was a key determinant driving PG&E to Bankruptcy. Jeff Eric Thode 04/06/2001 01:37 PM 
I have returned a call to Gary Gentile from the AP.  I gave him this statement and refused further comments on other issues, which included 1) ""what is Enron's actual exposure?"", 2) ""what was Enron's opinion of Gov. Davis' speech last night?"", and 3) ""was this PG&E's only option?""  I did respond to one follow-up question, which was ""what options were available months ago?""  My answer included the following 1) demand side solutions, 2) allowing long-term contracting for power supplies, and 3) expediting the siting process for new supplies. Eric Karen Denne 04/06/2001 01:17 PM 
It's unfortunate that the state's largest utility was forced to turn to the courts for a resolution.  Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive action. Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on our financial condition. If pressed:  Any further comment would be speculative, as we have not yet seen the filing.

Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit. 04/06/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously described as an internal redeployment of staff. Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal computers. ""The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are required for technical positions,"" she said. The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than expected, she said. However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue entertainment-on-demand services actively. Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron units, although there could be some involuntary terminations. Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment there. The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and telecommunications stocks in particular. On Friday it was up 95 cents at $56.65. Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and electricity trading operation. Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter, exceeding the total for all of 2000. Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to fill some other positions. 
This thing's been floating around the web for a while.  Show's what's wrong with good ol' California.  To wit: We want federal water subsidies so we can kill the fish and grow rice and grapefruit in the desert (""and we'll keep it all for us?""). Let's drive our freakin' gas-guzzlin' SUVs all over, but hey, who needs to invest in roads; and somebody else come quick and clean up our air from all those emissions. And we're 49th in the nation for spending on education.  Great stuff. Now, we've decided we want other state's with less sophisticated people (in places like Nevada, Montana, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico) to build power plants (and pollution) in their states to feed electricity, and dam their rivers and kill their salmon so that we can heat our hot tubs and STILL pay 3 cents a kilowatt hour. And oh, by the way, it's federal taxes and the military industrial complex which has funded CA's weapons industry and communications industry.  As no big fan of the military industrial comples, I'm just crying crocodile tears. Generally the kind of self-righteous doo-doo that turns people off to what is an otherwise great place to be. Yours in tender diatribes, Jeff PS Scott, I think that you're absolutely right:  drilling in the Arctic Refuge in good for America.... ""Scott Laughlin"" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 04/06/2001 03:12 PM 
Hope this doesn't piss Jeff off too much... America has engaged in some finger wagging lately because California doesn't have enough electricity to meet its needs. The rest of the country (including George W. Bush's energy secretary Spencer Abraham, who wants Californians to suffer through blackouts as justification for drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) seems to be just fine with letting Californians dangle in the breeze without enough power to meet their needs. They laugh at Californians' frivolity. Well, everybody. Here's how it really is: California ranks 48th in the nation in power consumed per person. California grows more than half the nation's fruit, nuts and vegetables. We're keeping them. We need something to eat when the power goes out. We grow 99 percent or more of the nation's almonds, artichokes, dates, figs, kiwi fruit, olives, persimmons, pistachios, prunes, raisins and walnuts. Hope you won't miss them. California is the nation's number one dairy state. We're keeping our dairy products. We'll need plenty of fresh ones since our refrigerators can't be relied upon. Got milk? We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in state. Silicon Valley is ours, after all. Without enough electricity, which you're apparently keeping for yourselves, we just plain don't have enough software to spare. We're keeping all our airplanes. California builds a good percentage of the commercial airliners available to fly you people to where you want to go. When yours wear out, you'd better hope Boeing's Washington plant can keep you supplied. There isn't enough electricity here to allow us to export any more planes than we need ourselves. And while we're at it, we're keeping all our high-tech aerospace stuff, too, like the sophisticated weapons systems that let you sleep at night, not worried you might wake up under the rule of some foreign kook. [As opposed to some domestic kook] Oh, yeah, and if you want to make a long-distance call, remember where the satellite components and tracking systems come from. Maybe you could get back in the habit of writing letters. Want to see a blockbuster movie this weekend? Come to California. We make them here. Since we'll now have to make them with our own electricity, we're keeping them. Even if we shot them somewhere else, the labs, printing facilities, editing facilities, and sound facilities are all here. Want some nice domestic wine? We produce over 17 million gallons per year. We'll need all of it to drown our sorrows when we think about the fact that no matter how many California products we export to make the rest of America's lives better, America can't see its way clear to help us out with a little electricity. You can no longer have any of our wine. You all complain that we don't build enough power plants. Well, you don't grow enough food, write enough software, make enough movies, build enough airplanes and defense systems or make enough wine. This is your last warning, America. Lighten (us) up before it's too late. Love, The Californians _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com

Hill, International President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), issued the following statement. ""Pacific Gas and Electric's filing for bankruptcy could make a dire situation in California even worse. On behalf of the 13,500 IBEW Local Union 1245 members employed by PG&E and the public they serve, we believe it is imperative that constructive action be taken now. ""Specifically, we call on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to stop dragging its feet and impose price controls on the wholesale electricity market in California. It is obvious that price gouging by wholesale suppliers has bled dry the investor-owned utilities and precipitated this crisis. The state has purchased power in an effort to prop up the system, but it too has paid the same inflated prices. This only threatens California's budget surplus and places an unfair burden on taxpayers while doing nothing to address the root of the problem. ""We also believe that it is time for government and industry to work together to jump start projects to improve the interconnected transmission grid in the Western states so that power can be quickly and efficiently moved to where it is needed. Prompt action on such projects could have helped alleviate the current problems, and they should commence with all due speed. ""Another factor that has driven the crisis is the lack of adequate generation facilities to power the growth of California and other Western states. We urge the Western Governors Association to take the lead in helping to chart a course that will bring more facilities on line and provide short and long term solutions to these difficulties. ""Even though we have been assured that PG&E employees will still be paid, and we know that their pensions are protected by law, we will fight to ensure that our collective bargaining rights are honored during this process. We will work with our Local Union 1245, utility management, Governor Davis and all other parties to restore sanity and reliability to California's gas and

RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY (SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Locker today released the following statement regarding Pacific Gas & Electric's decision to file for bankruptcy: ""The uncontrolled increase in electricity prices by generators and marketers has claimed another victim with the bankruptcy of one of California's oldest businesses. While this is a significant and unwelcome development, our team of bankruptcy litigators has been preparing for several months to defend California taxpayers in the event of a utility bankruptcy. This morning, I spoke with a PG&E executive, and he personally assured me that the utility will honor its legal obligation to pay the state for its purchase of energy and to repay its renewable energy supplier-creditors (""qualified facilities""). I am prepared to enforce those assurances in the courts to the extent necessary. Over the last several months, our state attorneys have fought hard in the courts to ensure that out-of-state generators continue to deliver adequate electricity and natural gas supplies to Californians in spite of the precarious financial condition of the state's two major utilities. The health and safety of Californians and the future of our economy require that our state not be left holding the bag for greedy business decisions of generators, marketers and utilities. Justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the expense of Californians must pay back what they owe. I will use all the considerable resources of the law to help our policymakers keep the lights on and the bills affordable for every California home and business, to recover California tax and ratepayer dollars that have been illegally or unfairly

""The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San Diego"" (April 2001) PWP-082 by James B. Bushnell and Erin T. Mansur Retail electricity rates in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 2000. Much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate freeze. We examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels in San Diego. We find that average electricity consumption decreased by roughly 55 MW, or 1.6%, between mid-July and the end of August. Demand was reduced by over 6% in the late afternoon and late evening. Because of the uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase, these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that could be achieved through pricing incentives.

computer lab for modeling.  same thing this thursday. Here's some stuff I worked on over the weekend.  OAT's balance sheet and income statement and common-sized.  Haven't put together the cash flow yet. Please take a look.  Really wanted to get something in a file for folks to start looking at so that, together with the materials Anil and Carolyn have pulled together, we can start filling in our assumptions and doing some valuations.  I can do the same for Coke and Pepsi. Take a peek and let's try to discuss by email.  Or I'm up for a conference call tomorrow or Wednesday (or a meeting in person) if you folks are game.

Dear Energy Committee Member - I just spoke with two of Governor Davis' top energy advisors.  As you know, the Governor mentioned the need for a rate increase in his televised address last Thursday night.  While his speech, and corresponding notes, went into some detail on how that increase would impact residential customers, it did not go into great detail on the increase to commercial customers. As you know, the PUC's proposed increase was not at all proportional relative to use by residential and commercial customers, and the corresponding rate increase for each.  SVMG has long argued that some level of increase would probably be necessary, but that any rate increase should be proportional to use.  For instance, since residents use approximately one-third of the power, then residential customers should absorb one-third of the increase (taking into account, of course, the most vulnerable residents), and commercial customers should absorb the two-thirds in a way that is proportional to use. I am encouraged by my phone call with the Governor's advisors, in that they seemed to agree strongly that the PUC proposal was not at all proportional, and seemed to concur that such a disproportional structure would be damaging to California employers.  They are going to send me more details tomorrow (Tuesday) about the Governor's plan, and I will then pass that information along. In the meantime, I hope this limited information helps, and will keep you posted as I learn more. Sincerely, Carl Guardino 
John:  I'm not sure how to read it, but it certainly doesn't seem=20 encouraging.  I'll try to find out more tomorrow. Best, Jef The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern California= =20 Edison Memorandum of Understanding: ? Commitment to Provide Power =01) SCE will keep its current generation pla= nts=20 and other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regulated= =20 cost-of-service basis for 10 years. ? Dedication of Power =01) Edison International will commit the entire outp= ut of=20 Sunrise (one of Edison International=01,s non-regulated generating faciliti= es)=20 to the State on a fixed price basis for 10 years. Phase I of Sunrise is to = be=20 brought online by August 15, 2001. If not brought online by August 15, 2001= ,=20 Edison International shall be assessed a $2 million penalty. ? Transmission Sale =01) SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets= for=20 approximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets),= =20 subject to certain adjustments. Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion gain= =20 on sale, will be used to reduce SCE=01,s net undercollected amount as of Ja= nuary=20 31, 2001. In connection with the purchase, the State will also assume certa= in=20 liabilities associated with the transmission assets. ? Backup Transaction =01) If the transmission sale does not occur within tw= o=20 years for reasons beyond the parties=01, control, then if the State elects,= SCE=20 shall sell to the State SCE=01,s hydro generation assets. If the hydro asse= ts=20 are not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe= r=20 31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall. ? Conservation Property =01) SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easemen= ts to=20 the State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroelectr= ic=20 related lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related=20 lands.  Some of the land may be deeded in fee. ? Contribution by Edison International =01) Edison International will refun= d to=20 SCE not less than $400 million.  This money will consist of a refund of=20 approximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus=20 approximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings. ? Investment =01) Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3= =20 billion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE. ? Litigation =01) SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings a= nd=20 filed rate doctrine cases. ? CPUC Regulation =01) CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical= =20 principles of ratemaking. ? Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off =01) SCE shall pay an amount that=20 represents that portion of the net short from January 18, 2001 to April 1,= =20 2001 that is attributable to QF=01,s not selling to SCE (due to SCE=01,s fa= ilure to=20 pay the QF=01,s).  SCE will securitize this amount. ? Securitization =01) SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amou= nt=20 (approx. $3.5 billion).  The securitization shall occur in two tranches (i.= e.=20 two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components). ? The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the=20 signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected= =20 amount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in the= =20 net undercollected amount. ? The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not= =20 occur within two years.  Accordingly, the second tranche would not show up = in=20 rates for two years, if at all. ? Buying the Net Short =01) The State will be required to buy the net short= =20 through December 31, 2002.  After 2002 SCE will be responsible for covering= =20 the net short. ? Investment Recovery =01) SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that= will=20 not drop below its current rte (11.6%) during the 10 year cost of service= =20 ratemaking period. ? Next Steps (Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action): ? Definitive Agreements =01) Once the MOU is signed, the next stage is to= =20 negotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the=20 transmission sale, as well as the specific terms of the various other relat= ed=20 agreements (e.g., the O&M Agreement, Transmission Services Agreement and th= e=20 Facilities Services Agreement). ?

Jeff, Is it possible for TW to get a copy of the Edison filing at the CPUC?  While the article [shown below] doesn't provide any details, I suspect Edison's complaint echoes earlier allegations against El Paso regarding their sale of the 1.2 Bcf/d block of capacity to their affiliate.  I don't think Transwestern and/or Enron affiliate marketing companies are implicated in this deal at all. Can you confirm this is an ""El Paso only"" problem and not something Enron is being drawn into?  I really appreciate your help here.

Edison Reach An Agreement 
Here's how I think this thing has played (is playing) out: PG&E was very tactical. They knew that the Edison deal was imminent. They see the Edison deal as extremely adverse to their interests. They feared that the pressure on them to do the same deal would be enormous once the Governor announced the Edison deal. Thus, in an incredibly dramatic attempt to pre-empt the possibility that they'd have to accept the Edison deal, PG&E threw itself into bankruptcy. (Preemption seems to have been very successful, at least at this point.) So I think that they wanted everyone to know, including Wall Street and the Governor, that the decision's been made---they're going the way of Ch. 11, not the way of J. Bryson and Edison. This make sense? Best, Jeff Karen Denne 04/10/2001 10:22 AM

Steve Kean will be in San Diego for the electricity hearing on the 11th.  Can either of you suggest a hotel in close proximity to the hearing site?  It will be held at the County Adminstration Center Building, 1600 Pacific Highway in San Diego.  Thanks. 
Here are the components as I see them: 1999 numbers for C&I are fine; I'd do 10%, 15%, 20% reductions. Assume C&I takes its proportionate share of the DWR's net short (i.e., if C&I is 2/3 of load, then 2/3 of CDW purchases should go to C&I) You can use the average price used in the DWR presentation to Legislators to the $ amount.  The copy I've got sez that the average price for the first 5 years is $79/MWH.  That seems like the # we ought to use. Now the hard part.  The state reportedly sez that they aren't buying the entire net short---only that part that they feel like covering.  So how do we factor that in?  Not sure that we can get detailed data (but check with Alan Comnes, who might be able to provide ISO real time prices (which is where the net short (of the net short) is being filled ISO---the ISO then sends that bill to PG&E. An easier way might be to use PG&E's numbers.  In their bankruptcy announcement, PG&E sez that it's been costing them $300MM per month ($300MM * 0.67 * 0.10 =~$20MM).  We could scale this number up to account for summer purchases. Alternatively, we could use ENA's forward curve. This is very quick and dirty (apologies) and I may have gotten something very wrong.  If I've got any fatal flaws in the thinking (which happens often), please point them out.  And if you have any questions, don't hesitate. Best, Jeff Jennifer Thome 04/10/2001 12:17 PM

In Idaho, Western states press feds to act on power prices H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer Tuesday, April 10, 2001 ,2001 Associated Press URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2001/04/10/nation al1812EDT0713.DTL (04-10) 18:04 PDT BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- High electricity prices pose a ``looming disaster'' for many states in the West, a federal regulator warned Tuesday, as pressure grew on the government to consider temporary price controls on wholesale power. Officials from 11 Western states, including energy-ravaged California, engaged in sometimes passionate exchanges with three members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over how to contain soaring power prices that are expected to go only higher this summer. ``Something has to be done to tame this market,'' Geoffrey Brown, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission, told the three FERC commissioners. California anticipates paying $65 billion for electricity this year, almost 10 times its power bill in 1999. But after the daylong session, the FERC seemed to be not much closer to imposing price caps than before, although one commissioner, Linda Breathitt, said she now wants to look the issue more carefully and might be swayed. FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, a strong free-market advocate, reiterated his fear that price regulation would drive off investors for new power generation. Under FERC rules, it would be Hebert's discretion when or if to propose a price cap for deliberation. Commissioner William Massey, who has been in the minority on the commission in recommending price controls, said the ``passion for markets must be tempered with common sense.'' ``We face a looming disaster,'' he declared, if wholesale electricity markets are allowed to continue on a path that has wholesale power in many parts of the West selling for 10 times what it cost just a year ago. Hebert insisted that the FERC ``is doing everything it can'' to ensure just and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action to seek $124 million in refunds on California power sales. He also said the commission plans soon to approve a new system of tracking market abuses. The chairman noted that state officials at the meeting were sharply divided over whether the government should regulate electricity prices. Keeping tabs as each participant gave a presentation, he said three states were for them, five against and three uncertain. Hebert's anti-controls position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney in a telephone interview with Associated Press reporter David Ammons in Olympia, Wash. ``The problem with price caps,'' Cheney said, ``is that they don't solve the problem. Just look at California, where they had caps applied at the retail level that, coupled with the requirement to buy power on the spot market, has driven PG&E into bankruptcy.'' Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, said last week it had debts of $9 billion and filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. California, whose electricity problems have unleashed soaring power prices throughout the West, urged FERC to immediately impose an 18-month cost-based price cap in the Western markets. ``We have done our part. We cannot do it alone,'' said Bob Hertzberg, speaker of the California Assembly. He cited state actions to boost conservation, increase retail rates and speed up power plant construction and said there is ``no earthly reason'' why energy prices should be 10 times what they were a year ago. Still, California officials expressed little optimism after the hearing. ``It would take a dramatic, unprecedented change of direction'' for the FERC to adopt price controls, said Fred Keeley, speaker pro tem in the California Assembly, who was in the audience during the six-hour meeting. Breathitt, the FERC's third commissioner, who has not come out in favor of price caps, nevertheless indicated she might be inching toward some controls. She said she wants the commission to ``seriously discuss a price implementation plan.'' The issue may end up, however, being decided by two new commissioners recently nominated by President Bush -- Pat Wood, now head of the Texas utility commission, and Nora Brownell, a Pennsylvania regulator. Both are viewed as free market advocates, but pro-controls commissioner Massey said he believes they might be swayed to accept temporary price restraints if the electricity market reels further out of control. Neither nominee has yet been confirmed by the Senate. While divided on price controls, most of the state officials at the unusual FERC meeting expressed worries that the federal agency was doing too little to address problems in the power markets. The chairman of Montana's utility commission, Gary Feland, who opposes price controls, criticized FERC for lack of aggressiveness in challenging unreasonable prices. FERC is legally mandated to ensure ``just and reasonable'' wholesale power prices. ``Montana is taking a hell of a hit'' from electricity prices, Feland said. ``Politically we're getting beat up.'' Steve Ellenbecker, a utility commissioner from Wyoming, urged the federal regulators to come up with a ``reasonable measure'' short of a price cap to deal with the troubled electricity market. Many of the state officials said the full impact of the high wholesale power prices have yet to hit consumers. In many cases state officials must still give permission for utilities to pass them on to retail customers. On the Net: FERC Web site: www.ferc.fed.us/

Michael: Do we know who from Enron will actually be on the committee? Best, Jeff Karen Denne 04/11/2001 09:29 AM 
fyi... 
FYI. 
I reviewed the Cal ISO filings below (in Sue's note) to determine general consistency with FERC orders on interconnection procedures.  Potential issues are identified below and you all can decide if Enron should protest/intervene (the West Developers may want to review this too).   Since I am not familiar with the Cal ISO procedures, I cannot determine whether protest is necessary (for example, PJM, NY, and NEPOOL have certain interconnection policies that would not be acceptable outside the pool, but that work ok for the pool). The TOs have also filed Amend. 39 interconnection procedures, but I have not looked at those to see if they mirror these.  Maybe one of the paralegals could check that.  In addition, one of you should review the filing letter and procedures to make sure that the statements made by Cal ISO are correct. (Filing letter) The Cal ISO states that these procedures are filed in response to FERC's orders and that the Cal ISO and Market Participants are examining policies that will ensure that the ISO Controlled Grid is expanded to support competitive markets.  It also states that it would have liked to propose complementary changes to its long-term planning and expansion process, but other priorities have prevented it from doing so. Discusses the two previously methodologies regarding interconnection procedures -- ""No Grandfathering of Transmission Rights"" and ""Advance Congestion Cost Mitigation"" (which was apparently rejected last year. (Filing Letter at 10) -- Cal ISO does not propose a method of sharing upgrade costs, but states that the procedures do not preclude such a provision.  This is one we have used in other Inter. Agreements:  If required by law or if the Parties mutually agree to allow one or more third parties to use the Interconnection Facilities or any part thereof (whether by transfer of the Interconnection Facilities to an RTO or otherwise) and such use decreases the capacity of the Interconnection Facilities available to TO or the Facility or otherwise causes any detriment to TO or the Facility or benefits any party (including TO) other than Generator, or if TO is compensated for the costs of the Interconnection Facilities (in whole or in part) for any reason, Generator will be entitled to compensation from TO based upon the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO, all third party users, and Generator, for the greater of (i) whatever costs Generator incurred in connection with the Interconnection Facilities, plus interest at the Interest Rate from the date of Generator's payment of the costs in connection with the Interconnection Facilities and (ii) the value that TO receives for the Interconnection Facilities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Parties may use any other mutually agreed upon methodology to determine such compensation. 3.3 If one or more third parties are to use the Interconnection Facilities in accordance with Section ___, Generator's obligation to reimburse TO for the operation and maintenance costs incurred by TO in connection with the Interconnection Facilities shall be based on the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO, all third parties users, and Generator, or on some other mutually agreed upon methodology; provided, however, that, under no circumstances shall Generator's share of TO's operation and maintenance costs be greater than its pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities. (Procedures) The timelines for submitting applications and responding to system impact studies (SIS) and facilities study (FS) are fine, per previous FERC orders (in fact, Cal ISO asks for 60 days to complete the Facilities Study -- PGE just filed requesting 90 days). 5.7.3.1.1.(c)  I would add ""on a non-discriminatory basis"" after ""unless

Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universities Updated: April 11, 2001 - 2:06 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach of contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide by its agreement to sell cheap power to the state's public universities. Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a four-year deal with the California State University and University of California systems. Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on the market, said the contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a month because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices. Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers should pick up the tab. ""It's our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of dollars we can provide it for,"" Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said. He

You got it.  I'll put my thinking cap on and start pondering. Best, Jeff James D Steffes 04/11/2001 05:51 PM 
NETWORK In discussions with the Administration, it has become clear that there would be great political value in being able to  demonstrate (a) the economic value of open access for the US and (b) the impact open access would have on the current energy crisis. Enron has developed historical analysis of the impact of deregulation on natural gas.  Margaret Carson is putting together some slides that show (1) throughput improvements, (2) expansion in pipeline capacity, and (3) cost reductions in the industry.  While not exactly identical, there are some good reasons to assume that the same would occur in the electricity industry. It would be great if you could develop a general qualitative framework that would outline why open access is preferable in the very short-term and work on a larger quantitative framework over the medium-term. To that end, Richard Tabors of TCA had earlier analyzed the economic loss from AEP's abuse of its transmission network last year.  He may have additional insights into developing this concept.

FYI:  I listened in on the analyst call.  Bryson made it very clear that, under the agreement, Edison would re-assume the procurement role on 12.31.02 and would ""administer"" (i.e., takeover) the DWR contracts.  Seems pretty clear that the State is actively looking for a strategy to exit the procurement role. Best, Jeff James D Steffes 04/12/2001 10:36 PM 
Not sure if you had seen this information.  Looks like if the SCE deal is approved, SCE would assume CDWR contracts. Jim 
SCE held a conference call this morning to discuss the  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) related to the sale of its transmission assets with members of the investment community.  After a  brief description of major provisions of the MOU, questions were taken.  Following is a summary of that call. Major Components of Plan (repeatedly referred to as the ""Governor's Plan"") Maintains cost-of-service treatment for utility retained generation for 10 years Sale of transmission assets (or other assets) to CDWR Dedication of the ""Sunrise"" generation project to cost-of-service based rates for 10 years ($2 mm penalty if not on-line by August) Provision of easements and potential conveyances in fee of certain lands (at two hydro projects) Provides for full recovery of $3.5 B utility net underrecovery as of 1/31/01 Commits SCE to spend $3 B in capital expenditures over 5 years Dismissal of federal lawsuits by SCE SCE will resume traditional utility procurement obligations by 1/1/03, assuming CDWR contracts and entering into new purchase contracts as necessary It was stressed that the MOU was a comprehensive plan to be treated as an integrated package.  While the CPUC and members of the legislature were involved in various stages of the negotiation, the agreement is technically between SCE and CDWR.  Various regulatory and legislative approvals are necessary for implementation of the MOU.  SCE has rights to terminate the MOU if the CPUC  has not adopted specified ""implementing decisions"" within 60 days.  Legislation necessary to implement certain provisions of the MOU must be passed by August 15. For ratemaking purposes the CPUC will grant SCE a 11.6% ROE on its generation and distribution rate base. Questions and Answers What was expected timing of return to investment grade for SCE? Up to the rating agencies.  Many steps to go through.  It is assumed agencies will be following closely but timing is uncertain.  Would have to be before utility resumes power procurement obligations. Applicability of 11.6% ROE? ROE would increase from current 7% ROE to level no less than 11.6% for both generation and distribution assets on unamortized balance at 12/31/00 and capital structure roughly at 50/50. Potential for write-offs? While plan calls for full recovery of net undercollections as of 1/31/01, because of timing issues SCE may take a write-off then have a ""write-up"" at a later date. Interest in how/why/impact of inclusion of Mission Sunrise generation project (investor concern over market v. regulated returns)? The state was looking at all options for long-term power contracts.  Market returns traded for security of long-term contract. What will be source for $3 b capital investments over next 5 years? Capital would come from retained earnings, borrowing and additional investments from holding company. Concern over ability of existing rate level (and ""waterfall"" disbursement) to recover all costs especially if CDWR procurement costs increase? Existing rates should cover all costs.  Provisions in MOU allow adjustment to rates to maintain investment grade status. What was gained from MOU as opposed to pursuit through the courts? Speed and certainty with respect to resolution of outstanding issues. Will the sale be a taxable event? Yes. What is the URG unit cost? $.042 per kwH. In 2003 would SCE have ability to replace contracts of CDWR (when SCE resumes procurement role)? SCE would have ability to enter into new contracts, but would not ignore obligations under CDWR contracts.  New contracts would be subject to PUC prudence review.  SCE would file procurement plan with the PUC.

Sorry, been on calls.  Just got your message.  From my perspective, you got it exactly right in the note.  If you have any additional questions, just holler. Best, 
As I feared, Belden's on vacation this week.  I've left a message with him to call, however.  Will let you know just as soon as (and if) I hear anything. Best,

04/12/2001 05:44 PM I would love for you to meet our new VP of Professional Services (who is, incidentally, now for all intents and purposes running our company).  I think you will love him.  He is very interested in the idea of working with Enron and I want you to meet him.  Can we set up a dinner for the three of us sometime in the next couple weeks?  I know your schedule is busy with school, so why don't you tell me a couple nights that work (other than Mondays) and I will make it work on our end.  Please oh please. Love, Your Pal Cameron P.S.

Were you on the call yesterday---I went ballistic.  And where are you now!?! The calls underway. Karen Denne 04/13/2001 12:45 PM 
I get so worked up over this issue...  I really think now is the time to speak up and dissent.  Skilling told us at a floor meeting that as an organization we've made poor decisions in the past, and he believes it's because the people who disagreed with those decisions never spoke up.  So help me out! Sent by: Jeff Dasovich

Jeff, Sue & Harry -- Michael and I are both in SF on Monday evening.  We were talking about getting together some time in the evening to put together a framework of our case around the Negative CTC in ""bankruptcy"" terms. Does everyone agree and does the time work? Jim 
Ralph: Thanks.  Really looking forward to discussing further.  The proposal is very promising.  As you can imagine, Enron's going to have two concerns:  1) ensuring that eligibility for participating in the competition is as broad as possible (paragraph #1), and 2) ensuring that the ""terms specified by the Commission that will ptrotect the regulated service and its other customers from financial harm"" don't unintentionally (or otherwise) have the effect of killing direct access (like AB 1890 did). Appreciate you sharing this.  You can count on Enron's support.  (Though I understand that Enron's support these days is not the most sought after commodity---I leave that up to your judgment.  We'll be prepared to help in away way you see fit.) Have a nice weekend.

Nice move.  She's a good find.  How much is the finder's fee? Susan Scott/ENRON@enronXgate 04/13/2001 03:00 PM 
As some of you might already have heard, I will move to Enron Corp. Government Affairs on April 30.  My primary responsibility will be to advise the power traders on regulatory and other matters.  While it will be difficult to leave, I know this is a good opportunity for me.  Thank all of you for your encouragement, advice and support; this is a great group and I will miss working with you. 
CLFP proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company. CLFP proposes the Commission establish an optional summer on-peak, peak period consisting of a continuous 3-hour period during the current summer on-peak period for both utilities.  The 3-hour period would be selected by the customer.  Specifically: Service Eligibility:  Customers served as medium or large commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered accordingly.  Examples - PG&E's E-19, E-20, etc. and SCE's TOU-8, etc. Customer Eligibility:  Electric customers processing, handling, distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products.  (As noted below, since no revenue shift occurs within the class, the Commission may consider opening the option to others.) Customer Charge Surcharge:  A surcharge of $130 per meter per month for the initial summer period (2001) to offset the utilities cost for changes to billing procedures.  In the case of optimal billing period service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period. Optional Summer On-Peak Period:  Any continuous 3-hour period during the summer-on-peak period of time.  Hours may be designated by the customer consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering capability. The reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many factors involved in load shedding.  Labor, harvesting schedules and coordination with growers, delivery schedules, inspection activity, etc. All bear upon such an effort. Rate for Optional Summer-On-Peak Period Service:  Energy rates for the 3-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for summer-on-peak energy.  The other 3 hours of the 6-hour on-peak period would be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality. In the event partial peak periods are retained, the rate for the non-optioned 3-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to retain revenue neutrality.  These rates would apply, as now, workdays of Monday - Friday. Notice and Service:  An eligible customer must notify the utility in writing, by fax, email, or hand delivered, to both the appropriate account representative and the customer billing department of the request for optional summer-on-peak period service.  The 3-hour period of optional service and the start date for such service shall be specified.  Start dates should coincide with billing cycles, with a minimum of seven days notice prior to such cycle.  Optional optimal billing period customers would be treated accordingly, except as currently provided, a two-day advance notice. Implementation Issues - TOU Meters and Billing.  It appears the number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the total number of meters of the utilities. In response to CLFP's data request by PG&E and SCE (attached) the following is observed. For SCE, SIC 20 (food and kindred products) customers account for approximately 163 meters out of about 10,000 meters.  Of the 163, all but 8 can be managed locally by the Customer Data Acquisition System.  The 8 would appear to require a field visit. For PG&E, out of 11,675 TOU meters on E-19 and E-20 service, 354 or 3% of the total are SIC 20.  Of the 354 nearly half, 175, are hourly interval meters.  The remaining 179 presumably would need a field visit for reprogramming. Conclusion:  Based upon the data supplied, metering and billing changes required by an optional summer on-peak period program for processors of perishable commodities, there does not seem, in CLFP's opinion, to be a

Scott -- Can your assistant get a call in # for those in CA? Jim Scott Stoness@EES 04/13/2001 12:00 PM 
We have agreed on a strategy, subject to Whaley/Delaney approval, to: Scott Stoness submit testimony today advocating 2 part real time pricing in CA Read other parties testimony this weekend from the perspective ""Has somebody filed testimony close enough to Stoness testimony, that we can cross examine 
Dudes: Here's my my comments to Mark's answers to the questions, and suggestions to Jimmie's model.  I don't answer the bottom line question, since we have some talking to do on the model. Jimmie, your model is great except we have to value the company on cash flow (as opposed to NI).  I've take a stab at setting up the discounted cash flow model.  All my stuff is highlighted in yellow. It's the capex that's screwy (see assumptions given in questions).  I get at 25% of 1995 revs, not 45.8% as indicated in the assumptions. I also assume that when it sez working capital is net zero, we don't factor those balance sheet line items into the DCF model.  Others agree? Anyway, it gives me a $3.32 share value, so I think the model's got some work.  Take a look and let me know what you think. Best, Jeff 
Guess I was lazier still.  Agree with your assessment, I just neglected to recalc your model in order to determine growth rates necessary to get cash flows high enough to justify $14 and $28.  31% and 40% growth rates are (I would argue) wildly unrealistic.  In addition, the capex numbers would (presumably) have to bump up substantially in order to get you there. Therefore, I would argue in the memo that the numbers don't add up for a $28 price (though ""irrational exuberance"" may permit Netscape to pull it off). Unless other folks have comments on the model, I think you're good to go for the memo.  Am ready to look at it when you've got a draft.  Great job on the case.  Thanks. Best, Jeff JcjCal02@aol.com 04/14/2001 11:16 PM 
Jeff, You're obviously right about discounting cash flow.  I was getting a little lazy.  The capital exp in Exhibit 3 in the book is close to what you have in the model.  I agree about your working capital assumption.  I guess I'm not clear on your conclusion. The $3+ you calculated a share is based on 16% growth.  We are being asked to calculate what growth justifies $28/share.  I calculate 31% growth for $14/share and about 40% growth for $28 per share. Reality is their immediate growth is probably going to be higher than both numbers but would not be sustainable for 10 years. Anyway while we bat this around, I've begun putting some bullshit into the memo.  I guess I vote we double the price.  The other IPO in Exhibit 6 (especially Uunet) demonstrate how hot the high tech IPO market is.  IPOs are a lot about emotion and maybe a little about cash flow.  What's the down side if the offering doesn't sell well.  Netscape has a very hot business they should extract a high price for the potential gold mind they offer (this is my 1999 thinking, not 2000).  Comments? Jimmy

OK folks.  It's about 80% of the way there.  My brains are oozing out looking at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well.  I'll continue to check it and de-bug it.  Mark, you and I should talk, too.  (You'll note that at this point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to do.)  Apologies in advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there). If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know. I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to start getting the power point presentation together.  And perhaps we should think about meeting this weekend? In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios, including Dupont, for OAT. Does this work for folks?  Other thoughts? Best,

Apologies.  My dead just fell into a million pieces.

We'll be at the party, Overture, or no Overture. The Squaw thing ain't a problem.  No worries.  But let's settle soon.  My accounts are a little wacky these days---I'll explain later.  Thanks for letting me know. With the playing, there's a lot of little issues that I think are no big deal, but from our weekend at Squaw, it seems that there are some major fucking huge issues that you and the mighty C needed to work out.  If you've got those worked out, then I'm all fer playing again, though the next 2-3 weeks are pretty fucking ugly. Best, Jeff ""Scott Laughlin"" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 04/16/2001 12:00 PM 
All, I hope you guys can come this Friday to the dinner party at Sarah's house. It will be the four of us, Kent, Allison, Bobby, Sarah, and one of Sarah's friends called Mari, who was at the post-Hillman rock party. (Riddles is in La Paz, Mexico, being the smart guy that he is.) I have conceptualized the menu personally--hopefully Cameron and Sarah can carry it out. Also, I think there'll be a case of Overture. If that doesn't entice you, I don't know what will. I would really love it if you guys could be there. 31 is no big deal beyond an excuse to get dead fucked up... I also checked into the Squaw fiasco, and I hate to report that all that was charged to my card was a measly $24.61. So, we'll have to discuss the settling of that bill. Sorry for the inconvenience, Jeff. At the risk of sounding too much like Nancy... I think it would be nice if we could try to play music again. I picked up the damn mandolin so that I could actually play, not just practice in my room all alone! I know that there are many issues that arise between all of us, but maybe we can talk about them individually and together, and then try to simply be more mellow, have more fun. That doesn't mean that we can't ""practice;""  however everything must be done in the spirit of enjoyment. All this is pretty obvious to all of us, and I don't need any of you to address this issue in e-mail, but we've had a lot of good times playing together, and I would like us to rise above this and move ahead, and perhaps get to a better place. After all, summer is on the way, and we want to be able to impress our teachers and mentors. I think of poor Bridget having to sit through the same show we gave her last year. What will she say to Ed!? If not, the sidekicks are going to have to go on tour. I love you all and hope this finds you well, Scotty

Prentice and I talked.  She's going to come back from the sports gig for the dinner party.  Don't worry to much about the ganged-up-on-thing---Prentice is cool.  She's ready to play.  She and I have been playing together (though our respective repertoires, as designed by Avram, diverge more than they converge).  We're getting pretty hot on Earl's breakdown, though. P.S. Comes a point in one's life (like, when you're an adult), that you take personal responsibility for your actions---""my dad made me do it"" must simply give way.  And ""my dad made me an exquisite perfectionist"" must REALLY really give way. Best, Jeff ""Scott Laughlin"" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 04/16/2001 01:37 PM 
Thanks for the nice e-mail. I hope you can make the party. Cameron just told me that Prentice has some sports thing happening; hopefully Friday's activities aren't too pressing. As far as the music, Cameron is going to try to shed that Nazi side of her that has been sort of instilled in her from her dad (or she attributes it to her dad and his perfectionist stance towards music). On the other hand, I am too sensitive to her, so we're both going to try to be very aware of both those things. We've talked about it and realize that we're going to have to get over it in order to enjoy the music. I think if she's more mellow, then maybe Prentice won't feel so ganged up on? I hope not, anyway. Just give us the total for Squaw, and we'll cut you a check. See you this week, Scott

-FYI.  This is an internal email of the SVMG.  Please keep confidential. I'll be monitoring.  Thanks. Best, Jeff ****************************************************************************** ************************************** As you know, the SVMG Energy Committee plans to discuss variable pricing, specifically Severin Borenstein's proposal, at its next meeting on Monday. A copy of his proposal is attached. As I indicated at last week's meeting, I believe the SVMG should consider endorsing the proposal, with certain conditions, for the following reasons: - It provides the broadest, most transparent incentive to reduce consumption precisely during hours of shortage, thereby reducing the chances of involuntary curtailments (blackouts). - It creates a demand response to high prices, thereby reducing the market power enjoyed by power sellers. This may be one of the only factors contributing to a more reasonable, stable wholesale price environment if there is no federal intervention. - It offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce their demand overall or shift their demand to off-peak periods. The following is a ""strawman"" draft of an endorsement by SVMG for discussion Monday. I would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be interruptible, an issue of concern to some. Also, I hope to have additional input from Barbara Barkovich before Monday's meeting. Thanks. Peter Evans ____________________________ Power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand during specific hours of supply shortage (and high prices). This gives the greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a staggering DWR bill and suffering through frequent blackouts. Getting people to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market power of sellers. We therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above historical levels (and rebate for power use reductions below historical levels) at the real-time energy price. Our support for this concept includes the following conditions: 1. Historical consumption levels, which would be served under regulated rates, would be based on last year's use, taking into account the customer's historical load profile. Adjustments would be made for increases/decreases in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to account for changes in business volume. Historical consumption served under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio (say 75% to 95%) to build in some expectation of conservation. 2. Participation All customer classes would participate. In the absence of real time load data (i.e. residential customers), monthly consumption deviations from historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price. 3. Alternatives for Above-Baseline Use It must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered ability to procure power for their above-historical power requirements on their own if they choose to. This could include self-generation, bilateral forward purchases, or purchasing at the spot price from the DWR. 4. Sunset This approach should automatically terminate at the end of 2001, requiring government or regulatory action to extend it. 
Our schedules make it messy.  I can come over tomorrow during the break if Anil and Carolyn want to meet.  Mark, if you want to hunker down with the model tomorrow, you should feel free.  The only thing about Thursday is that Carolyn's got a commitment with Dian.  Can we talk about meeting this weekend?  I can be flexible.

Model(Document link: 10:52 AM Jeff Dasovich) OK folks. It's about 80% of the way there. My brains are oozing out looking at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well. I'll continue to check it and de-bug it. Mark, you and I should talk, too. (You'll note that at this point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to! do.) Apologies in advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there). If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know. I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to start getting the power point presentation together. And perhaps we should think about meeting this weekend? In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios, including Dupont, for OAT. Does this work for folks?

Agree.  I think she's already gotten a helluvalot better--a marked and very positive change.  Reflection and realization are powerful things. I'll bring all the paperwork over tonite.

You're right on, what you said yesterday about Cameron's taking responsibility for herself, instead of passing off the blame. But, that's exactly why this whole thing has been good for Cameron. She sees this part of her that isn't fair or compassionate, and really wants to change it. Pinning it on her father only makes her see clearly that it isn't healthy. Half the battle is realizing that these are patterns instilled from sources outside, things she needs to correct, and then move away from. We all go through that very difficult process. ""Blame"" needs to arise before one can move beyond into a better place. I think we'll all see her try to be better than she's been. As for the bill, don't you think that's high? One night, the dinner, Cameron's rental, and lift tickets should come to about $500, no? How much was your half? Did they provide you with a break-down of the charges? I don't mean to be a pain, but I don't really trust their methods after this debacle. Cheers, Scott

Hi, all--- You may already know this, but I wanted to keep you updated.  All new commodity (power) business in California has been put on hold.  Yesterday, Eric Letke announced to the team of originators that we would be suspending new efforts until the regulatory/legislative environment is more solid in California. With that news, all of our team meetings and conference calls have been cancelled. However, I want to maintain a weekly call (30 min max) on our own....just to keep-in-touch. I will defer to your schedules. Please tell me what day and hour looks best for you. OR Is there an existing call that we could join? I just don't want to lose focus.

Jeff, My name is Kurt Lindahl.  I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG team.  I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast.  Michael McGarry, from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead Development Engineer on the project. A key question in this effort is, ""Where is the best entry point into the Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems.  In other words, where can we site a LNG terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of facilities they require is minimal?  I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the optimization department in ETS.  He said that if we could get annual flow diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in about 2 weeks time.  Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the CPUC?  That's where I need your help.  This is a hot subject, because the race to site an LNG terminal is intense. Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can discuss.  We want to keep this effort very confidential, so please maintain secrecy. I will also want to talk to you about permitting and state approvals. Regards, Kurt Lindahl

FYI.  Ray NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : April 20, 2001 CA Governor, Regulators Push on, but Legislature Raises Doubts Two certainties prevailed in California's blighted energy landscape Thursday: wholesale power bills are getting bigger and state regulators are trying harder to salvage Gov. Gray Davis' deal with Southern California Edison Co. But in the state legislature from which the ultimate solutions must come there was growing skepticism, despite a series of meetings with the governor earlier in the week. While nervousness over the state's electricity bill and the prospect of insufficient power supplies this summer prevailed, Davis met with 25 members of California's congressional delegation at a Los Angeles airport hotel to press his case for federal actions to resolve the seemingly endless energy dilemma. The California Public Utilities Commission has ordered a statewide investigation of the contractual obligations of the almost 700 small (qualifying facility) QF generators toward the utilities, but most of the five-member commission's activity was focused outside its regular business meeting in San Francisco. CPUC President Loretta Lynch offered empathy toward Edison's financial plight and renewed pleas for federal regulators to provide wholesale price relief. ""I have committed that the CPUC will expeditiously review those provisions of (Edison's proposed agreement) that require CPUC resolution, and I have taken steps to begin that process,"" Lynch said in a prepared statement released Wednesday. ""In the meantime, I commit to reviewing on a priority basis any and all proposals that promote the financial health of California utilities 
We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that the Px credit should be based on DJ-NP15 and DJ-SP15 rather than the defunct Px because AB1890 requires it to be based on market (not costs).  Changing to procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB1890 which requires DA customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers. And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJ-NP15/SP15, that is the only appropriate available method. Further, the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA customers should be charged the generation surcharges ($10 +$30).  DA customers should be given market based Px credits (based on DJNP15/SP15) because its the law.  There are 2 possible interpretations resulting from the combination of AB1890 and the new law. The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any surcharge. The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the $30 + $10 surcharges Interpretation 1 results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other customers.  It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent. Interpretation 2 results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other customers until the end of AB1890.  This seems like the likely interpretation since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB1890.  Thus given that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus $40, they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the rate freeze ends. Once the Px credit ends (Mar 2002), the surcharge should end because the law (AB1890) no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because: Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should not be charged for them. In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value (if the courts interpret the law differently than Enron) then there should be no generation surcharge for DA customers. This is the same argument we should make in our brief on rate setting Scott JBennett <JBennett@GMSSR.com> on 04/20/2001 09:03:06 AM 
As you are aware, SCE made an advice filing on April 5th to eradicate the PX Rate Schedule and Replace it with Schedule PE --Procured Energy.  As part of the filing, SCE proposes to set ""on an interim basis"" the cost of energy procurement, for bundled service customers for billing purposes and in the calculation of the energy credit for direct access customers equal to the Generation rate component of the Customer's otherwise applicable tariff. Two primary issues arise from SCE's statement. First what does ""interim basis"" mean -- how long will this be in effect.  In starts on January 19th, but it is unclear as to when it would end. Second, and most important. is what is meant by the Generation rate component.  While there is not much explanation in the April 5 advice letter, in a subsequent advice letter filed on April 11 (1533-E), SCE set forth ""Rate Schedule Specific Generation Related Rates"" which range between five and nine cents. I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier.  We need to protest the change in the PX credit by Wednesday, April 25th.  All thoughts on the matter are welcome. Jeanne

More recipes.  The other part would be fun to read to everyone at dinner. STRANGOZZI WITH BLACK TRUFFLE Ingredients (4 people): 500 g of fresh hand-made strangozze, 150 g of black valuable truffle, extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, sat, black pepper and parsley. br> Preparation: Fry slightly the extra-virgin oil, the garlic and some parsley. Take the pan off from the stove, filter the spices and mix the other oil with the grated truffle seasoned with salt and black pepper. The pasta must be ""al dente"". Pour the sauce on the pasta and mix it on the stove at light heat for a while, then serve it guarnished with truffles slices. The TRUFFLE history of a typical umbrian product For a lot of people, the word truffle recalls a tuberous entity, marbled on the skin, with a nice scent, tasting delicious and it is usually associated to a good lunch, generously wet by sweet wine; for the botanics, instead, this is just the fruit spreading device of mushrooms wich adapted living in the underground. Since from the beginning truffles interested philosophers and scientists, starting fighting and discussions to whom neither very strict thinkers like Savonarola could avoid to partecipate. It is not so strange then that in the first book scientifically talking about mushrooms which has been printed, the Opusculus de Tuberis di Alfonso Ceccarelli da Bevagna (1564), was about TRUFFLES. Almost 2000 years before the Greek philosopher Teophrastus (370-287 a.C.) turned on the discussion asserting that truffles were vegetables without roots, originated during winter rains, if there were thunders. Strange theory, without doubts. The Romans were really crazy for truffles and the Latin poets Apicious and Giovenal glorified the truffles and their taste, writing also a recipes book. During the middle age it was the king on the refined tables of every king's court. In a document from Baron A. Ancaiani (1761) about the ""active and passive commerce of the town of Spoleto"" huge quantities of truffles sent to Florence and Venice are described. It seems they were really requested. Rossini defined it the Mozart of the kitchen and it is told that Napoleon used huge quantities of the truffle to provide a successor to his kingdom. About its botanic constitution, instead, until the late 18th century the strangest theories continued to be produced. The celeber naturalist Plinio il vecchio considered them as they were ground corns and a miracle. Bornolz (1780) thought they were an intermediate class between the animal and the vegetal kingdoms. Revel, in 1857, said the truffles were the result of a fly bite on a oak root. Just after the second half of 18th century the idea that the truffles were autonomous organisms, or better mushrooms, started to be accepted. Our Umbria keeps a rich ipogeous flora and since centuries is the first country in producing truffles, especially the valuable black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vitt.) spread around the woods around Norcia and Spoleto. The mushroom has always different dimensions and it can vary from the width of a nut to that of an orange and it is very appreciated for the intensity of the smell and the rich taste. The collecting of the tubers happens during the time between December and March. Secondary is, in these same zones, the production of white truffle (Tuber Magnatum Pico) foun in Spoleto nearby valleys, but impressive is the production of summer ""scorzone"" truffle (Tuber aestivum Vitt.) and even of the ""hooked"" truffle (Tuber uncinatum Ch?teau), which have a peculiar taste and smell. what truffles are With the name truffle are designed mushrooms belonging to the order of tuberales (Ascomycetes), because the mushrooms have a vegetal body formed by a white mold (micelius), constituted by thousand of very thin filaments (ife). This mold lives deep into the ground and it physically unites to the roots of several plants, originating a very peculiar symbiosis called ""micorriza"". When the ecolocical conditions are fine, the micelius generates the fructifer bodies which are formed in a variable range of 40-50 cm. deep in the ground. They are tuber-like shaped, or sheroidal or irregular and they are about 1 to 15 cm. long. The body is made by an internal substance called ""gleba"" in which you can distinguish the fertile zones (darker) which carry the ""aschi"", a peculiar kind of spore, and in which the spores (the vehicles of diffusion for this organisms) mature, and the sterile zones (lighter) which surround the fertile zones, originating in the most evolved species a characteristic venation system. The ""gleba"" is protected on the outside by a variable

Jeff, My name is Kurt Lindahl.  I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG team.  I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast.  Michael McGarry, from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead Development Engineer on the project. A key question in this effort is, ""Where is the best entry point into the Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems.  In other words, where can we site a LNG terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of facilities they require is minimal?  I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the optimization department in ETS.  He said that if we could get annual flow diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in about 2 weeks time.  Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the CPUC?  That's where I need your help.  This is a hot subject, because the race to site an LNG terminal is intense. Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can discuss.  We want to keep this effort very confidential, so please maintain secrecy. I will also want to talk to you about permitting and state approvals. Regards,

Lara:  I have rather hastily put this list together.  For that I apologize. Hope it is helpful.  The things on the list are ones that you've likely already considered.  Nevertheless, some of the issues we face in California include: 1. POWER PLANTS The utilities' subs are building power plants; competitors (like Enron) are also trying to develop plants to sell power into both wholesale and retail markets. The utilities control the interconnection of plants to the grid. The interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous, that the utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors. This would have an effect on prices at both the wholesale and retail level (i.e., how do we know we've gotten the best generation deal if the utility can favor its subs plants via interconnection?). 2. DISTRIBUTED GENERATION And the same goes for DG:  in California many are pointing to DG as a viable solution to the price spikes. If the utility loses sales because a customer has installed DG on her premises as a hedge against price spikes, the utility will have an incentive to thwart interconnection of the DG unit.  (Recall that in many places, recovery of distribution costs is derived from kwh sales; and if sales go down, so can recovery of the utilities' distribution-related costs). In addition, if someone attempts to install DG at the grid level (as opposed to on-site DG) and sell the DG power in wholesale and retail markets, the utility has the ability to frustrate the DG project via interconnection. This permits the utility to retain bundled service customers.  Utility control of DG Interconnection can also permit the utility to favor its DG subs. 3. INTERCONNECTION/VOLTAGE BUY-UP And the same goes for the retail level---remember how SDG&E used interconnection to thwart our deal with South West Marine in San Diego. (Obviously, we're not doing these deals any more, but the interconnection caused us ultimately to lose the commodity deal, too.) 4. TRADING PG&E and Sempra have developed significant trading units. Now that the utilities have been granted authority to buy outside the PX, the trading subs are getting more aggressive and vocal about the opportunity to sell the utility power via short and long term power contracts. Again, any sort of favoritism could do considerable harm to consumers and competition (through the shareholders of the utilities' parent would surely profit). 5. DISTRIBUTION In general, the utilities control over distribution is complete and it's a problem (see DG, above, for example). Shouldn't state and federal policy makers at least consider doing the equivalent of FERC Order 888 (i.e., open access) at the distribution level? Right now, distribution is a real black box. 6. RETAIL In California, the utility effectively controls customer sign-up, switching, information, and turn back.  The problems have been significant. 7. MARKET INSTITUTIONS Finally, a big mistake in California was to replace one monopoly--the utility--with another--the PX. Because the utility has been forced to buy from the PX, and because the market structure in California gives customers no incentive to switch, the utility continues to control the overwhelming majority of the load in California. This gives the utilities monopsony power.  With that power, they can influence PX prices. Solution:  1) Don't make the PX a monopoly. 2) Create a system that provides customers with the incentive to switch.
