We are in a loop.  We need a process to deal with this.  All ideas welcome. -------------------------- 
I'm looking for ISDA's between Enron MW and ENA and RMT.  I don't know where to look.  Can someone locate these for me? Thanks, 
Could I get a copy of the Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership termination letter? Thanks, 
Here's a revised letter: 
We can work with it either way. -------------------------- 
Dominion's lawyer left me a message that they are sticking with the termination.  I will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering. Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.  We can discuss options early next week.  I have beed in contact with him, and he is familiar with the issues. The contract is a bit complicated.  I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV. Kay -------------------------- 
comments?

FYI.  I'll bring you the ONSI confidentiality agreement. 
Hi Dan, One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments? FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA. I will follow up to get the details of the discussion. Kay 
This is an internal draft, which has not been sent to CRRA, as far as I know. Kay 
Here's a first ckm draft based on what we had before.  From a substantive standpoint I used fuel cell energy technology as a generic, and not specifically relating it to FCE.  I based this on a very brief discussion I had with Heather, so I hope I didn't misunderstand. I've incorporated the confidentiality agreement by reference, and included a brief statement that this transaction falls within its purview. Please let me know your comments.

My brother just called, and my dad has just been admitted to the hospital for a heart problem.  There is a good chance that they will operate tomorrow or the next day.  If they do, then I will need to go to Ft. Worth for a couple of days. I'll keep you posted. 
I would like to take Dec 26, 31 and Jan. 2 as vacation days. Thanks, 
I'm going to take today as a vacation day, since what I need to do today I can handle from home. I'll be in tomorrow. Thanks, 
I'm in the Enron Basics of Risk Management seminar Thurs (til 5) and Fri am. I would like to take next Wednesday as a day of vacation. Thanks, 
I know there's a lot of anxiety about severance, reflecting the possibility that the existing Enron severance plan might be changed. I noticed in the merger agreement that a ""floor"" was set on severance.  Have you heard anything about what Dynegy has for severance? I know there are exceptions, but I was just curious, as lots of folks are very nervous. From the merger agreement: 
At the very least, the cancellation charges are theirs. 
Being revised currently, but lays out the deal: 
I'll work on them over the weekend. 
Hi Lee, Can you confirm that the retention amount for the ""old"" turbines? I've got $705,200 per. Thanks, Kay 
It would help if you could take a quick look at these few changes. Kay

How are you guys doing?  Nothing new here, I'm just hanging out recuperating.  I was up all day yesterday and didn't feel too tired.  Of course the real test will be when I have to walk a lot!  My incision is still pretty tender, but I'm sure that's to be expected.  My waistline has gone down about 2 inches though since I've lose all that swelling from the infected gallbladder. You guys won't recognize me when I return (ha)! Ruthie is recovering from her surgery a whole lot faster than I am.  She's not yelping any more when she gets off the bed. That's about all of my news.  What's going on over there? 
Not that this is a big deal, but I heard a voice mail from Mark stating that Lance is the DASH guy while Mark is in DC.  Maybe that was deal specific. Maybe we can grab something quick and eat upstairs.  I am underwater.

Hi again, Delta Power will be making revisions to the LLC for tax purposes.  I've given them your email address to include you in the distribution. 
Here's the letter agreement I referenced in my other email. Kay 
Hi Rhett, I'm working on one of these turbine transfers via the sale of 80% of the equity of the LLC.  I'll forward the operative docs to you right away.  In any event, here's a change the counterparty wants to the tax language in the letter agreement. Kay 
Hi, attached is draft language: ""substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, provided that the LLC Agreement may differ from such form in such respects (which may or may not be substantial, but which shall not affect the economic rights of the parties thereto) as may be necessary or desirable to properly reflect [Pegasus as the sole owner] [the treatment] of the LLC for federal income tax 
Please see the two additions below. 
Lets at least get the Florida ones done.  Any idea why she didn't go? 
I thought you were supposed to have your toes in the sand in Florida. I'll have to check with Kathleen on the details of the documentation for the various development companies.  If there are a couple most active we can put those on the top of the list. Kay 
Well, you know how casual lenders are about commitment letters... 
David, Do you know if we are meeting on Monday?  I haven't heard the final word. 
Hi Wilson, It would be great if we could talk this week.  I'm under the gun right now, but will you be available on Friday for a chat? Thanks, Kay ""Wilson Montjoy"" <wmontjoy@brunini.com> on 04/03/2001 11:24:57 AM 
My conflicts check turned up no problems, so I'm looking forward to working with you. I have looked over the LOI you sent. Please let me know who you want to proceed from here. 
Carolyn, Please send to the counterparty (subject to further Enron review).  I suggest a conference call with Delta at 100 to discuss where we are. 
I had a momentary lapse.  Too many turbines, not enough time! 
I remember that the longer I played softball, the bigger the women were. When I was in my late 20's and early 30's, I played men's league, and I think they were smaller than the women! ""Lisa Clarke"" <lisa@casa-de-clarke.com> on 04/03/2001 09:02:24 AM 
Good Morning! Yes, that's the big girls. But, she's not as tall as the picture makes her look. The player standing right behind her is only 5 feet tall. Some of the other girls are only about my height. There's a reason why we encourage her to play softball and not volleyball. If genetics means anything, I think her build will be more along the softball player lines! It may also be the angle the picture was taken. I think Annie is probably getting close to 5 feet tall, but I wouldn't swear on it. Probably 4'10"" or so. Have a good morning! Love you! Lisa ---------- 
Ben called this am and said we can go ahead. 
How does Wednesday look for a conference call? 
I'm ok.  Theresa Zucha has generously offered to help me with my expense account, which I really wasn't comfortable asking Warren to do anyway. Thanks for asking. 
New and hopefully improved version, changing confidentiality and the statement in the term sheet on structure. 
You may have these for Tex Mex.  John expects to use something similiar on the coal plant, but obviously that is up to you. Kay

This will be yours when you get back - same counterparty as Tex Mex, I think.  I'll finish this and forward you some other docs. kau 
Kay, 1.) We are entering into a CA with BPUB, can we reference it in Article II, Paragraph 3?  It's term is ""two years from the date of this letter"", presumably  21 March 2003. 2.) Under the ""PRELIMINARY TERM SHEET""  where we define ""Structure"" do you think we need to elaborate on the phrase ""appropriate project  structure""? Maybe we should say ""appropriate project equity participation and finance structure"". Otherwise, I like the document.  I called John Davidson, outside counsel for BPUB, this morning and he's approved the CA.  I expect that we'll get a partially executed CA within the next day or so. JMoore Kay Mann 04/02/2001 01:11 PM 
Anything else for the term sheet?  Feel free to add it and return to me. 
As requested, here is the current draft of the Midway LOI.  The counter party has not seen this draft yet, so this is still preliminary. I'm reviewing the term sheet re toll. 
Ok. ""Campbell, Carolyn"" <CCampbell@KSLAW.com> on 04/02/2001 07:10:10 PM 
Kay: I just realized that I sent you the blackline of the ENA/PPL letter agreement without adding the covenant on the part of PPL to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain their financing as we discussed.  I will add this prior to circulating the letter agreement to the other side tomorrow. FYI - Greg Lang just called to check on timing.  I advised that Enron was reviewing the commitment letter internally, and we would not be ready to respond until Tuesday morning. Carolyn M.

Kay, I am back at the plate for another shot at your schedule.

Hi Karen, Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for Pastoria?  We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version. Thanks, 
Hi Kent, I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and selling some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the turbines are turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are buying new LM's to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta Power is financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on the attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response to the attached. I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy anyway. Thanks, Kay

I came in too late to know whether it was offered or asked for, but yes, it is a deliverable.  The Delta deal is being financed, so they are asking for a lot of docs, including a letter from GE counsel. To make it more fun, there are complications with the GE consent on the Pastoria deal.  It is not a happy time between GE and Enron, but I hope it will smooth over quickly. More to come. Kay PS.  Still no comments from NorthWestern. We need to talk about how scheduling problems Easter weekend if this thing drags on. Ben F Jacoby@ECT 03/31/2001 09:50 AM Sent by: Ben Jacoby@ECT 
Kay: Since NorthWestern and Delta are using Paul Hastings, I'm concerned about NorthWestern asking for an acknowledgement letter as we provided to Intergen. Have we offered to provide an acknowledgement letter to Delta on the LM6000s? Regards, Ben 
Comments from Enron Finance. 
Hi there, I suggest that we have an Enron only call at 230 central on Sunday, in advance of the  300 call with Delta.  I believe the call in number is 877 232 0064, pass code 25581#. Kay 
For your reading pleasure. 
I have taken what I believe this is the most recent form of the GE turbine contract, changed to reflect the difference in purchaser, and filled in some of the blanks.  I have compared it against the Delta redline that Rick sent me this afternoon, after having accepted Delta's proposed changes for the purpose of running the comparison.   The notes included are placeholders since I wasn't clear if these items will change with the equipment swap. GE is also reviewing Salmon Energy Agreeement version 2. redline Thanks, Kay

You might check to see if this looks like the one in the binder.  I believe it is one and the same. Kay 
Attached is a revised draft of the acknowledgement letter which Tejas would require from GE as a condition to closing.  The letter has been revised to incorporate the substance of the changes which Don and I discussed with Ben Jacoby this morning.  Additional changes to the letter may be needed after Coral has seen and reviewed the Facility Agreement. - 5wk8803_.DOC

We are trying to close with Delta, and they saw a March 20th draft.  Also, I had it  revised to take out E Next and substitute the llc.  So now I have two versions.  Just trying to get it clear.  I've spoken with Lee about revising the contract to pick up the new contract, leaving the ""old"" turbine in the master agreement, to be included in the LV Co Gen break out contract. Couldn't be simpler. Kay

Larry left me a voice mail.  Would you mind calling him and telling him that I am tied up on a conference call that is likely to last until 500, so I can't call him until after then. I would really appreciate it!!!!!!!! XXXXXOOOOOO CKM 
I can't open the form, but I'm good for $50.  Is this something Enron can match? 
I would guess ""yes"".  I don't know that I like the idea either. 
I'm on a conference call which I hope will end by then - a deal we are trying to close today.  YIKES!!!!

Have I written you back yet?  It is such a zoo, I can't remember.  I've started this email 3 times. I'm going to the Astros game on Thursday in the Diamond seats.  I'll watch for Ric.  Both Neil and I will be there.  I love those seats.  That's where I'm sitting on opening day, also.  I'm sure you will be at a game soon. Remember how nice it was this time last year for those first games?  It is no nice with the roof open. How many games do you have tickets to this year? They have James Coney Island outside today.  I ate most of two hot dogs.  I bet I'll be sleepy soon.  I brought them back up here, so my office will probably still smell like chili when  you come back. Guess I'd better get back to work.  Rest up and get well. Kay suzanneadams@att.net on 03/30/2001 08:21:13 AM 
Things must be busy since I didn't hear from anyone yesterday.  Ric is going to the Rockets game on Tuesday with vendors and the Astros Diamond Seats with vendors on Thursday.  I was wondering if you could come over and visit after work next Thursday.  We could have drinks and visit.  That way I wouldn't be all alone!!! Ruthie's surgery went well, but she isn't feeling very good.  She's throwing up from the pain meds I think.  We haven't given her any more, but you can see her cringing as she breathes.  Bless her heart, I know how she feels. Well, you won't be moving until I get back, so it'll be interesting to see what happens.  I wonder if you'll get a promotion.  I bet women problems won't even phase Ben, but maybe, we can always hope!  Usually you say female problems, and the men run the opposite direction. I just got finished paying bills!  Boy, do I have a lot of them! I'm anxious to be able to go to the Astros game.  We have tickets for this coming weekend but I won't be able to go.  I can't remember when our next regular season tickets are since I don't have my calendar in front of me. I'm going to venture out to get my nails done today (drive).  I feel pretty good, so it should be ok.  I'm sure I am going to be SO READY to come back to work. I'm so glad I have email so I can keep in touch every day so I won't miss you TOO much! Tell Neil I miss his calls too!  Walking around downtown sounds like fun.  It'll be like in New Orleans.  We just go from bar to bar, restaurant to restaurant. Did Carlos' wife ever have her baby?

AC arrived around 200am today, weighing in at 7 1/4 lbs, 19 inches.  All are fine, with the exception of Papa, who suffered a slightly bruised ego when he fainted around 205.  As Carlos mentioned in his voice mail ""the women were quite amused"".  The syncope episode was attributed to a hot delivery room. Right. Anyway, I don't intend to communicate with Carlos about the Delta deal.  He has his hands full. Talk to you later today, Kay 
Huh? 
FYI.  Please read. 
fyi 
Hi there, I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs, but here's the main one.  I'm giving it a close look this am, since I haven't been involved in this deal for a little while. Herman, this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks ago. Lisa and Catherine, I'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in the pack with the current ones.  I have a call in to Lee Johnson to discuss it with him, just to make sure he is on board. I know it can be done, we just have to figure out the paper trail. Chip, I haven't received the Hancock letter yet. Stephen, your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated. Talk to all soon, Kay PS.  Anna Claire Sole arrived at 200am today. 
Well, things are hopping around work!  Dan and I have barely had time to say hello, and you know how I am about getting my dose of Dan.  I've got several deals going great guns, so you know how that goes. I had lunch with Stuart and Kathleen today, and that was fun.  Neil and I have a date night tomorrow, so we are trying to decide what to do.  I suggested we just walk around the downtown hot spots, if the weather is nice. I've got diamond seat tickets for next Tuesday's opener.  I'm going to tell Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave me alone.  I figure if that doesn't do it, nothing will.  Neil gets to go with me, which is really nice.  It is a 4 o'clock game, which I think is a neat time.  Daylight savings time starts next week, so I guess the sun will be setting as the game ends.  I'm glad baseball season is back, although I did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game. Carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the hospital so she could be induced.  Texas Women's was too busy to take them. They finally called them in at 700 tonight to come in, so I guess they will have a late night. You bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen.  I keep hoping to have an hour to bring it by.  I figure it will be good  no matter when you get it. My transfer to Power Trading is back on.  I think some of the work I do is transferring with me, but I'm not sure.  In short, I don't know what the difference will be.  It isn't supposed to happen until May, so I'm not giving it too much thought.  Elizabeth gave me a brochure for another seminar - this one in Newport Beach at the Four Seasons.  I'm liking the sound of it! I miss you terribly, as does Neil. Take care and get well quickly.  It isn't the same without you!!!!! Kay suzanneadams@att.net on 03/29/2001 12:02:16 PM 
Anything going on that I should know about.  Just checking in.  I'm doing fine, feel great! 
FYI. 
What do you think of this?

Is this for the  turbines being sold to Delta as opposed to the new replacement equipment? Thanks, Kay Dale Rasmussen@ECT 03/27/2001 01:19 PM

Hi Carlos, Jake called and said he wants to sign up Delta tomorrow (Friday).  I had a conference call with John, Carolyn and Rick Vincens, and we are pushing forward.  If you read this, could you tell me about any critical issues. Also, has there been a risk memo started, and has Accounting signed off on the structure? I'll get up to speed on this during the evening, and will take your deal toy when the deal is done. 
I don't believe we need Keffer's input to process the LOI.  I can have their power guy look at the term sheet if we think we are done with it. 
You shouldn't have told Ben. 
No room at the inn for today and probably not tomorrow.  Carlos says he will be here tomorrow unless something happens tonight. 
AE, When you get a minute please send me your favorite option agreement so that I can get it Hermanized. Thanks, 
Good.  Does that mean I'll see you there? ""Keffer, John"" <JKeffer@KSLAW.com> on 03/29/2001 10:47:52 AM

Mitch/John, Here's the form of LOI I was thinking of using, in draft form.  I don't know how much information we are prepared to fill in on the term sheet.  If we don't have enough to fill in we can always skip the term sheet for now. Kay 
I'll nose around here. 
We need to cancel Michael's appt with Sharon for that Monday.  Also, why don't you try to find at least 2 people to go with you to the Astro's game on Tueday.  I'll come if I can. ckm ""Neil Mann"" <nmann@erac.com> on 03/29/2001 09:22:35 AM Please respond to <nmann@erac.com> 
I only have you out on April 5 and 6 on my calendar.  Is there another day? 
Yes and no. They were supposed to call at 5am to see if they should come in at 700 (space permitting).  If no space is available, they are to go in at noon.  I'm guessing they went in at 7, since I think he would have called to say they haven't gone in.  Just a guess, though.  He has his computer at home, so I think if he was sitting around he would drop us a note. Kay 
You are referring to the purchase and sale agreement, right?  I'm not asking him to do anything on the LOI. I haven't spoken to him in person.  I'll address it when we connect.  Are you available this afternoon to talk to him with me? Kay 
Here's a draft for your review.  We should talk about the generator before this is sent to MPC. 
I haven't read this, so I don't know if it is anywhere close to your deal, but here's a bootleg copy of the Frontera agreement, just to give you a sense of some type of starting point. Kay 
Well, Ben's POA is executed, it is just a matter of getting some of the poa's for the subs worked out.  Come see me whenever you want. 
I didn't know there was one. ""Thompson, Peter J."" <pthompson@akllp.com> on 03/28/2001 03:00:02 PM 
I got this from Carlos from a deal he and Carolyn have worked on.  Note that the language sounds familiar.  Someone must have sent this form to NorthWestern.  I suspect an Enron person. Kay 
I agree it is Matt, and  I believe he has reviewed this tax stuff (or at least other turbine K's) before.  His concern will be us getting some amount of advance notice before title transfer (ie, delivery).  Obviously, he might have some other comments as well.  I'm happy to send him the latest, or maybe he can access the site? Kay 
Fyi 
If someone can give me the name and address of Montana Power, I can finish the exclusivity agreement today. 
I'm not aware of an override agreement with ABB. 
Suitable for printing. 
Ben, I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity. Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we didn't do it with the turbine stuff) 
Remember the count down! 
Michael is off school April 13 and 16.  I have 3 deals which are supposed to close around then, so I'm not optimistic.  If possible, I will take at least one of those days. On the summer camp, if we use a camp by you, we will probably lose Charlotte for the summer.  Does that matter to you? 
Hi Wilson, Can you open this attachment? Kay 
Hi Karen, Sounds familiar. I'm sure you checked this, but in some of the GE contracts, the parent guarantee provision is under the purchaser's responsibilities section, near the beginning of the contract.  A strange place for it. Good luck,

Thanks for the reply.  I found it on her desk! Kay 
attachment contains overview 
I had a brief conversation with Herman Manis, and he tells me that there is a different interpretation of accounting rules relating to power plants. Strangely enough, the change is one which should (I hope I hope) make power development projects easier.  In the past, we ran into problems anytime we wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it.  Herman tells me that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance of the plants, and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant. This change in focus should make power development deals easier to structure. I would still like to set up an Intro to TurboPark meeting with Rose Engeldorf.  Rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the West this week, so it may be a bit before we can get it set up.  A meeting with Herman would also be helpful.  Maybe we can buy him lunch and quiz him on these new developments. 
These are both pending, but just so you know they exist, I'm sending this along.  Once these are signed I'll send you copies. Kay 
Are these ok with you? 
I'm thinking MK may not be email proficient.  Also note WordPerfect documents.  I bet her secretary had to come into the the office on Sunday.

Right. 
Pete, Please send John Schwartzenburg a copy of the Fountain Valley transformer contract. Thanks, 
My recollection is that the original ABB contract was assigned into TurboPark without revisions/restatement/consent, or a break out contract.  I think EECC had the typewriter on the original contract.   I quickly  looked in my TurboPark binders, but didn't immediately find the ABB contract. There was a breakout contract done for the CA Development deal, and Pete Thompson (with AK out of DC) would have generated that document.  It wasn't approved by the TurboPark team since it was entered into by the Enron LLC post TurboPark.  I wasn't involved in the Fountain Valley transformer contract, but my guess would be that Pete Thompson worked on it.  The footer you described sounds like an AK footer. Kay 
I'll leave that up to you.  We can make faces and pass notes if you come over, but I suppose that isn't essential to the transaction. ""Keffer, John"" <JKeffer@KSLAW.com> on 03/27/2001 08:41:12 AM

FYI.  I don't know what I think about this email.  I will say that I've heard good things about Clark, but haven't worked with him.  Also, there is a big difference between a transmission project and a power project, since tranmission assets are treated differently from an accounting standpoint. Obviously, I don't consider the question of who is handling this (internally or externally) to be resolved, pending further discussions. Kay 
Understand from John Moore that there is a new solid fuel power project being discussed for the Brownsville area, and that you will be involved.  I would really like to talk to you about this at your convenience.  As you may know from John, we have been very involved with the Tex Mex transmission line project that we have done with BPUB and that has just received board approval.  We have a very good relationship, I believe, with BPUB, the Port of Brownsville and their respective counsel from that transaction.  John also seems to believe the deals with BPUB and the Port will be structured along the same lines as the transmission project, and as the draftsmen for not only the docs with BPUB, but also the Port,  we are also obviously very familiar with these documents as well. Could we possibly talk about this project at your convenience?  We would really like to do a deal with you and your team and given our background on the first project, it would seem to make a lot of sense from your point of view as well.  I would be happy to drop by to discuss staffing, timing, etc. whenever it would work best for you. Many thanks - look forward to hearing from you. cgt Clark G.

I hope everything is going OK. With Kathleen's help and Jeff Hodge's review the CA went out on Wednesday via email to BPUB.  Mitch and I are reviewing the TEX/MEX agreements to determine an appropriate commercial structure with the intent of preserving as much of the ""legalese"" in the original agreements (i.e., the development agreement and the participation agreement) as possible.  Our major concern is to keep this off Balance Sheet. I'll call B &P to see if they have electronic versions.  Would you consider having Aaron Roffwarg of B & P work on this agreement, he was previously involved in the drafting of the agreements and he knows all of the players and their habits. JMoore Kay Mann 03/23/2001 11:39 AM 
I'm still out of town, but now I have email access.  Did your CA get taken care of? You mentioned that you feel like we can use Tex-Mex as a go-by.  Do you have electronic copies of the development agreement? Thanks, Kay

Purchase Price:  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbin= es=20 (subject to adjustment as described below). [Adjusted how?  Need specific= =20 reference. Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent= =20 with the structure?  Definitely sounds like a UCC deal,  for what that=01,s= =20 worth.] 2.  Closing Date of Purchase:  The Purchase will close on a date on or prio= r=20 to September 1, 2001, as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days= =01,=20 written notice to ENA,(provided that such notice may not be given less than= =20 30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement relating to the=20 Purchase).

The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0= =20 million down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement= =20 with ENA providing for the Purchase.

Sounds perfect.  Unfortunately, Bart works on West deals.  I'll talk to my boss (Jeff Hodge) and see what he says. John Moore 03/23/2001 12:43 PM

Hi John, I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.  Let me take a look at the agreements first, before we commit.  Did Bob Carter work on these agreements?  He might have copies, and he won't charge us for them.  At least I don't think he will. Thanks for your understanding and patience this week. Kay John Moore 03/23/2001 12:15 PM 
I hope everything is going OK. With Kathleen's help and Jeff Hodge's review the CA went out on Wednesday via email to BPUB.

Hi Dan, What's the latest with Suzanne?  Is she home yet?  Do you have her home number/address? Thanks, Kay 
We are contemplating selling the Blue Dog turbines to NorthWestern.  I've been out of town with a sick dad, so I'm not clear who has been in the loop and who hasn't.  However, since these are TurboPark turbines, I wanted to make sure you are aware of the deal.  It is the commercial teams desire to enter into an exclusivity arrangement as soon as possible.

First order of business.  Again, we can discuss this on Monday. I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a telephone call today.  I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.  I really hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction. Talk to you Monday. Kay

NorthWestern has agreed to our request to remove the Corp guarantee from the letter.  We will change the dash to reflect the change. 
I'm out of town, but can donate next week.

I had thought I would be the lawyer on the Mitsubishi consent, until I was removed two weeks ago in favor of Rose. Then I heard today from Ozzie that Rose was off and another ENA lawyer ( I don't know who) was heading up the effort with Mitsubishi. I didn't suggest you get involved, and as you can see I wasn't copied on any of the arrangements ( until you forwarded them to me ). I think this is by design, as Ozzie has asked that I  focus my time on finalizing arrangements with FPUA, FMPA and Turbo Park. Kay Mann@ENRON 03/15/2001 04:29 PM

Like I said before, I'll back you up on whatever decisions you make, for whatever that's worth. My folks  number (just in case you lost it) is 817 292 3367. Ciao, 
I heard a rumor that Carlos Sole has been tasked with the Mitsubishi consent.  I'm sure he will do a great job. 
Sorry I didn't come up with more concrete examples.  I'm really concerned about my dad, although I try to deny it. I still think that we should insulate ENA on the next deal. Kay

I like it.... 
Carlos and I are discussing options right now. Stephen Thome@ECT 03/19/2001 03:54 PM 
Jake received a call from Rick Vicens.  Apparently, Delta has agreed to our $68 mm in escrow at closing.  However, they have not agreed to the corp guarantee.  Can we structure our LLC to free us from any liability instead of having Delta's corp guarantee. Steve 
Every day? 
I'm working at home today, headed to Fort Worth tomorrow. I spoke to Carlos shortly after you were up there, and he mentioned you were looking for an org chart, and he recalled that I had sent him one. Kay John Schwartzenburg@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/19/2001 03:20 PM

Ben, I will try to be on at least part of the phone call on Thursday, technology permitting. 
Nothing is simple. Barton Clark@ECT 03/19/2001 03:16 PM 
I had thought I would be the lawyer on the Mitsubishi consent, until I was removed two weeks ago in favor of Rose. Then I heard today from Ozzie that Rose was off and another ENA lawyer ( I don't know who) was heading up the effort with Mitsubishi. I didn't suggest you get involved, and as you can see I wasn't copied on any of the arrangements ( until you forwarded them to me ). I think this is by design, as Ozzie has asked that I  focus my time on finalizing arrangements with FPUA, FMPA and Turbo Park. Kay Mann@ENRON 03/15/2001 04:29 PM 
I'm not planning to get involved since this is your deal.  Is that ok with you?

I sure hope it is this week.  It will either be this week, or a while.  How's that for keen analysis? It would seem to me that if we end up with breakout contracts signed by E Next, we should use the break out form, plus an override letter.  What do you think? 
Steve, Merchant Energy Ventures doesn't have auditable financials, but NorthWestern Corporation will give GE a corporate guaranty for MEV. Let me know if you run into difficulty verifying their financial status, as I'm sure we can get you something. In addition, Enron North America will have the responsibility to make the future payments to GE as these payment obligations exist as of the closing. Kay stephen.swift@ps.ge.com on 06/01/2001 08:53:13 AM 
Kay, Does Merchant Energy Ventures LLC have any auditable financials?  If not can Enron give some form of parent guarantee? Let me know if either is possible. Thanks, Steve Swift 
Hey Andrea, We are going to FW tomorrow, as my dad is having surgery to unclog one of his carotid arteries.  I'm kinda nervous about this one.  Everything else is going well.  Michael, Paige and Neil are all well and happy.  Paige has applied to the Astros for a summer job.  Seems like a long shot, but she really wants to do it.  Michael has a kid in his class named Colin Waters. His dad is the travel secretary for the Astros.  Unfortunately, I haven't met him yet. I can't wait to hear about your reunion.  I know it will be a blast.  Have fun! Kay ANDREA DOWLEN <nene77057@yahoo.com> on 03/19/2001 02:08:15 PM 
Kay - just checking in. I go to Orlando Thursday for 25th college reunion. Will try to get to the Astros game Friday. Been working at our Greenway Plaza office until the one at Woodway/610 is expanded/improved, etc. Word has is we may not start the Equiva account until May - supposed to be April 2, but we are all busy loading hundreds of traveler profiles.

Well, there's a little lesson in the value of being polite to EVERYONE. 
Here's a general description of the steps: Letter agreement signed Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC) $ deposited in escrow TurboPark notice given Closing date: TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption) LLC signs breakout contract Amended LLC, other closing docs executed Money released from escrow to Enron Enron pays off TurboPark This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.  I was unsure from your email if you see a problem with this process. Kay 
Sheila, If I were starting over again, there are a few things I would change.  First, the development fee as presented in this draft doesn't work.  Second, I would put all the put/call details in the llc agreement.  Third, I would make the put/call available anytime GE agreed to it.  The development fee has been discussed generally, but not fully vetted with Herman. 
Don't mean to lecture, especially via email.  Just trying to give some 
Reagan, FYI, it would bother me if Marvin called our outside counsel.  If you want me to call David,  just ask.  I'll be glad to do it, although I don't suggest bugging the other parties' counsel too much.  It uses up relationship capital, and it causes the counterparty to incur expenses they may not want to incur. Another FYI -  I don't much like Enron commercial folks calling Enron outside counsel unless we've discussed it in advance.  It violates Enron policy.  So once we have outside counsel on board, you still deal directly with me, and I'll manage the outside resources.  It really works better that way. Kay 
I cannot imagine a shirt larger than the one you received.  Yikes.  Sounds like Neil still has a chance for a new shirt. We'll have to allow extra time next Monday for a double de-brief. Kay

Reagan, I don't suggest it, especially since this is not an ""off the shelf"" deal. There are so many moving parts to this deal it could slow it down in the long run to get someone else involved for a few days. It is like getting a new commercial guy involved for 4 days. I'll defer to the great and powerful Oz. I should be available most of the day, so let's see how things go. Kay 
I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, which should help expedite matters. Kay 
I don't have any significant comments, but I picked up a couple of minor typos. From a structure standpoint, I think Enron doing the construction (and taking price risk) may be a structuring challenge, but I understand that's a bridge to cross later. Kay PS  I hope Mark isn't reading this today!  Great wedding. 
Federal jurisdiction and limit of liability verbage.  That's what comes to mind at this point. Could you email me the most current version (I think it was March 3)? Thanks, Kay 
Reagan, I haven't received an email from David Hunt yet.  I will make the changes you and I discussed last week, and perhaps we will get David's changes sometime today.

Kathleen, We need to set up an LLC for the Blue Dog turbines.  Chris had proposed some names at some point, then Ben had come up with something.  I now can't remember what it is.  Anyway, it needs to be on the list for next week. Thanks,

Don't be too grateful.  I think Jake wants you to weigh in no matter what. He obviously values your opinion. My personal opinion is you put the comments in front of Lee, and if he doesn't like them, the answer to Delta is no, we have no leverage to get your changes. Kay Dale Rasmussen@ECT 03/16/2001 05:39 PM

I have to confess that I didn't look at their comments to the turbine contract.  I will be glad to do it if you want.  Jake said that Bill Williams had some discussions with Delta, and he thought maybe some of their comments were no longer germane.  Bill has received their comments, but I don't know his reaction.

Ok, by now you think I've lost my mind. I can accept that. I believe this is the most current version which should form the basis of the Salmon LLC contract (formerly known as LV Co Gen facility agreement). Kay 
As mentioned in my other email... 
Tony, Rick, Here is a redline of the original turbine contract that I sent out.  The numbering has been corrected and some changes made to section 10.7. Let me know how your review is proceeding.  Our counsel has suggested that you may want to make a trip to Houston to go over the contracts if you have substantive comments.  We would like to have executable versions by close of business Friday. Steve 
Hi Pete, There's been a Plan B developed on the LV Co Gen project.  We are seriously exploring the possibility of selling the current LV Co Gen turbines to a third party, by selling the equity in a project co which acquires the turbines.  Sound familiar?  Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called Salmon somethingorother llc. I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent.  I believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the ""new"" Salmon contract.  I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with.  Carlos Sole  is the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats.  His number is 713 345 8191. I will be out of the office next week, but will periodically check my voice mail if  you have any questions. Thanks,

I took her in a while back for the cough, plus she goes in every 6 months for kennel cough and hearworm test.  They haven't said much and I haven't asked. Afraid to, I guess.  I got Kaley when I was with my former boyfriend, and she's been through it all with Paige and me. 
Sounds like a good match with Ruthie and Murphy. My old dog, Kaley, is really sounding bad.  She has a cough that just won't quit, which has gotten worse over the last couple of years.  I think it is her heart.  She's 11 years old, and moves slowly. Rosco owns the familiy now.  He is so quiet, but friendly.  Just likes to hang around close to everyone.

We have had no contact with the ENA/Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don't want to bust any structuring goals. Our project manager (Scott Laidlaw) and engineer (Harry Okabayashi) want to issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to support the ENA work. I now understand that someone at ENA/Enron Mexico/Enron Wholesale has signed an EPC  contract with ABB for this project. I am not in the office today, so please include Renee Alfaro on your response. JWVS Harry Okabayashi 03/16/2001 07:43 AM 
Please clarify if our contractors including engineering services on the Texas-Mexico HVDC project are required to be ""off-balance"" sheet. Best Regards, Harry Okabayashi 
Good afternoon, I'm forwarding a revised development agreement term sheet, showing revisions from your original version. We look forward to seeing you soon. Thanks, Kay

Hi Greg, I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option payment credited to the purchase price of the land.

Carlos' wife is due the 23rd, so I may need to cover for  him.  We'll see.  I do hope to take Michael and Rosco to Palacios where we can hang out, fish, play in the sand, etc.  In other words, no big plans, which I'm happy about.

Jerry Fox called to tell me that a decision has been made to by Peoples to withdraw the Petitions for Approval of the PGL and North Shore Master Sales Agreements. Jerry says this has been discussed with Enron. According to Jerry, the intent is to proceed with some of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement under exceptions to the affilliated interest approval requirements. (As you may recall, we discussed the possibility that some PGL/North Shore-enovate transactions may be expempt from the approval requirement before the Peitition was filed. ) At this early stage of the approval filing, the ICC Staff has not submitted testimony explaining its opposition to approval. From the Staff's data requests, however, it appears that they are not convinced that there is sufficient customer (i.e., public) benefit from establishing a contract between a utility and an affiliated entity to perform the transactions contemplated by the Master Sales Agreement when Peoples/North Shore acknowledge in the Petition that there are other contracts in place with non-affiliates to perfrom the same type of transactions. The Petition takes the position that the contract with enovate is beneficial in the same respect that each non-affiliate contract has benefit. ICC Staff (apparently) feels that the incremental benefit of one more contract is not enough to offset perceived risks associated with blanket approval of affilliate transactions under the Agreement. It may be possible persuade staff to change its position if we can show that the agreement with enovate will have a more significant effec on PGL/Noth Shore that one of the non-affiliate agreements. In other words, evidence of something unique or special about what enovate brings to the table is what could turn this around (if you are interested in doing so.) .

Dear Kay, Confirming our discussion, The Texas Lawyer has asked King & Spalding to organize a Roundtable Discussion of lawyers and business people to discuss how the two professions relate to each other in the context of complex business transactions. The Roundtable would take place privately in a conference room in our offices with a court reporter recording the discussion, which would then be published in an upcoming issue of the newspaper. Participants will have the opportunity to edit their remarks before they are published. John Cogan will be co-chairman of the proceedings with our partner, Chris LaFollette.  I unfortunately cannot attend as I will be out of town. The Discussion will take place on Thursday, March 15, from 2 to 3:30. We will hold a planning session over lunch in one of our conference rooms from 12:30 to 2. No other preparation would be required. You would be a terrific representative from Enron to join us and provide Enron's perspective. Please confirm your attendance as soon as you get the internal approvals by calling John Cogan at 713.276.7371 or by e-mail at jcogan@kslaw.com.

Hi John, I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel? One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway. Can you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations. Thanks, Kay

Hi there, Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets? I want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff. Thanks, Kay 
John, I would hestitate to give up the option to TurboPark this project, unless the commercial team commits that there is no way Enron will ever want to progress with the site beyond permitting.  As you know, there is no going back once we give up that optionality. Good catch, Renee. Kay John Schwartzenburg@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/13/2001 08:04 AM 
Project - Broward County, FL Right, Renee. We don't want to do sonething that might inadvertently bust any eventual off-balance sheet treatment that might apply. Hey, Ann. FYI, our usual form of PSA and Tasking Letter didn't fit these off balance structures on Mr. Clark's Ft. Pierce job. There was something of a controversy as a result and they had to be re-worked. We don't want to go there again. Kay, Ann, and Steve, do you know if  this project is to be Turbo-Parked and if so is the work  that you need the PSA and TL hard cost or soft cost? If it's to be Turbo Parked, let's work from the  forms Bart developed for Ft. Pierce. Renee, please copy Ann on each draft you turn out, including before you launch to the other side. I am out of the office this week,but checking e-mail and voice mail about once a day.  Please leat a voice mail for me at 713-646-6309 if you need me. Thanks. JWVS Renee Alfaro 03/12/2001 12:47 PM 
Broward County, FL John, I have received the following request for a PSA and Tasking Letter between ENA and EDSA from Steve Rose.  I want to make sure that the Deerfield Project, part of the Florida Greenfield Projects, is not being done through Off-Balance Sheet Financing, as this would preclude us from using the PSA form of contract.  To this end, I am copying Ann Elizabeth White, the ENA attorney on the Florida Greenfield Projects. Once it is determined whether a PSA and Tasking Letter is acceptable for the work, I will proceed accordingly. If the Florida Greenfields are being financed through Turbo Park, I believe Bart Clark has a Turbo Park form for the landscape artitecture firm being used on the Ft. Pierce Project and I could try getting a copy of that from him. Thanks Renee Alfaro Phone: 713-646-7281 Fax: 713-646-6158 Email: ralfaro@enron.com 
Broward County, FL Renee, I let you a voice mail message about this on Friday.  We have up until now been using the landscape architecture firm of Curtis-Rogers, working under a subcontract with Parsons Brinckerhoff, on the Deerfield Beach and South Dade sites.  Steve Krimsky has decided that he wants to use EDSA (another landscape architecture firm we've used on Pompano Beach) to complete the landscaping design work on Deerfield Beach, and to have them work directly for ENA rather than as a sub to PB.  I've already discussed this at length with Doug Smith, one of the principals at EDSA, and have e-mailed him a large quantity of design information and got EDSA kicked off to do the work.  Doug is supposed to send me a summary of EDSA's NTE costs for the tasks I identified to him, which I will forward to you as soon as I get it. EDSA is now working on the Deerfield Beach landscaping on the basis of my conversation and e-mail, and their preliminary deliverables are due Friday March 16 (i.e., the end of this week).  We need to get a PSA and TL set up between ENA and EDSA to formalize this arrangement.  I would like you to draft these two documents ASAP so that we can get the proper contract documents in place as quickly as possible. I will forward to you via separate e-mails the various documentation you will need to help put this together. I'm working at home today (typical ENA vacation day!), so you can reach me on my cell or at home if you want to talk about this. My numbers are: Cell:  713-854-4971 Home:  281-655-0185 Thanks in advance for your help with this task. Regards, Steve 
Hi Jeff, I don't know if you are picking up email, but just in case,  here's a description of the Roundtable. Kay 
Dear Kay, Confirming our discussion, The Texas Lawyer has asked King & Spalding to organize a Roundtable Discussion of lawyers and business people to discuss how the two professions relate to each other in the context of complex business transactions. The Roundtable would take place privately in a conference room in our offices with a court reporter recording the discussion, which would then be published in an upcoming issue of the newspaper. Participants will have the opportunity to edit their remarks before they are published. John Cogan will be co-chairman of the proceedings with our partner, Chris LaFollette.  I unfortunately cannot attend as I will be out of town. The Discussion will take place on Thursday, March 15, from 2 to 3:30. We will hold a planning session over lunch in one of our conference rooms from 12:30 to 2. No other preparation would be required. You would be a terrific representative from Enron to join us and provide Enron's perspective. Please confirm your attendance as soon as you get the internal approvals by calling John Cogan at 713.276.7371 or by e-mail at jcogan@kslaw.com.

Project - Broward County, FL 
Hey guys, PSA's are a hot topic, and I have a call into Lisa Bills to discuss it.  Lisa has been out of town for a few days, as has the GF TurboPark lawyer, Rose Engeldorf.  Rose is being seconded to ENA for TurboPark issues, and will be back in the office tomorrow.  We should sit down with Rose and puzzle through the issue. As for the ""standard"" EECC form PSA, it is a real bear.  Carlos has recently worked on a TurboPark/97-10 compliant form, and is waiting for Global Finance blessing.  He was going to talk to Bart about his experience, which could also add some extra insight. When you guys have some time it is probably worth taking a half hour to discuss it. Kay

yes, thanks. 
Good afternoon, I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review. There are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal. Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.  Therefore, we have sent this out without the usual internal review. We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly. Talk to you soon, Kay 
Bill Williams asked me to forward the attached execution form of the LM-6000 purchase contract. The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  I understand that we received it from GE, and that it is available only in pdf format. Thanks. 
Hi Marguerite, I'm on a telephone conference which is not likely to end before I have to rush out to take my son to an appointment.  Obviously, I have access to email.  Is there something I can answer for you by email? Thanks, Kay 
I kinda like Coyote LLC and Black Hills LLC (no spruce). 
Hi Ed, I can't find (or recall) that I received the subsequent email referenced in this email.  Can you direct me to the right place?  I looked under Administrator and Legal Net X, and all my emails from 3/8. Thanks, Kay 
I'm calling in (conference call) for this one.

Please check the cancellation policy for next week's seminar.  I may not be going. Thanks,

Hi.  I'm interested in joining.  What do I need to do to join? Thanks, 
I am selling my Bayou II kayak by Dagger.  It is a two person, enclosed style, kayak perfect for enjoyable kayaking with a special friend or family member.  Especially good for fishing because one person can paddle and 
Jake mentioned Delta but not Panda.  I'm with you - go Delta.  Who wants to mess with the broker issue? Ciao, Kay 
Ann Elizabeth, Can you handle this?  This is another Florida lobby deal. Kay 
Please don't.  I enjoy the laughter!  I was just jealous. 
Turbine Team, For future reference we should add in the put/call language (similiar to the language in 6.2 (c) of the Intergen deal) which allows Enron to put the equity to the buyer at any time GE consents.  We should soften the approval rights of the purchaser. Thanks, Kay 
The outside lawyer for Northwestern, Marguerite Kahn, would like to speak with you concerning the structure of the LLC, specifically including the promissory notes.  Guess I didn't explain it all that well. I asked her just to call you directly, and gave her your number. Thanks, 
This was the emergency. 
We have an agreement which resides in TurboPark.  Kathy Clark did the contract.

Hi John, I asked to have ONE guaranty prepared and ONE escrow agreement for Carlos and I to review the forms.  Now I've got two sets of docs sent by two K & S attorneys. Additionally, we are drafting against ourselves.  The letter agreement and the LLC have been given to the counterparty.  Seems to make more sense to wait for comments. HELP!!! Kay ""Reuter, Marisa"" <MReuter@KSLAW.com> on 03/09/2001 12:16:45 PM 
Hi Marisa, Please send the forms to Carlos also since for 2, 3, and 4 we will use the same forms. Obviously, we want the economy of doing this once for both transactions.  Also, please bill the time for these forms to Carlos' deal, since Blue Dog is paying for some of the development of the letter agreement and the llc forms. It sure sounds like we won't be tendering a facility agreement, but until the structure is agreed I would keep the letters in as place holders. Once the LLC is formed you will get the complete corporate books which will have the certificates. Thanks, Kay ""Reuter, Marisa"" <MReuter@KSLAW.com> on 03/09/2001 09:09:07 AM 
Attached is a clean and red lined version of the loi.  I'm expecting a call from David Hunt,  so I haven't dealt with the limit of liability stuff yet. The Beck comments are good comments which we need to discuss internally, but since we haven't, I'm happy to take the position that the comments seem to fit better in the drafting of the definitive ageements. Kay 
Do not take this too seriously until we talk tomorrow. Look forward to meeting you, Kay PS.  Hope it isn't too inconvenient for you to come.  Sheila really wanted you there. 
I would want to make sure that the structure of the deal goes through Herman.  There may be a tweak or a change which can have an impact on what gets booked on mark to market basis, etc.  He may have absolutely nothing to add, but I wouldn't take the chance. 
Don't forget that Herman reads everything, and to ask Fred if this deal will 
I think you'll find there isn't that much to a site sale.  Witness Plano/Pontiac as compared to the Peakers. 
I need staples and the stiff green folders.  I forget what these are called. Thanks, 
I had coconut cream  pie for lunch (also tuna).  I feel so guilty.  Light dinner for me.  And maybe a vodka (NO WINE). If I can get time to call Nathaniel, I will.  I'm in a conference call now. I feel guilty about being gone Sat. night if Paige is home for SB.  It does sound like a good weekend weatherwise.  I can check with her to see her preference. 
I just like to make Margie work. So do you think they'll fire Dierker?  I guess you heard Lima is heading to the bullpen. ""Reuter, Marisa"" <MReuter@KSLAW.com> on 05/31/2001 11:42:13 AM

Cheryl; moving day upon us once again I'm happy  to let everyone know that Cheryl Costa has joined our group as a regular member. This is very timely for us, and she will be focusing on finishing off the documentation for the Electro Bolt project as a priority matter. We have had to re-juggle the seating plan a little to accomodate this and other changes, and the moves will occur this weekend.  Cheryl will be moving into the office presently occupied by Bob Sevitz, who will be moving into the space presently occupied by Mike Lewis.  Kristi Dobbs will be moving into the space just outside of John Rigby's office presently occupied by boxes. The Carlos Sole Memorial Office presently occupied by his memory is reserved for the new attorney who will fill in for Carlos (fill in only, of course, there can be no substitute). I will be scheduling a meeting Friday, if not over lunch then in the early afternoon to discuss a few minor developments with you guys and to get some thoughts from you on the TurboPark and other off balance sheet models.

purchase option 
Here tis 
purchase option I am working on a deal to move TurboPark equipment into Enron owned LLC's, with a simultaneous sale of  80% of the equity to a third party.  This deal is supposed to close by Jan 15, so I'm getting a crash course on TurboPark and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase.  I thought I would share what I'm learning, if nothing else as a form of therapy. Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to take something out of TurboPark.  Five to fifteen business days' notice is required. There will be other documents involved as well: Bill of Sale Assignment and Assumption Agreement UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment) I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.  More to come on this one. As I learn more about the process I will keep you advised. Kay 
I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please prepare a draft of the two exhibits? Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the participation agreement and the development and construction management agreement. I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th. Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a ""release letter"" for the banks and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet. Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue. I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement. Thanks, Kay

This is the turbine contract to print and put on your desk. Kay 
Here's more for you to enjoy.  We need to make this into an XYZ form to match up with the letter agreement. Thanks, Kay 
Tony, Rick Our counsel has provided these drafts of the project documents.  Please review.  We also anticipate sending out the turbine contracts later today. Please be advised of our timeline.  Since we need to fund escrow by Wednesday 21 March, it is imperative that we are able to sign these documents on Friday 16 March.  It is our assumption there will be some lag between the obligation to fund escrow and the actual transfer of funds. Your comments to these documents are expected by Friday 9 March. I also want to mention that Enron initiated the additional purchase of Power System Stabilizers, which cost $31,675 per turbine.  PSS are required in the WSCC, but you will have to  determine whether or not your particular project would be required to install these in New England.  If you desire this optional equipment, please reflect that cost in your final bid. Steve

Hi Jeff, I need more in-depth information than what I could get from King & Spalding, so I asked around for a Mississippi firm.  Sheila suggested this firm, and Stuart said he thought they were an ok group.  As you can guess, it is a short list in Mississippi to chose from.  Please let me know what you think. Kay

Hi Gregg, I spoke to John N, and I think I understand what's up.  I'm in a conference call, but will holler later. 
Well, that's one reason why I don't think there's a lot of risk to it.  I know in previous deals the GE frame guys have agreed that we could give three redacted copies to suitors, and the real one to THE ONE.  I think a casual conversation will work.  The guarantees are nothing special, although the LD ramp rates sometimes matter.  Lastly is delivery, but again, I don't think it will be a big issue. Maybe if Jake knows that he probably won't have to tell Lee who the suitors are, that might help. Kay Dale Rasmussen@ECT 03/07/2001 12:40 PM 
Thanks for the update.  I suggested to Jake that he do that (but perhaps too obliquely) yesterday.  I will ask directly that he make it so. What is your sense as to the things that need to be redacted?  The breakout contract is structured in terms of what remains to be paid (rather than what the overall purchase price was).  I had understood that this was the subject matter that GE is most sensitive to. Kay Mann@ENRON 03/07/2001 10:45 AM 
Neither have us have spoken to GE.  I think Sheila spoke to Lee, but I don't know the substance of the conversation.  We asked his permission  on the Intergen deal, I believe.  I told Jake last night that there are arguments which can be made on both sides as to whether GE needed too consent to having the contract distributed to a potential partner.  He said he wanted to talk to you about it. My suggestion would be that someone on the commercial side discuss the general status, and ask if it is ok to send out a redacted contract.  That is the most conservative approach. Kay Dale Rasmussen@ECT 03/07/2001 12:33 PM 
Carlos:  Jake is hoping to get a copy of the turbine contract out to Delta this afternoon. Do you know whether anyone has approached GE for consent to disclose the contracts to potential purchasers? It sounded yesterday as though the form of contract may be changing, anyway. Either way, GE's consent is probably required.  Do you agree? Would you or Kay mind coordinating with Jake how and when the document can go out? 
Well, that's one reason why I don't think there's a lot of risk to it.  I know in previous deals the GE frame guys have agreed that we could give three redacted copies to suitors, and the real one to THE ONE.  I think a casual conversation will work.  The guarantees are nothing special, although the LD ramp rates sometimes matter.  Lastly is delivery, but again, I don't think it will be a big issue. Maybe if Jake knows that he probably won't have to tell Lee who the suitors are, that might help. Kay Dale Rasmussen@ECT 03/07/2001 12:40 PM 
Thanks for the update.  I suggested to Jake that he do that (but perhaps too obliquely) yesterday.  I will ask directly that he make it so. What is your sense as to the things that need to be redacted?  The breakout contract is structured in terms of what remains to be paid (rather than what the overall purchase price was).  I had understood that this was the subject matter that GE is most sensitive to. Kay Mann@ENRON 03/07/2001 10:45 AM

Lv Co Gen deal. 
Tony, Rick Our counsel has provided these drafts of the project documents.  Please review.  We also anticipate sending out the turbine contracts later today. Please be advised of our timeline.  Since we need to fund escrow by Wednesday 21 March, it is imperative that we are able to sign these documents on Friday 16 March.  It is our assumption there will be some lag between the obligation to fund escrow and the actual transfer of funds. Your comments to these documents are expected by Friday 9 March. I also want to mention that Enron initiated the additional purchase of Power System Stabilizers, which cost $31,675 per turbine.  PSS are required in the WSCC, but you will have to  determine whether or not your particular project would be required to install these in New England.  If you desire this optional equipment, please reflect that cost in your final bid. Steve 
Since I'm ""off"" today and Friday, and scheduled to be in Fla on Monday, AND without you, I'm not in much better shape.  You know I've kept all my files on email.  I was hoping there would be a way to move them to a Word file of something.  Otherwise, I guess I'm going to have to ask you to start printing - highly inefficient.  I can't do it here, though. Kay 
If there are any other resolutions, etc that they want, I would let them prepare them. Thanks a bunch, 
I think what I will do is send out an email today to have people call you directly and reserve a room.  We can then see how many short we are, and deal with the deposit.  I will tell them to inform you that they are with the Enron group.  Names of the individuals should be as follows; Kay Mann (I'll call with my card soon - I want the Premier) Heather Kroll Barbara Gray Peggy Banczak Lisa Bills Rose Engeldorf Nora Roberts Anne Koehler Lisa Mellencamp Christi Nicolay Gail Brownfeld Maybe this will help identify those who are REALLY in.

Hi there, I think a good next step while the counterparties are reviewing the docs is the creation of a closing checklist, since we have a good starting point with the Intergen closing list.  We can get organized on putting together a package of the next traunche of docs, such as the parent guaranty, escrow agreement, etc. Thanks, Kay PS.  You might want to check the docs I sent out to Jake to make sure I didn't put a Panda in a Delta doc.  I checked, but I need to be double

Electricity Deregulation is coming to Texas! What a great way to start off the New Year ? to be able to choose your electricity provider, which could mean potential savings for you and your family on your electric bill.  As you know, Enron has been a leader in lobbying for deregulation and a consumer's right to choose energy providers. For the first time in our state's history, 5 percent of Texas households will have this golden opportunity.  The NewPower Company (NewPower), which is approximately 45 percent owned by Enron, was recently formed to provide energy and energy-related services to residential customers in deregulating energy markets across America, including Texas.  For a limited time, Houston-based employees will be eligible to participate in NewPower's pilot program offering their deregulated electric service. Be Among the First to Participate: Enrollment with NewPower begins March 12.  Also, watch for a special Enron Employees Exclusive offer on your desk March 12.

Sorry to hear about Bobby's wreck.  I hope he feels ok tomorrow.  Neil's number at work is 713 596 8716, and  his email is nmann@erac.com.  I know you probably checked this, but are you sure you don't have car rental insurance under your auto policy?  Always good to check. Paige got a kick out of seeing Bobby.  I'm sure he enjoyed the fine cuisine. I feel the same about going up next week.  There will probably be a more appropriate time later. Paige is coming home for SB next week.  I suspect she'll come Friday or Saturday, but don't know for sure.  We are probably going to the Matagorda livestock show and auction this weekend, and maybe the rodeo.  It must be good - like the Belton rodeo. Hi and hugs to all! Love, 
I made a couple of minor revisions.  Jake has given us until when he gets in tomorrow. I changed Turbine Agreement to Turbine Contract (one place in the LOI), and added responsibility for filing fees in the llc agreement.  Perhaps it it redundant. I'm not sure I'm on top of the LLC agreement.  Maybe we can discuss in the

Carolyn, Please use NewCo instead of Spawn.  Also, please give them only one business day to review the final facility agreement.  Also, we need the duplicate forms for Sunlaw Energy Corporation. Will we be getting the drafts tonight? Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks, 
I don't know who started the initialling kick, and I don't know if I care if it continues.  I don't know if Lee cares.  It is probably an EECC artifact. If GE doesn't care, then I don't care.  ( I hear strains of a show tune ""I don't care, I don't care""). I think I've lost my mind. Kay Dale Rasmussen@ECT 03/06/2001 06:18 PM 
This is step 2 in an ongoing mystery. When I got the files from Peter there were no initial lines for the contract.  I was surprised, but presumed that this was no longer a requirement. Bill Williams has said he is prepared to initial whatever we put in front of him.  If we do the new form, we would have to redo the pages anyway (I presume).  If we take that course and I get the electronic version up here, I will ask Bill to sign on. Engage, Mr. Data. Kay Mann@ENRON 03/06/2001 04:05 PM 
Dale, Has GE initialled all the pages of the break out contract?  If so, it would be very helpful if you could ship me the originals.  That way, we only have to change the names, which will make it easier for Lee when we have to ask him to sign.  Also, has someone from the Enron side initialled all the pages?  That helps, too! Kay

Hi Sheila, I don't recall seeing a bill from Bracewell on the VECPCO deal.  Did you ever see one come in? Thanks, 
Good.  I hadn't heard back from them. 
Hi Carolyn, In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other thoughts: Letter agreement: I would bracket [Spawn], since we don't have it formed yet and we probably haven't checked on availability. 2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2 (a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology. 3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement. 5 (d)  change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"". 7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific performance? 9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing of the letter agreement.  Should say by closing such will have been obtained.  I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep unless you are comfortable.  I want the HSR risk to be with them, so I don't want to contradict it with the rep. I'll review the LLC agreement next. Kay

Leatha, I have a couple of questions.  Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in addition to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?  Both time frames are mentioned in your explanation. Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?  Does the cost include the tax trade on the Lexus?

Hi Leatha, Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it, however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous. They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous. When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to ""work on it"".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way. I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my Lexus. Thanks, Kay 
Carolyn, I believe the commercial operations terminology is appropriate, not takeover.  Please verify with the LV CoGen documents which I forwarded just a few moments ago. The changes I made to the definitions in the prototype letter were a result of the fact that the Blue Dog contract with GE uses slightly different terminology than the LM 6000 contracts.  We need to revert to the appropriate underlying contract. Thanks, Kay

I would suggest the week of the 19th through the 23rd. Wednesday and Thursday evenings work well for business dinners/socials. I have always enjoyed Americas, Churascos, or Cafe Annie for business gatherings.  I think that we should invite the Coral folks just to keep the night interesting (we can also talk with them about other transaction opportunities - they may be in the market for additional projects). Have any steps been taken to plan this event?  I can call John Jones at Intergen to run the concept and dates past him.  Let me know.  I am in the office until 2 pm on Wednesday and then on vacation on Thursday and Friday. Fred Enron North America Corp.

fyi.  Comment? 
Hi Leatha, Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it, however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous. They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous. When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to ""work on it"".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way. I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my Lexus. Thanks, Kay 
This is who Sheila suggested. The deal I'm working on is an asset management/control area services transaction.  It will be an odd one, so I'm not expecting someone to have specific expertise.  I need help on the general contracting under Miss law stuff, especially since there are some quirks involved.  Your input would be appreciated. Thanks, Kay

Re;  enovate/Peoples 
I called Jerry Fox to check on the status of the ICC Staff's testimony which was to be filed Feb. 28. Jerry reports that Staff requested an extension until March 29 to file their testimony. Staff has indicated that it intends to conduct further discovery, i.e. send more data requests. Jerry also says that Staff has inofrmed Peoples informally that it is (apparently strongly) opposed to approval of the filing. Jerry says that Peoples is considering whether to withdraw its Petition for approval. As I understand it, this depends on whether there is a way to pursue transactions with enovate without a need for approval (presumably under the ""market price"" exception to the approval requirement.) I suggested that it may be preferable to wait until Staff files its testimony (explianing its position) before making a decision about withdrawal. Jerry says Peoples' concern is the additional disocvery which may be conducted. As I understand it, the case is being discussed internally at Peoples. I don't know whether Peoples has discussed this with you (Gregg) or anyone at enovate. ========== The preceding e-mail message (including any attachments) contains information that may be confidential, be protected by the attorney-client or other applicable privileges, or constitute non-public information.

Here are my responses: 1. Development fee is a commercial question.  This will need to be vetted with Herman if we go with it.  Personally, I'd skip it and push to sign next week. 2.  I have a call in to Dale. 3.  No LLC.  Kathleen will handle.  The closer the creation is to the signing of the letter, the better, taking into account the time required to get the docs back and set up.  Someone needs to name it.  We should also look at a minimal list of officers. 4.  I don't have the attachment in front of me, so I will have to look it up.  I'll get back to you.  The concept is that ENA is only responsible for changes in the amounts owed to GE as of the closing date.  I thought the language was awkward, and tried to make it more clear, but obviously failed! As soon as I get the break out contract from Dale we can check on the definitional questions. It SHOULD be the same as in the CA breakout contract with GE, but I won't make that assumption.  Drop dead date on put/call Dec. 2002. 5. This needs to be discussed with Ben. 6.  This should be set up as a  new matter, since these aren't the Blue Dog turbines. You can send the bill to Sheila with a copy to me. I'll open the doc and take a look at it asap. Kay 
They haven't signed the other ones.  We moved the equipment straight out of TurboPark and into the llc, then on the same day sold down the equity of the llc. Please call to discuss at your convenience. Thanks, Kay Dale Rasmussen@ECT 03/05/2001 09:55 PM 
When you got the other breakout contracts signed by Wilmington Trust, to whom did you send them? I need to get the LV contract fully signed up now. Please let me know. I'm sorry I missed seeing you last week.

OK. This guy's a lawyer by training, but we're hiring him as a lobbyist. Roger was previously looking into this, and proposed our standard form agreement. Steve and I were wondering if we could work off of Tripp Scott's proposed form, considering that he will not be representing us as our counsel. Please let me know. Thanks, Ben Kay Mann@ENRON 03/04/2001 02:27 PM 
Ben, What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check to see what the drill is on this side of the street. Kay

CKM, I spoke to Althea Gordon in the Recruiting Dept today regarding the poor treatment Paige received in the recruiting process.  Here is her response. First of all, Paige should have received a rejection letter and a hold letter.  The rejection letter was from her submittal to the analyst process on her own.  The hold letter supposedly says that, based on referrals, she is on a waiting list and will be contacted for interviews provided there is any space left in the summer analyst class.  Basically they have offers out to what they call ""first-tier"" schools and are waiting for responses.  If they

Greg, I've read the opinion and agree with your summary of it.  However, it doesn't answer the question for me as to whether a Mississippi court would uphold such a clause, or how other contracting parties have dealt with the issue. Due to the importance of the issue I will consult with a Mississippi firm to get a handle on the question. Thanks for your help, Kay ""Evans, Greg"" <GEvans@KSLAW.com> on 03/02/2001 04:57:22 PM 
As an update to my earlier e-mail, I located both the Miss. AG's Opinion letter construing Section 100 and the initial request from a State entity that prompted the Opinion. Assuming a State entity is a party to a contract, the AG's Opinion does not opine that Section 100 prohibits contractual clauses that exclude consequential damages.  Instead, the AG's office could not find any statutory authority that allows a public officer to contractually limit a private vendor's liability to the State entity.  Although the AG did not state that such clauses are prohibited, the AG held that it could not affirmatively sanction such clauses in the absence of statutory authority.

Thank you for your helpful comments.  Good points. On the timing issue, we still have the time sensitivity, but I hate to give it a precise day.  Maybe the way to address that is within 10 BD's, as mutually agreed. I don't have the doc in front of me (I'm in Florida), but I thought it said ENA was taking responsibility for increases in the Purchase Amount as it exists the date of closing.  I'll check. I agree with deleting CO definition.  It doesn't add anything. Again, thanks. Kay ""Campbell, Carolyn"" <CCampbell@KSLAW.com> on 03/01/2001 02:07:06 PM

Stuart, If you need a copy of the executed Westinghouse letter, you can find the original on my desk, I believe on the left hand corner (looking out).  The letter we are waiting for is merely an acknowledgement that LJM doesn't need to sign.  I think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders, but I requested it anyway. 
Anyone know any good lawyers in Mississippi, or any lawyers knowledgeable about Mississippi law?  Power background would be nice, but I know that may be too much to ask. Thanks, 
Hi there, Please look this over, spell check, print and fax two copies to me, as we will be signing this doc this afternoon. Ciao, Kay 
It should be signed and on its way. I've heard that they are trying to schedule a meeting for Monday, so I'm trying to get a draft of the agreement out.  Do you think you will have a chance to send me the preamble stuff?

I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the ILA until June 15. I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I thought I would give you a heads up. David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.  If you have your preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now. Thanks, Kay (See attached file: MDEA ILA extension May 29.doc) PS  The salutation is to ""Gentlemen"".  Are the members of the commission and MDEA all men?  I don't want to commit a blunder. 
As I mentioned, I think the ""new and improved"" versions are better starting points, but here's what we used. I don't recall whether the concept of a development fee has been vetted with the accountants, as it wasn't applicable to the Intergen deal. Kay

Here's the revised form for the Blue Dog equipment: Kay 
Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal, tweaked a bit for lessons learned.  I will forward the updated letter agreement which has been improved also.  It relates to the Blue Dog turbines, so some of the defined terms are different.  I will also forward the Intergen docs so you can see some of the definitions, etc. One thing which wasn't addressed in the Intergen deal was the potential HSR issue (there wasn't one) which arises when the put or call option is exercised. I also have the TurboPark docs, which I can forward when it gets closer.  I don't know if I have the electronic versions of the other closing docs. Kay

Mom, I don't remember if I told you I will be home for spring break. Danielle wants us to go somewhere on our way home (she says Schlitterbahn, but I'm thinking it'll be coooooold!). So I could be home as early as Friday. Ashley has mentioned possibly going to her river house maybe on Thursday, but no matter what, I'll be home for a good chunk of spring break. Just thought I'd fill you in! Have a great rest of the trip. Love, Paige 
Sorry for the delay.  I ran into some complications. I left it ""in blank"" so we can fill in the commercial specifics depending on the purchaser, etc. Kay 
Hi Carolyn, Could you check this and see if I did anything stupid with the revisions: Thanks, 
Here's the revised form for the Blue Dog equipment: 
I'm still waiting on David Hunt to send me some stuff, which would really help move the document along.  I'll ask again if i can get it from him. There are still internal questions in it, which I have annotated. I'm happy for you to look at it fairly shortly, especially if you can give definitive commercial direction. Do you feel that the commercial team is  finished with the exhibits?  I haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work.  I know the bogey calc doc is a bit rough. Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff? Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge problem days for me.  When are you thinking of meeting with Beck?  Anyway to combine the two at once, given the short timeframe? Has Dave signed the extension, by the way? Kay 
Gentlemen, Does the Mississippi constitution impact the issue?  The munies are specifically citing Section  100 of the Mississippi constitution, and have faxed me an opinion of the Mississippi AG interpreting this section.

Kay: Relative to the Panda deal, 1.  What feedback have you received on the Portland legal question? 2.  What is the status of the GE breakout contract for the LV units?  Panda has asked (twice) for this and I would like to give them a timeline for its delivery.  We will need a day or two to redact the sensitive commercial data before delivery to Panda. 3.  I will call Panda this morning and float the $250K exclusivity fee concept. 4. Will the draft Letter Agreement be available today?  I have told Panda that this document would come first with the Facility Agreement and LLC Agreement to follow. 5. Stephen Thome is scheduled to be in Houston this afternoon.  I will bring him up to speed. Let me know on 1,2, and 4 above. Thanks, Fred 
Charlotte, Great story! Neil is at the Astrodome now. You might be able to reach him on his cell or by pager.  If I hear from him I will have him give you a call. I'm in Florida, and looking out my window I saw an alligator swim by. Wouldn't Michael go crazy? Bye, Kay ""Brashear, Charlotte"" <cbrashear@velaw.com> on 02/28/2001 08:28:16 AM 
I forgot to tell you this.  When we were at Blockbuster last time, Michael was trying to talk me into buying two videos.  I explained to him that we were spending Mom and Dad's money and that we had to stay within limits unless we had permission.  He decided on Dinosaur, but really, really wanted another monster video.  He then started his jury argument with me about how much I would enjoy watching that monster video at my apartment when he was not there.  A couple standing near us was cracking up laughing and said he is clearly going to be a lawyer when he grows up. Neil, I will probably take Michael to my apartment today so I can have something on cooking while he is watching videos.  You can call and confirm.  Since you are coming from the Astro Arena, won't it be just as convenient for you? ++++++CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE+++++ The information in this email may be confidential and/or privileged.

There's nothing special here.  Just cloudy. I took Roscoe in to get neutered.  Neil just couldn't handle it.  Men are so funny like that.  Now I'm going to run some errands.  I hope the weather gets better for this evening.  They are still covering the weather 100% on the tv, and it looks like it is getting better.  Still more of a deal south of here. 
I've got the crib, a playpen, red and blue check bumpers for the crib, a never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees (our trees were too tall), perhaps a jogging stroller (don't think we gave it away), and I don't know what else.  All have ""baby Carnahan"" on it.  Will she give the baby her last name?  That would be cool. I met someone (a guy)  named Kayne.  Yes, I know it looks like Kay, but I thought it sounded cool.  Kayne Carnahan.  Opps, sounds like a bull rider! ckm

Kay, Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to talk with Lee at GE. I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable. Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President. The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont? Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at LV Co-Gen? Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will let you know when I hear back from him. Fred Kay Mann@ENRON 02/26/2001 06:15 PM 
Fred, Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does GE know this is coming? What are you projecting for a closing date? We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract. Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much? If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I can get started on the process if you are ready. If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers. Kay Fred Mitro@ECT 02/26/2001 05:56 PM

I've just learned that this is a ""West"" deal for the sale of the LV Co Gen units. This deal was described as being the same as the Intergen deal.  King & Spalding helped me on that one, and when I thought this was an East deal I contacted Keffer for a conflicts check (there is none).  I haven't gone to Mark with it yet, though. We have forms, etc for this, and I'm happy to provide whatever support I can.  Please advise as to how you would like to proceed. Kay

Hi Carlos, Here's the PSA I mentioned. Kay 
Here is Trinity's MSA for your review.  Thank you for looking this over.  Let me know how you would like to proceed. Scott 
Scott, attached is a template that we have for master service agreements. Take and look and see what you think. Steve (See attached file: MSA Template.doc) - MSA Template.doc 
I have a PSA which needs to be made 97-10/TurboPark compliant.  Could you work on it?  I'll bring it around. Thanks, Kay 
See the attached Contract Status matrix. All of the proposed agreements in the top half of the matrix also have been blessed, as have the Secondary Agreements.. 
FYI, attached are the forms of design and engineering contracts for the Ft.Pierce project. The Technical Design Services Agreement will be cloned - one for the Facility improvements and one for the King Plant improvements, and the Black & Veatch agreement relates to design of the transmission upgrades. The two Technical Design Services Agreements ( with Stone and Webster ) will be amended and restated to be full blown Turbo Park compliant EPC contracts ( covering procurement and construction, as well as design ) with Stone and Webster ( assuming its estimate and delivery date are acceptable), at the time the project goes into Turbo Park. The Black & Veatch agreement will not be bifurcated, as Black & Veatch will not be the EPC contractor, but we will expect the EPC contractor for the transmission improvements to warrant the work. One issue we have is how to get Black & Veatch to give a Turbo Park compliant transmission improvements design warranty, but we may be able to get the EPC contractor to warrant the design and the improvements ( Turbo Park did not raise this issue, but it may in the future, so we need to be thinking about that ). The Black & Veatch agreement also may be assigned to FPUA, along with the transmission upgrades EPC contract, as FPUA will own the transmission improvements and supervise their construction. 
Attached are Turbo Park and accounting ""approved"" forms of the Technical Design Services Agreement between FPRP and Stone & Webster ( TDSA) and the Agreement for Professional Engineering Services between FPRP and Black & Veatch ( B&V Agreement). Each form has to now be fashioned to reflect the business deal/payment terms/etc. Note that the Scope of Work on the TDSA underwent substantial modification to conform with 97-10 requirements, and the attached draft Scope of Work only deals with the Facility ( as defined in the TDSA ), and not the ""improvements"" ( which term was included in the draft Tasking Letter from which the Scope of Work was fashioned).I assume we will need to ""clone"" this TDSA except for a different Scope of Work description to deal with such ""improvements"" other than the Facility ( ie, I assume these are the King Plant improvements). The TDSA is calculated to put as much of the Turbo Park-approved EPC in front of Stone & Webster at the earliest possible date, so that the amendment and restatement of the TDSA to make it a full blown Turbo Park EPC Contract will be more straightforward. Right now, it is contemplated FPRP would assign its interests as Construction Manager under the TDSA to ENA, and the TDSA would be concurrently amended and restated as set forth above, both at the time the FPRP goes into Phase II of Turbo Park. At the time FPRP goes into Phase I of Turbo Park, I believe the TDSA can remain an FPRP obligation ( like any other development agreement signed by a project entity that is subsequently transferred into Turbo Park). Since the TDSA now only involves soft cost expenditures, FPRP can sign it as soon as it is negotiated and agreed by Stone & Webster and before it goes into Phase I of Turbo Park. The B& V Agreement, which was modeled on Black & Veatch's agreement with FPUA, also can be signed prior to going into Phase I as soon as it is negotiated with Black & Veatch. Like the TDSA, there are commercial terms that need to be added. It was modeled on the FPUA Black & Veatch Agreement because that should speed negotiation with B & V on its terms, and we may want to assign the B & V Agreement to FPUA ( and they too would be comfortable with its terms). My understanding is that FPUA is supervising the transmission work and will be driving the design and engineering of the transmission facilities, so it may make sense for FPRP to assign the B & V Agreement to FPUA and simply retain the obligation to pay B & V ( up to a cap). I also have attached a revised version of the spreadsheet Mathew prepared listing FPRP contracts already entered into by FPRP ( the so-called secondary development agreements)  and those proposed to be entered into before we go into Phase I of Turbo Park. Herman and Lisa, let me know which of  the secondary agreements you have not previously reviewed ( those marked NO re your review ) that you need to review, and I will endeavor to furnish them to you. Let me know if you have any questions. 
The dynasty begins.... 
I will be in Jacksonville Florida this week negotiating a transaction with New Jersey Natural Gas.  It is a project development deal utilizing fuel cells.  The commercial lead is Jeff Ader.  I will leave tomorrow afternoon, returning on Friday afternoon. 
I would mention Carlos in the email, or have it shown as sent by him.  If it were me (and not him), I would have you send it under your own name, but explain that you are helping Carlos. 
Thank you. 
FYI.  We are staying at the Marriott Sawgrass, or something like that. ckm

Our current land option on the Pontiac site goes to June 11th, with a 6 month extension for $5000.  In order to enhance and maintain the value of the site (we're trying to sell it now) I have gotten Ben's authorization to secure an additional 12 month extension on the deal for $10,000. I spoke to the landowner - Dick Greene - and he indicated that they would consider it, although he has never been in favor of an option structure since  he is 80 years old and just wants the money from the sale.  The concept I pitched today was that we would pay them for the 6 month extension, and give them an additional $5000 now in exchange for adding another 12 month extension on the back.  At the time we exercise that 12 month extension we would pay them another $5000.  He said he would have to hear what his lawyer said in this regard, but I think its close to a deal.  Perhaps we could arrange a conference call with Karen Way at Piper-Rudnick as she has dealt extensively with their lawyer Ed Legner.  Its good timing to hit him now, since he does a lot of tax work so he will want to wrap us up quickly. As regards accounting issues, the total exercise price is 117 acres * $4500 / ac. = $526,500, and 5% = $26,325.  Total option premiums (including this extension I am proposing) will be $20,000.  I believe we may also need to amend the original option language to make it clear that the option fee is not part of the price. 
Good afternoon, I'm attaching for your review a revised LOI. Thanks, Kay 
Mr. Sorte, Michael Brown and Janelle Schueur have requested that I forward this confidentiality agreement to your attention. Regards, Kay Mann

Hi Steve, I wanted to send this to you before I send it out to others, since I feel like there were changes we had discussed that somehow didn't make in the last draft.   Guess you can say this is a sanity check!  If it looks good to you, then I will send it out, unless you prefer to make distribution. Kay

My opinion is that there is that the letter agreement is not ready to be sent out, and won't be for a day or two.  It can't be sent out until the CA is returned to you signed. 
Mr. Sorte, Michael Brown and Janelle Schueur have requested that I forward this confidentiality agreement to your attention. Regards, Kay Mann 
Here's the CA you requested. 
Yes, because they are deducting pretax dollars for parking. 
I know I will be hearing from Gregg about this soon.  Any progress? Thanks, 
I'm worrying again about summer.  Maybe we should check out the Y on Voss to see what they have, if anything.  What do you think? 
Hi there, Does anyone have a Finance/Accounting blessed professional services agreement? Thanks, 
Mercury's Mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the best-selling Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle. The problem was, Ford's Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases, was even more expensive. For 2002, Mercury has attempted to further distinguish their sport-ute from the popular Explorer. The result is a fine SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content. This near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210 horsepower or a 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies. Both engines come mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The new V8 offers copious and refined power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers. Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out, and the results are pleasing. Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A-pillars forward, its ""New Edge"" theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps. Meanwhile, the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents, lending a distinctive, high-tech flavor to this former Explorer clone. Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic, however. An all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame design debuts this year. This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches - thereby making room for a third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance to 9.2 inches. At the same time, ride and handling have been dramatically improved. The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits flatter cornering characteristics. A 2.5-inch wider stance improves handling even more, while increasing interior room. Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have also been improved in the 2002 Mountaineer. A 50-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment, although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does intrude through the floor. New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six-way power adjustable driver's seat, along with optional adjustable pedals, heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors. Among the Mountaineer's new safety features are optional side curtain airbags, a stiffer body shell and a lower front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles. Later in the model year, rollover protection sensors, and a new AdvanceTrac traction/stability control system will also be available. The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content, powerful engine choices and improved rear suspension. There are plenty of SUVs on the market, but if you want an Explorer, yet can't stomach the thought of owning the golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles, the Mountaineer just might float

This place amazes me!  Thanks for  your help.  I have no patience for it. We went to Michael's school conference today.  His teacher raved about how everyone just loves Michael. He is so sweet.  He is staying with my folks this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.  I can't wait for him to come home.  Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.  I've got to take Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.  Plus, I spent last weekend with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.  I hope to  PURGE the house of all the junk I have.  I hope it is raining, because  that is great cleaning weather.  I want to see bare space in my closet.  I think I'll call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need. I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.  Next Thursday is Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.  Do you know anywhere that can enlarge a photo and mount it on a board? I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.  Go figure. I need to send off my Tx tax and bar dues today.  I'll want to fed ex, just in case you are sending anyone else's today.

Speaking of tennis, Michael asked Neil if he can teach him how to play.  Neil said no, since he doesn't know how.  I told him I can play, and now Michael thinks I should play with him, then he will teach Neil.  Very elaborate plan! Remember how we used to hit tennis balls against the house?  Can you believe we never broke a window?  We have a detached garage, but the door is metal. I can't imagine how loud that would be! I remember trying to encourage Paige to swim, bike, whatever.  Pushing NEVER helped.  She can swim and ride, so I guess it worked out ok.  She never showed any interest in playing on a sports team, even though she used to go to my softball games.  Whatever. Time to go home! Love,  Kay ""Lisa Clarke"" <lisa@casa-de-clarke.com> on 02/20/2001 05:05:50 PM 
Hi! It's good to hear from you. This is just a quick note, that I'm not sure you'll even get in time. But, I just got off the phone with Mother and she asked me to ask you to call her when you get home, or she'll call you around 6:30. Dad's sonogram is scheduled for next Tuesday at 3:45. I think that's what she wants to tell you. Well, Annie is outside pounding the tennis ball against the wall. I guess I should go and give her a glove to pitch to. Oh, by the way. When she was Michael's age we signed her up for t-ball. She spent the first practice in tears. So, we pulled her off and waited before we started her. Now she loves playing the game. Enjoy the beautiful afternoon! I love you! lisa ----------

those of you who do not know, trutta is a kind of trout) 
Pop quiz to follow... 
those of you who do not know, trutta is a kind of trout) this is going out to a broad group and may not be relevant to some, but please be aware that other ENA assets may go into the velocity/condor structure at a couple points this year. also we can all pray (i think it is ok to use this word in the current political climate and in a secular sense, as i think our interests are aligned on this) that the ENE stock price goes up and for more room in the raptor vehicle so we may see more raptor hedges. 1.. as most of you are aware, the majority of ENA's merchant assets are in our project velocity structure. just to make sure that we confuse everyone, we use condor/whitewing/velocity/trutta names interchangeably although occasionally there are some distinctions (which i won't bore you with the details about so you can disavow all knowledge if you have/need/want to). just so you get the right lingo, trutta is the name of the ENA subsidiary where these assets now have a home. ENA, under a servicing agreement, is the servicer of the assets. i am attaching for your information the servicing guidelines in the agreement. the major restriction is that ENA cannot  sell assets for less than the contributed value into the structure. any EARLY warning of a potential sale of any of these assets would be greatly appreciated so we can check whether any restrictions apply and be ready, as there are some logistics involved. an email to donna lowry, mary heinitz and myself would be wonderful. if you do not do this, you may get on donna's list. of course i can't speak for her as to the repercussions envisioned, but let me suffice it to say that i am glad i am not on her list. at least that i know of. 2. a number of these assets also have raptor hedges in place in addition to being in the velocity structure. only the portion of the investment that was on ENA's balance sheet was hedged. if an asset is sold that has been ""raptorized"", the swap will need to be promptly terminated/notional amounts adjusted etc. again, give us as much notice as you can. 3. we also need notice (AHEAD OF TIME) of any follow on investments in the same merchant assets, exchanges of our interest or further fundings because STUFF will have to be done. i will not bore you with the details, but this STUFF cannot be done in ONE MINUTE contrary to the popular opinion of some business types whose names i will not mention here. we also are obligated to provide quarterly reports of the investments which describe any modifications to the investments during that calendar quarter. the first report is due april 11, 2001 for the first quarter of this year. we will be asking for your input with respect to your investments at the end of march. 4. lists of assets currently in velocity and in raptor are attached fyi.

Here are my initial comments: There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help. Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to obtain project financing. Kay 
Bronco is on the sofa upstairs. ""Neil Mann"" <nmann@erac.com> on 02/20/2001 11:40:26 AM Please respond to <nmann@erac.com> 
Good morning! Boy, it's been non stop since I walked in. Someone broke into Brett's and Stephen's offices last night. They trashed a lot of offices and stole small amounts of cash from some employees desks. Nothing really big taken. There were several laptops out and they found the keys to several cars but left all of it alone. One of the cars was Nancy Bs new suburban. Doesn't make sense... Michael is very concerned about Bronco and that Charlotte won't be able to find him tonight when they get home.  He is really taken with Bronco... Gota go. NM 
Discussion re documentation of asset construction projects 
No problem.  I appreciate the help in trying to keep track of it. 
Hi Shirley, Is this meeting still set for tomorrow?  I heard a rumor that it had been changed again, but I don't know if it is correct. 
re documentatiuon of asset construction projects

I think it can be accomplished so long as we have no obligation to agree to any particular terms in the definitive docs.  I don't see why we would need to DASH exclusivity. See you soon, Kay 
Hi! I was off work yesterday, so I just got your email.  You gotta love President's Day.  We went to the rodeo last night, and I'm really tired today.  I'm too old to go out on a school night! Mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on Dad's neck to check out the blockage.  When I talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled. Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do.  Sounds dangerous to me, but I don't really know anything about it. Too bad about Katie's asthma.  I was worried that Paige has it, but she went through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it.  Just really bad allergies that make her wheeze.  I'm not sure of the difference, but I believe this dr. Michael still isn't interested in playing team sports.  We asked this spring and he said not yet.  I don't know why he doesn't want to play, but I don't want to push him either.  Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids play.  Maybe we can come watch Annie play. Neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week. Everything else is business as usual around here. Say ""hey"" to everyone. Love, 
Pete, These comments are from our Finance group.  These are FYI at this time; further discussions to follow. Kay 
Talk to you when you get back. ""Keffer, John"" <JKeffer@KSLAW.com> on 02/19/2001 05:34:35 PM 
I'm going to Atlanta tomorrow so I'm going to have to miss our lunch.  I'll call you to reschedule. Confidentiality Notice This message is being sent by or on behalf of a lawyer.

I worked out for the first time in a bizillion years.  Oh my gosh.  At least I know how to work out, and I know not to take it to the limit the first time out, but it is still hard to move.  I didn't exercise my legs or my back much, figuring that's what I'll need most this weekend for yard work.  I think I saw our neighbor Kim playing basketball.  I took an abs class, since I need to get my abs (and back) in shape to protect myself from injury.  I could really mess myself up after such a long hiatus! The Met was plenty convenient.  They have a  spa there now, with all the spa stuff.

Folks - Scheduling a meeting time is becoming nightmarish.  Feb 19th and 20th are no longer possible.  In the following chart, please indicate your available dates and e-mail back to me as soon as possible. Hopefully, building a power plant will be easier than coordinating schedules.

Hi. My meetings in Florida are scheduled for Feb 28, March 1 and March 2.  I do not know when I will be leaving, but if there is a way to leave on the morning of the 28th, I will do so. More details to follow! 
Hot off the presses.  I'm looking at it now. 
Gentlemen, I think we also need to be certain that we have a decent amount of discretion in whether we close, otherwise we have to consider the DASH process at this time. Kay 
As you know, Enron and Peoples jointly own enovate. Our group in Chicago is looking to manage some funds which belong to enovate. We had initially envisioned having a cash management policy which would outline how Enron would invest the funds, etc.  The other owner of enovate, Peoples, has proposed that we use the attached document in connection with this arrrangement.  This is taking me a little far afield of my area of expertise, so I'm writing you guys for input, direction, etc. Suggestions? Gregg do you want to correct any of what I wrote? Kay 
Hi Gregg, I've sent John an email (didn't have his number).  If you have it I will follow up  with a phone call. I was out yesterday (jury duty called) and Janet was out-of-pocket this afternoon.  I'll try to track her down tomorrow. I will forward the finance agreement to a finance lawyer and tax, and will send you a copy so you'll know who is in the loop. Kay 
Hi John, I haven't been able to find you number.  I wanted to discuss the confidentiality agreements, and whether you envision that other confidentiality agreements may be necessary or required. Thanks, 
I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of where my computer would be if I was there.  It is a lawyers name (which of course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.  It may be David something or other.  Could you email me that name and number? Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders? Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran. 
fyi 
Carlos tells me that he has had difficulty forwarding emails, so I'm sending this along. Kay 
Ben: Attached below are PSEG's comments on the Kendall [Plano] draft Purchase Agreement and their proposed 1 page Option Letter. I have asked Carlos Sole (ENA legal) to review these documents and let me know if the form of the Letter is acceptable to ENA legal.  PSEG indicated to me this afternoon that they are prepared to deposit the $300K in an account designated by Enron. I have scheduled a call with PSEG at 1:30 (Houston time) tomorrow to discuss the letter and their due diligence/legal comments.  My first priority is to execute the Letter if we are comfortable with the form.  I did notice on my first pass that the Letter did not include language on the $3 MM Purchase Price. I have set a meeting with Carlos at 9:00 am (Houston time) to go over the Letter and PSEG's comments.  Let me know if you would like to tie in by phone for that meeting (this applies to all parties on the above distribution). Fred 
One of us can. Fred Mitro@ECT 02/15/2001 04:47 PM 
Kathleen: Please check the previous CA's with Dynegy to determine if they were unilateral or bilateral.  If they were unilateral then this form looks fine. If they were bilateral, then we should adopt that format in the CA that we are preparing to send out to Dynegy. Kay:  If Kathleen is out of the office tomorrow, can Carlos pull this CA together? Fred Enron North America Corp. 
Hi there, On the options we should delete the reference to the Federal Arbitration Act, so that the sentence with that reference ends with ""binding arbitration"".  I changed it on the confidentiality agreement, but missed it here.  Carlos caught it. Kay 
Choice of law doesn't impact place of arbitration.  We just need a starting position... 
More for the contract... 
Hi Pete, Here's some language to be included in the form contract. Thanks, Kay
