We will do it.  Maureen and I have already talked about the Freeman meeting and we are making Steve hotel reservations, wherever we put Ken. Rosie Janel Guerrero 04/25/2001 02:19 PM 
Since Steve Kean is planning to accompany Ken on his meetings next week in CA, please be sure to cc Maureen McVicker on all meetings that are scheduled so she can manage Steve's calendar. Thanks. 
Thanks, Janel.  I hope to hear from the Governor's office late this afternoon. Rosie Janel Guerrero 04/27/2001 02:39 PM 
Just so we're all on the same page......Dasovich will arrive in Houston on Monday (mid-day) and will travel with Dr. Lay beginning on Wednesday (to Austin) and then on to LAX, Sacramento etc.  Steve said there really isn't time to have a pre-briefing so any questions that Ken has will have to be addressed enroute to CA. Rosalee....we're giving Steve the briefing book today so he can review over the weekend and we'll have a final copy to Ken before he departs next week. 
I received a return call from Lelanie in Governor Davis' office this evening.  She said the Governor wanted to invite Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling to a meeting the Governor is having at 2:00 p.m. in Sacramento on May 2 with a lot of CEOs.  I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3.   I transferred her to Sherri and called Ken.  Ken wanted me to try to get more specific information, which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra, Williams, CalPine, Duke, Dynegy, and Reliant.  She also said since the Governor has worked with Ken, she thought he might prefer that he attend.  Ken said to let you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it.  He said one thought might be that he'd do that meeting and maybe Jeff could do the one in L.A. on May 2. Talk to you Monday. Rosie Janel Guerrero 04/27/2001 02:39 PM

One more e-mail!  I have calls into all the offices.  I need to call Crawford's office back late on Monday (talked to his Chief of Staff - Matt Back).  We left it that the others will call me back. Confirmed are:  John Bryson - 3:30 on May 2 in L.A. (I have a call in to move that one later, if possible). David Freeman - 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on May 3 in Sacramento;  Robert Hertzberg - 1:00 p.m. on May 3 in Sacramento; Bob Glynn - 9:00 a.m. on May 4 in San Francisco. More later. 
I just heard from Matt Back in Assemblyman John Campbell's office.  Ken has an appointment at 2:00 - 3:00 following the meeting with Hertzberg. Jim Brulte is scheduled at 10:30  that morning, but they would only give me 30 minutes.  I am trying to schedule John Burton at 11:00 as they will be in the same building.  I have left another message for David Cox's scheduler. Governor Davis' office was incredulous that no one from Enron was attending his meeting.  But, she said she would call me back to try to schedule something.

Ken Lay will be traveling to Japan - departing Guadalajara, Mexico on October 29, arriving late October 30.  He will be available for meetings on October 31 and November 1.  He can stay over for a time on November 2 and all day if necessary, but he is trying to get back to Columbia, Missouri for a dinner on the evening of November 3, so would be good if he could depart by noon on November 2. Hope this allows time for all the meetings and the office opening.  I look forward to receiving more information. Rosie Steven J Kean@EES 08/31/2000 12:28 PM Sent by: Steven J Kean@EES 
I spoke with Jeff and he is not going to be available for the speech on the 26th.  Do we pass or is there an alternative?  Can we get done what we need to get done with Ken's visit the following week? Nicholas O'Day 08/31/2000 06:01 AM 
Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan. While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services. kind regards Nicholas O'Day 08/29/2000 07:43 PM 
Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards 
Ken wanted to make sure you saw this speech. 
Rosalee: I understand that Ken Lay and Senator Hagel will be together this evening at the Horatio Alger event I believe in Williamsburg. The attachment is the speech Chuck gave this week before ESI and Ken may find it helpful in some discussion tonight. Joe 
I thought you might be interested in seeing a copy of a speech on international energy policy that Sen. Hagel gave today at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, D.C. - hagelesi.rtf 
Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you. Rosie 
I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy 
Kathy, Eileen and I were most pleased to have the opportunity to donate to Southern Tier (NY) Hospice Corporation via the Charity Gift Card that Enron Executive Committee sent us.  Enron displays uncommon leadership in humanitarian activities as well as the business world.  Our thanks go to Ken and the Executive Committee. Very truly yours, Buddy and Eileen Leech

I received a return call from Lelanie in Governor Davis' office this evening.  She said the Governor wanted to invite Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling to a meeting the Governor is having at 2:00 p.m. in Sacramento on May 2 with a lot of CEOs.  I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3.   I transferred her to Sherri and called Ken.  Ken wanted me to try to get more specific information, which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra, Williams, CalPine, Duke, Dynegy, and Reliant.  She also said since the Governor has worked with Ken, she thought he might prefer that he attend.  Ken said to let you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it.  He said one thought might be that he'd do that meeting and maybe Jeff could do the one in L.A. on May 2. Talk to you Monday. Rosie Janel Guerrero 04/27/2001 02:39 PM 
Just so we're all on the same page......Dasovich will arrive in Houston on Monday (mid-day) and will travel with Dr. Lay beginning on Wednesday (to Austin) and then on to LAX, Sacramento etc.  Steve said there really isn't time to have a pre-briefing so any questions that Ken has will have to be addressed enroute to CA. Rosalee....we're giving Steve the briefing book today so he can review over the weekend and we'll have a final copy to Ken before he departs next week.

Rosalee - attached are some talking points prepared by our German gas origination team.  They would like to have these forwarded to Ken in Davos, where the person we would like Ken to speak with is also in attendance.  That is Mr. Ulf Boge, the President of the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) of Germany.  The FCO is about to dismiss a complaint we filed, on rather specious procedural grounds.  We regard this as an important case, and if Ken could have word with Boge about how important we regard this case, it would help.   thanks  mcs

They would like to have these forwarded to Ken in Davos, where the person we would like Ken to speak with is also in attendance.  That is Mr. Ulf Boge, the President of the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) of Germany.  The FCO is about to dismiss a complaint we filed, on rather specious procedural grounds.

Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you. Rosie 
I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy 
Kathy, Eileen and I were most pleased to have the opportunity to donate to Southern Tier (NY) Hospice Corporation via the Charity Gift Card that Enron Executive Committee sent us.  Enron displays uncommon leadership in humanitarian activities as well as the business world.  Our thanks go to Ken and the Executive Committee. Very truly yours, Buddy and Eileen Leech

Ken Lay will be traveling to Japan - departing Guadalajara, Mexico on October 29, arriving late October 30.  He will be available for meetings on October 31 and November 1.  He can stay over for a time on November 2 and all day if necessary, but he is trying to get back to Columbia, Missouri for a dinner on the evening of November 3, so would be good if he could depart by noon on November 2. Hope this allows time for all the meetings and the office opening.  I look forward to receiving more information. Rosie Steven J Kean@EES 08/31/2000 12:28 PM Sent by: Steven J Kean@EES 
I spoke with Jeff and he is not going to be available for the speech on the 26th.  Do we pass or is there an alternative?  Can we get done what we need to get done with Ken's visit the following week? Nicholas O'Day 08/31/2000 06:01 AM 
Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan. While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services. kind regards Nicholas O'Day 08/29/2000 07:43 PM 
Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards

FYI.? The complete version of the following paper is available on my web pa= ge=20 at: www.whogan.com ????????ON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGH STRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIA Scott Harvey and William W. Hogan April 24, 2001 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Beginning in June of 2000, the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the=20 California electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies t= o=20 correct the apparent market failures.? The public debate and policy=20 discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal= =20 problem amenable to regulatory solution.? However, design of effective=20 policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the=20 diagnosis of the underlying causes.? High prices attributable largely to an= =20 exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular= =20 market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory=20 action.? By contrast, high prices attributable to bad electricity market=20 design would indicate a need for changes in the design.? High prices=20 attributable to higher fuel prices, environmental constraints and capacity= =20 shortages, on the other hand, would prompt actions to address the cost of= =20 fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should=20 receive the appropriate price signal for conservation. Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some=20 capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market.? B= ut=20 charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as=20 exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply.?=20 Likewise, refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke= t=20 power.? Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers, t= he=20 focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal=20 generators in California. On its face, the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the=20 exercise of market power could be important.? But at the same time the data= =20 show that there have been profound changes in the California market such th= at=20 the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than= =20 demand has grown.? If anything, thermal generators that hit annual output= =20 limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of 2000.?=20 Furthermore, the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout= =20 the western market, both on and off peak,? indicate that if the exercise of= =20 market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels= =20 unprecedented in this or other electricity markets.? In short, this is a=20 complicated story, and there is ample room for further investigation of the= =20 data and diagnosis of causes. Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals= =20 that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of=20 electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the=20 simplifying assumptions.? If strategic withholding were large and pervasive= ,=20 then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored= .?=20 But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear, and any finding o= f=20 the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the=20 California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use= d=20 in the analysis of the data.? For example, annual limits on production=20 dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha= n=20 direct incremental costs; hence, examinations of output decisions for=20 individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete.? The variation in re= al=20 time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output= =20 compared to the expectations given day-ahead prices; hence, with capacity= =20 constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal=20 production at average prices.? Limits on the ramping rate of generation=20 units, start-up costs, minimum load costs and other operational=20 inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twenty-four separate= =20 hours and must be analyzed chronologically, recognizing these factors.? And= =20 so on.? Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the=20 previous evidence.? Unfortunately, the real details are neither simple nor= =20 incidental. It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly= =20 available data.? A fuller analysis would require data available only to the= =20 California Independent System Operator, and has not been done.? Many factor= s=20 contributed to higher electricity prices in California, and the market powe= r=20 theme is only, at most, part of the story.? The import of the previous=20 analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the=20 California electricity market but, rather, to suggest that it might be=20 important.? The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha= t=20 market power has not been exercised in the electricity market? but, rather,= =20 to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b= e=20 significant.?

By contrast, there is general agreement that the California electricity=20 market design is =01&seriously flawed.=018? Furthermore, there is evidence = that the=20 policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an= =20 already serious market collapse.? Hence, without dismissing the possibility= =20 of the exercise of market power, the principal policy focus should be on=20 fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market= =20 design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown. Separate from market power mitigation, California should pay its bills, rai= se=20 incremental prices to retail customers, and move as quickly as possible to= =20 operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al= l=20 that includes unit commitment, day-ahead scheduling, and real-time=20 balancing.? Although not a panacea, these steps would address immediate=20 problems and set the stage for longer-term initiatives to expand generation= =20 capacity, transmission infrastructure, and the reach of an efficient market= =20 to the western interconnected grid.

I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3.

I hope to introduce many of you at the meeting, so please plan to sit up front.  Seats will be held for you. This will be a very important meeting.  I look forward to seeing you there. Regards, Ken 
Ken Lay will be traveling to Japan - departing Guadalajara, Mexico on October 29, arriving late October 30.  He will be available for meetings on October 31 and November 1.  He can stay over for a time on November 2 and all day if necessary, but he is trying to get back to Columbia, Missouri for a dinner on the evening of November 3, so would be good if he could depart by noon on November 2. Hope this allows time for all the meetings and the office opening.  I look forward to receiving more information. Rosie Steven J Kean@EES 08/31/2000 12:28 PM Sent by: Steven J Kean@EES 
I spoke with Jeff and he is not going to be available for the speech on the 26th.  Do we pass or is there an alternative?  Can we get done what we need to get done with Ken's visit the following week? Nicholas O'Day 08/31/2000 06:01 AM 
Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan. While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services. kind regards Nicholas O'Day 08/29/2000 07:43 PM 
Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards

Rosalee - attached are some talking points prepared by our German gas origination team.  They would like to have these forwarded to Ken in Davos, where the person we would like Ken to speak with is also in attendance.  That is Mr. Ulf Boge, the President of the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) of Germany.  The FCO is about to dismiss a complaint we filed, on rather specious procedural grounds.  We regard this as an important case, and if Ken could have word with Boge about how important we regard this case, it would help.   thanks  mcs

The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards 
Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you. Rosie 
I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy 
Kathy, Eileen and I were most pleased to have the opportunity to donate to Southern Tier (NY) Hospice Corporation via the Charity Gift Card that Enron Executive Committee sent us.  Enron displays uncommon leadership in humanitarian activities as well as the business world.  Our thanks go to Ken and the Executive Committee. Very truly yours, Buddy and Eileen Leech 
RYI - re:  Executive Committee holiday gift.  This is a thank you from Governor Ann Richards' staff. Rosie 
Ms. Mayfield, Thank you for the Charity Gift holiday greeting card. Governor Richards chose to donate to Meals on Wheels. On behalf of Governor Richards and Meals on Wheels, thank you and best wishes on the New Year. Sincerely, Sara Allen Assistant

Thank you for the Charity Gift Card.  I decided to donate the gift to the Depelchin Children's Center. 
Steve, Ken asked if you will return the call to Paul Beckner.  He said he doesn't recall a recent conversation. Paul Beckner with Citizens for a Sound Economy was referred by Jack Oliver to speak with you regarding a follow-up to a conversation you had with Boyden Gray.  202-783-3870  tw

Great--and I will be inspired with my draft of his remarks. Rosie, could you call the phone number on the invitation, ask for Herb Bateman (he is the director), and tell him of the commitment? I am out of town and do not have their number, and they called me wondering about Ken's decision last Friday. Thanks, - Rob Kenneth Lay on 08/04/2000 12:40:45 PM Sent by: Rosalee Fleming 
Hi Rob - Ken said ""If you'll prepare the remarks, I'll be happy to do this"". Rosie Rob Bradley 07/19/2000 09:51 AM 
If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to become the employer of choice in the marketplace. You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman of the event. - Rob 
Hi Jaime - Thanks for the information about the dinner.  Ken said that he would be flying from Aspen to New York (or Washington, if that's the city).  He said he would very much like to meet with you for 30 - 45 minutes before the dinner for a briefing. Thanks. Rosie Jaime Alatorre 08/08/2000 10:33 AM Sent by: Jaime Alatorre

Hi Kenny: Bonny sent me your E-mail address and so I am trying it out. Sorry we could not make it to the party. The temperature is very warm here in Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently and it looks like it is doing fine. I am particularly interested in your venture into the fiber optics communications business and the windpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular business last year and I think the land line company will be sold soon. We sold to Allied Telephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other engineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together about 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system from East to West across Kansas. That was sold with the Cellular.

Dear Ken: Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this event. Our theme is ""2001: An Energy Odyssey."" We are using the conference to showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to clearly define these major themes and priorities than you. I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t= o heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in markets on behalf of enterprises. The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an= d university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo= u up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc= e (at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas. Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project, which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel= p identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary session, ""Sustaining Development"" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn thinking around with our re-phrasing). I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We look forward to having you with us next April!

The next World Economic Forum will be held September 11-13 in Melbourne.  I have received information from the Control Risks Group that several anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale clashes between demonstrators and police are expected. If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel accomodations.  Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents if you desire. Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be rescheduled. Regards, Mike Hicks 
Hi Mr. Moore - I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation until September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for several weeks, it is already pretty booked up. I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. Lay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by e-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Cindy Olson,  would be available to meet with you on August 28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department. Please advise. Rosalee ""Charles Moore"" <CHMoore1@email.msn.com> on 08/21/2000 04:14:08 PM 
I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving. ? I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name just a few. ? I look forward to hearing from you. ? ? P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4. 
Diane, I will definitely show this to Ken, but he has a Dain Rauscher presentation near the Galleria at 8:00 a.m. that morning, so I know he can't attend. Rosie Diane Bazelides@AZURIX 08/22/2000 03:01 PM 
On September 19th Dr. Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific affairs for the national Alzheimer's Association, will be in Houston to provide an update on some of the new and successful research underway for Alzheimer's disease.  He'll also be meeting with local reseachers to learn what they're doing in order to support and potentially fund their work. Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise funds for this very cause, Phil and I are hosting a breakfast so you can hear firsthand how your money is being spent.  No pledge cards will be handed out at the door--just juice, coffee and maybe a bagel.  Please join us to hear an update from Dr. Thies on September  19 from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in the Enron Building, Room 49C1.  Please RSVP to Adriana Wynn at X55176.

Hi Mr. Yergin - I just wanted to make sure that you knew that Ken does plan to do this.  He did talk to Governor Knowles. Thanks. Rosalee Dan Yergin <dyergin@CERA.com> on 08/15/2000 11:22:38 AM 
Dear Ken, It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in Aspen.? I'm working at it! Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event. They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have you in that featured role in it works for your schedule. It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in further on what they would like to accomplish. If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, that would be great. On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. Best, Dan

With regard to working out a convenient date to meet with  you, Rosalee has suggested that your week of September 4 is pretty well  booked-up. Would either September 11 or 13 work? After that I have to join Norm  Blake at the Olympics in Sydney. While all of this can de done by phone, as  deputy to the chairmen, I'm making every effort to meet (albeit briefly) with  each Committee member. If you are willing to host a meeting in Houston, I want  to make every effort to have Paul Newman in  attendance.

Mr. Hines - To get back with you re: your question about some kind of Futures/Options market in the commercial space market, Ken Lay said that to approach Jeff Skilling about it is absolutely the right approach. Rosalee Jeff_Hines@hines.com on 08/28/2000 06:05:38 PM 
I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this should ""be the Authority's idea."".  One issue is how much of our fee would apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential. If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please give me a call at 713-966-2606. Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron. 
Ken Lay asked me to advise you that he can't do this one, but would consider other dates. Rosalee pway@wayholding.com on 08/16/2000 03:25:57 PM 
Ken, I understand that you are trying to clear your sch. to speak at the River Oaks Breakfast Club on Oct. 26.  I hope it works out because I always hear what is going on at Enron.  Peter - C.DTF 
Dear Dean Walker - Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine. 2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on October 13. Thanks. Rosalee ""Walker, Bruce J."" <Walker@missouri.edu> on 08/28/2000 04:17:56 PM 
Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13. The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient way of reaching you, is two-fold: 1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness. Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into Harold Hook to seek his input. A few points of elaboration: * ""Distinguished"" is a standard adjective in the titles of such positions. * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my approval. * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October 13. This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength, (2) allows me to avoid any ""turf battles"" (either within the college or with Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name. 2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program. Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed (probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship. I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you will serve as the keynote speaker. If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is 573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972. Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there. Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.) 
Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire week of September 26. The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.? I look forward to hearing from you. 
Mr. Lay responded that he is unable to attend.  I know that you already have that message as someone has called, but I wanted to let you know also. Rosalee Fleming ""Slade, Priscilla D"" <Slade_PD@tsu.edu> on 08/22/2000 11:42:28 AM 
Hello Mr. Lay, It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September 16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing, boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY. I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining us. Sincerely, Priscilla

To the attention of: Dr Kenneth L. Lay Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ENRON CORPORATION Mexico Meeting 2000 Managing New Expectations and Old Challenges Mexico City, Mexico 4-5 December Dear Dr Lay, Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy. In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence of the future key cabinet members and state governors. As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial relationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues for the country's main industries. Please consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information will be updated as soon as it becomes available. For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at (41 22) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org (  ) Please send me more information on the conditions for participation. (  ) Please send information to: - Name: - Position: - Company: - Tel.: - Fax: - E-mail: ( XX ) I am unable to participate in the Mexico Meeting 2000.

Hi Jeff - Ken asked me to advise you that he will be out of the city on March 21. Thanks for including him. Rosalee Jeffrey McClellan@ECT 08/31/2000 10:55 AM 
Good morning Ken, Just wanted to take a moment to thank you for being the ""Honorary Chair"" for the Cougars@Enron golf tournament to be held on March 21, 2001.  I enjoyed meeting you at the ""Enron Excellence Awards"" presentation and genuinely appreciate your support.  When we spoke, you said that you may not be able to play in the tournament.  I certainly understand, but if you are available to play (or make an appearance at the dinner afterward), it would most beneficial to our outcome.  Please let me know if you are available. Thanks, Jeff McClellan x34779

Cynthia, Ken said to tell you that he told David Sokol we would probably oppose it. Rosie Cynthia Sandherr 09/08/2000 04:49 PM 
Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating. MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed. The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 2944). Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was Senator Kerrey's idea. It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least

Dr. Lay: We need a bio of you to include in the program for the Herbert J. Davenport program on October 13. I have attached the bio of you that we used in the brochure announcing the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment. Perhaps, with a few adjustments, it will be suitable for this current need. Please review the bio and send me any changes you would like made as soon as possible.

Hi Liz - Your Dad said to tell you that it would be fine for Elizabeth to review the document.  Her secretary told me that her e-mail address is: elabano@enron.com.  I'm copying her on this in case you have any difficulty with sending it. Rosie Elizabeth Lay <lizard_ar@yahoo.com> on 02/09/2000 12:52:35 PM 
Dad, I've drafted a Interim Construction Financing document for the loan we previously discussed. However, I would like to have it reviewed by Elizabeth Labonowski (assuming she has handled some of your loans and real estate interests previously) if you don't mind. Unfortunately, since my contract experience is generally in Take or Pay or join venture projects, it is lengthier than you wanted. Please let me know if I can have the go ahead to contact Elizabeth and if you could have Rosalee send me Elizabeth's e-mail address, that would be very helpful.

Hi Calvin - just to let you know that Ken is going to be traveling until 10/3, but I will print this out for him to see. Rosie 
Good morning - I was out during the timeframe that this was sent, but Ken Lay did not give it back to us.  He is traveling now and totally inaccessible (on vacation) during the time of the meeting, so he will not be participating.

Dear  Ken, I am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to testify in Congress early on September 28, and he felt unable to make our session as originally planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with him prior to -- or in conjunction with -- the final report. For those who may have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience. In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to 7 but not with the dinner. Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is different from the previous two meetings. Wednesday, September 27 from 5 to 7 p.m. McKinsey & Company 52 East 52nd Street, 23rd Floor New York, NY Check in on 23rd floor with Carol Hubbard, who will direct you to the conference room Phone: 212-446-8836 Attached is the draft of our final report, prepared by Tim Koller. It will be the subject of the meeting.  We will want to gather your comments on the following: 1.  Do you agree with the substance of this draft? 2.  Are there points that should receive more or less emphasis? 3.  Are there any other issues you would like to raise? 4.  Is there anything else about the drafting and presentation that you would like to comment on? We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd like to have ready by the end of October. Originally you said that you would not be able to make the meeting. Could you let us know if your plans have changed and you can now come or participate by phone?  See below for reply. ____ I will be there ____  I will participate by phone ____ I cannot make it at all but will e-mail comments by September 30 Many thanks, Jeff

Executive Committee Weekly Meeting 
Good morning, Joe.  Ken is on a cruise, so is not available, but I did talk to Steve (he is traveling, but said he is trying to get in touch with you). Apparently, everything is still internal.  He said everything is fine, so hopefully, you don't need to be concerned. Talk to you soon. Rosie Joe Hillings 09/25/2000 08:53 AM 
Ken: I have ""heard"" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and deserving manner. I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the office construction is not totally functioning. Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status than I have been. I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves. Joe 
Good morning, Michael.  Will there be enough funds to help Sue without Shell's if I wait until Mr. Lay returns on October 3?  I have not been very successful getting faxes through to the ship, so would prefer not to have to bother him with this unless absolutely necessary. Rosalee ""Telle, Michael S."" <mtelle@velaw.com> on 09/25/2000 06:28:00 PM 
Mr. Lay-- I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by the partners to the referendum campaign. Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this procedure with Sue Walden. With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of these laws provides that ""a person may not knowingly make or authorize a political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the person actually making the contribution . . . .""   Pending a better understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the partnership's account. Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have any questions regarding the foregoing. Sincerely, Michael S. Telle

Mr. Lay-- During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation against other contributions that they solicited. After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting contributions to the Arena referendum campaign. Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that would be solicited by the Rockets. Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and don't hesitate to ever ask for a ""quid pro quo"" from us.

Hi Colin - Ken Lay asked me to advise you that this is fine with him. Rosie Colin Skellett@AZURIX 10/26/2000 10:20 AM Sent by: Lisa Hobbs@AZURIX 
Ken Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we should say a polite ""no"". The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, Managing Director of Lurgi Invent. Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent. Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is the right answer. Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to correspond direct with the Duchess. Best wishes. Colin

Good morning, Liz - I left a message at your home this morning that your Dad would like to speak with you when you have a chance to call. Rosie p.s. - P. L. and I did early voting the first Saturday available!!  It was such a good feeling as Tuesdays are tough with trying to get to the office and leave in time to vote!! Elizabeth Lay <lizard_ar@yahoo.com> on 11/06/2000 09:13:26 AM 
Dear Friends and Family, We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas. Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at 7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the supervisors are not required to keep the polls open after 7pm for those in line. Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or your local Democratic campaign office, they will have people available to transport people to the polls. Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity including inappropriate campaigning to the poll watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the Republicans will have representatives at most of the polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity. Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and offer your time to make phone calls to encourage people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to be available to help prevent of voter fraud. Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!! Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's from me and everyone else)! Take care and VOTE! Liz __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Thousands of Stores.  Millions of Products.  All in one Place. http://shopping.yahoo.com/

Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker ""I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail. ""The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no way reflect my own personal beliefs. ""My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious views from his professional conduct? ""I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong support to continue. ""The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability to perform their professional responsibilities. ""Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he is ""out of step with Portland"" could be used in other Oregon communities to fire more liberal public officials who are ""out of step"" with their community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both ways. ""Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than just walk away. ""He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff. He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so. ""He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

From Ken Lay - Ken said ""Get word back to Lucie that 6 or 7, but would prefer 6 and add an extra special 7th meeting during the year if it's needed"". Thanks. Rosalee ""Lucie Salhany"" <Lucie@jhmedia.com> on 11/10/2000 05:29:26 PM 
Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight (8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? ? I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be dropped most easily are June or  September.? ? June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new information is available. ? I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to ""fill the  house"" in June. ? On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings we currently have.? I will await your  reply. ? Regards, ? ?

Hi Mr. Lewis - Ken asked me to send you an e-mail stating that he would be happy to submit your name for consideration to Dick Cheney.  He asked if you would please send him a current bio. Thanks. Rosalee <Bill_Lewis@mckinsey.com> on 11/28/2000 03:43:58 PM 
Ken, Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until December 7. The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain. Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am carrying my computer).

Hi Mr. Ramsay - In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment and join the Ministerial dinner, with the Chair of the other Session in May, he said that he would be delighted to participate. We look forward to receiving additional information after the Governing Board has its meeting. 
Hi John - Ken said that given he will be in town on March 15, he will plan to attend the meeting also. By way of this e-mail, I'll check with Joe's office to see what time it's scheduled. Thanks. Rosie 
Ken and Joe Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank will be in Houston March 15 and would like to meet with Enron to see where there are opportunities for EXIM to work more closely with the company.  He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O""Boyle, head of the project finance group.  As you know we have done little with the Bank since Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by sanctions imposed against India.  Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank. I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and referred it to Joe.  I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is available. I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.

Ken wanted me to let you know that he has something in Austin the night before and wanted to find out what time the event in Cornell begins. Rosie Kevin Hannon@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 11/29/2000 08:51:27 AM 
Ken and Jeff, As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration. Kevin 
Kevin- Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all is well with you. Nov.2 email text We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and beyond. The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a ""live case study"" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28, 2001</underline>. You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace. We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank Rhodes, but these are still long shots. The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the date is March 28, 2001. The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it could become the basis for the March conference live case study presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and practices make this possible. I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around 1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way. Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As always, thanks for your great personal support. Dick 
Dear Kelly: I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enr= on=20 become involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in= =20 Houston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron=20 Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late= r=20 in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like= =20 NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're=20 targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars. =20 Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro= val=20 of an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX= O=018=20 title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20 information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not= =20 recognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut= ives. We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an= d=20 regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The ""Ask Why"" advertising= =20 campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in= =20 mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre= en.=20 Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and= =20 CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some= =20 are running in Europe as well. While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our= =20 future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are= =20 spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o= ur=20 business. Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming. Ken Kelly Merritt@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/03/2000 04:20 PM 
Mr. Lay, I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was= =20 this: The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and=20 received free air time of ""Enron"" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular= =20 as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron=20 sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors?= =20 Enron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel,=20 energy, and the most powerful being the victor? Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as= =20 AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race=20 would provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of ""The= =20 New Power Company"" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also giv= e=20 me someone to ""root"" for. Kelly Merritt Asset Mgr. - CALME/ENA 
We did receive this from David. David Haug@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/13/2000 02:14 PM 
Congratulations on making this not-unexpected move in a smooth, upbeat and= =20 highly positive way, with what looks like excellent timing and a clean=20 handoff.

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20 recommendation to appoint Jeff Skilling as chief executive officer, effecti= ve=20 at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will al= so=20 retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continu= e=20 as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the= =20 strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations. Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20 cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for= =20 the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I=01,m ready for = a=20 somewhat different role. Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a= nd=20 me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that=20 continues to exceed everyone=01,s expectations, including our own.  We look= =20 forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role. There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad= =20 shifts in strategy and direction. Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001. 
Jim: It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio= n,=20 this email includes the following: An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan= ds. Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h= ow=20 to remove those impediments. A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability= to=20 sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20 possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20 order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20 rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I= =20 have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose= d=20 amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable= =20 option. Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California. Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-= =20 and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20 office today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will als= o=20 identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed= =20 language. I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m= e=20 if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi= ng=20 else that I can do to assist you. Regards, Ken Lay Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes= =20 in Installing Small-scale Generation on Tribal Lands David Parquet, Vice-President Enron North America 101 California Street, Suite 1950 San Francisco, CA 94111 Phone: 415.782.7820 Fax: 415.782.7851 2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took= a=20 step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20 designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20 monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t= he=20 elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for= =20 California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc= e=20 the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20 offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o= f=20 distributed generation. =20 Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20 investor-owned and municipal utilities Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is = a=20 step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20 interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this= =20 requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20 generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when= =20 interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome= =20 through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20 possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th= e=20 utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20 accomplished through amendments to SB 27X. Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs= or=20 greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an= d=20 therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20 generation faces. =20 Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru= =20 D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant= =20 output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil= ities.=20 In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to= =20 face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20 interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects= . =20 These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X. 3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase= =20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20 Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward. Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our= =20 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20 California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  = As=20 such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat= es=20 adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases. Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power. Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20 We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues.  We have identified three options: Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.) Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix.  We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20 =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018) Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR= =20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through= =20 contract amendments. 4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001 Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20 Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports= =20 showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe= r=20 only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al= l=20 credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer= =20 of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20 likely. =20 CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20 summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20 estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,= well=20 below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio= n=20 in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power= =20 than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20 unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t= o=20 date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t= he=20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20 California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to = this=20 requirement. =20 Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early= =20 draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve= re=20 supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced= =20 number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20 utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren= t=20 pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be= =20 added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California= =01,s=20 Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil= l=20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing= =20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals. As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20 crisis must focus on four issues: Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. = =20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less= =20 than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer. The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi= slation=20 are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho= se=20 efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face= =20 in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20 requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s= =20 proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20 transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20 innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20 emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a= ir=20 districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20 required reductions in pollution emissions. Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright) Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing= =20 the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the= =20 best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo= st=20 effectively and quickly in two ways: Buy-down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun= d=20 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand= more=20 economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou= ld=20 be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,= =20 through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20 determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20 participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20 necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20 reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D= eal=20 Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort. Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements: An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price= =20 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment= =20 verification.

We further estimate= =20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time= s=20 that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20 directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20 control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from= =20 customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th= e=20 prohibition against Direct Access. Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a= =20 direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o= f=20 Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from= =20 customer migration. =20 In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when= =20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme= nt=20 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20 therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20 function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20 non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ= ia=20 should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period = in=20 which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments= =20 of utility load.

We plan to distribute the final draft by mid-March in time for you to take one last careful look before a conference call at the end of the month, and also for you to submit any supplementary views for inclusion. My suggestion is that views be kept to a few paragraphs, if possible. For those who wish to write one, you could disagree with part of the report, you could suggest a slightly different emphasis on some aspect of the report, or you could underline some aspect that you are especially enthusiastic about and believe deserves more attention. When we send the next draft to you I'll try to propose something about how we might release the report, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have about that. Here are two proposed dates for our next conference call. Please indicate your availability by preference (#1, #2). (#2) Wednesday, March 28, 5-6:30 PM (Eastern Standard Time) (#1) Thursday, March 29, 5-6:30 PM (Eastern Standard Time) Could you also send us the precise way that you would like your name and title to appear in the report?

Dear Mr. Lay, Enron's  dynamic growth in the field of energy during the last three years is truly remarkable. As a student of business, I am truly impressed by the strategic acquistions made by Enron in the area of power and its leveraged arbitrage with the gas industry.

Hi Rebecca - In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston. I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he sees your message. Rosie Rebecca McDonald@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/29/2000 11:51 AM 
Ken. I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate a meeting between you and Chevron. We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on additional ones. Clearly this is a bit of a ""cop out"".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't believe. If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to drink a pint for me. Regards Rebecca 
Hi Mr. Stelzer l- I don't believe Ken has had an opportunity to review the suggestions in your outline.  He has a huge stack of mail he hasn't gotten to yet.  Hopefully, by tomorrow, he will have seen it. Thanks. Rosalee Stelzer@aol.com on 03/15/2001 12:13:57 PM

Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible for co-ordinating Mr Lay's participation at the May IEA Ministerial session. From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled. I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.

Mr. Stelzer, Steve Kean is out of town until Wednesday, but in regard to your question about Rupert, Ken said that our people are already talking to Fox. He said he'll get back with you if we need a meeting with Rupert. Thanks. Rosalee Stelzer@aol.com on 03/15/2001 12:13:57 PM 
Will do -- and I assume I can go ahead with all of the suggestions in my outline. Right? Also, now that you are free of Blockbuster, should you and Rupert get together again?

Hello John, I hope you have returned to normal after the MC!!!  I can only say that it was a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked on the planning! Now to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and regatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy. However the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project, the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted $85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per person.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows for the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that sailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then leaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for $100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even. In the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than expected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by the end of next week. The most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00 or do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of course, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a cancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time? I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will be here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything finalized before she leaves. Give us your thoughts.

Pricing AIDS Medications to a 	Human Scale 
The Globalist/Stephan Richter <theglobalist@theglobalist.com> on 03/22/2001 12:11:56 PM 
Human Scale Dear Dr. Lay: New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com: RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the bottom they might feel the same. Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price of treatment to per-capita GDP. Best regards from Washington, Stephan Richter Publisher and Editor-in-Chief www.TheGlobalist.com ------------------------------------------------------- Also this week: JAPAN -- DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 55! During the course of its decade-long economic malaise, Japan has tried just about every trick in the book to get its economy growing again. We may have found the answer -- but be warned, those over the age of 55 may not like it! http://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-21-01.shtml CHINA'S CARIBBEAN ISLAND HIDEAWAY Why does China have an embassy on the tiny Caribbean island of St. Lucia -- an island 8,000 miles away from Beijing and with which it has few economic or political ties? http://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-19-01.shtml Coming Friday: A New Globalist Bookshelf Feature ROBERT KAPLAN ON THE TURKEY-ISRAEL AXIS Turkey is in the midst of an economic crisis -- and Israel's relations with the Palestinians have steadily deteriorated.

As a result oil prices pushed slightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at 25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl as a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as follows: Algeria - 32,000 Indonesia - 52,000 Iran - 146,000 Kuwait - 80,000 Libya - 54,000 Nigeria - 82,000 Qatar - 26,000 Saudi Arabia - 324,000 UAE - 88,000 Venezuela - 116,000 Total - 1,000,000 ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham, Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB (11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit Offshore area. Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum (co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km. Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.' For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum Bulletin. REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli, produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release. Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV, TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the company. AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of blocks offered by NOC in late 2000. *******SPECIAL FEATURES FOR 2001****** The MENA Petroleum Bulletin is to initiate rankings and league tables for the top suppliers to the oil and gas sector.

We thank Jack Clark, our general counsel, for his arduous pro-bono legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen. THANKS JACK!!! On another note, each of you should have received word from Rosemarie Foster, TFA's Administrative Assistant, regarding a Technology For All Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2001 at the University Hilton on the University of Houston Campus.  The meeting will take place at 2:00 PM and conclude by 3:30 PM.  It will take place in the context of an all-day Technology For All sponsored conference ""Digital Divide: A Call to Action"".  Each of you will receive an complimentary invitation to the activities of the day.  Ken Lay will be hosting a CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch, Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of courses utilized).

You should feel free however to focus your talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda soon.  Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?

Ken Lay said to let you know he does sign off on this draft. Rosalee ""Garten, Jeffrey"" <jeffrey.garten@yale.edu> on 04/09/2001 05:21:48 PM 
Hi Dr. Pershing - Will you please verify the dates again with me?  Is the 3:00 p.m. panel on Monday or Tuesday? Thanks. Rosalee ""PERSHING Jonathan, IEA/LTO"" <Jonathan.PERSHING@iea.org> on 04/24/2001 11:08:56 AM 
Dear Rosalee, I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable Development and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of two energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled ""Fuelling Sustainable Development"".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on hydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and Environment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency). The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des Sciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris. As I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the FORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers the following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of logistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information on any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the first energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but time does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion. I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can keep our files current. On our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday, and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background documents to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out if you had any ""last-minute"" questions which I might help answer. In addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris during our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also planning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is coming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in any events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know, we would be happy to make arrangements. Also, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we might facilitate their logistics. I look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Jonathan Pershing ________________________ Jonathan C. Pershing, PhD.

Sorry, Simone.  I don't believe we received it. 
The proposal is totally satisfactory to Ken Lay. Rosalee ""Holloway, Wanda"" <Wanda.Holloway@COMPAQ.com> on 04/19/2001 01:44:06 PM 
In light of Jesse Greene's acceptance of the SVP, Strategy position, we have re-examined his option opportunity for 2001.  As you recall, we deferred a decision on his option grant in December 2000 pending a decision on his status. Now that Jesse has accepted this new role, we are recommending a grant of 125,000 stock options, which is comparable to the December 2000 grant to other 16b officers in staff positions.  As a point of reference, below are the option grants made to 16b officers in December 2000: Blackmore - 375k Winkler - 350k Larson - 275k McDowell - 250k Elias - 150k Jackson - 175k Siekman - 155k Napier - 155k Fox - 125k Milton - 100k Clarke - 75k (received additional grant of 175k options upon appointment to CFO) Walker - 60k (received 250k new hire options in September) Robison - 0 (recently received new hire grant) If you have any questions or concerns about this proposal, please let Yvonne or I know.  If it is acceptable, please advise and we will provide a unanimous consent for your signature to formalize.  Thank you! Wanda G.

Well, I know this is terribly short notice, but Ken does have a meeting with Tom DeLay on Monday morning at 9:30 a.m.  (I know that's half a day gone for Joe if he's in town), but he is coming in to discuss RMIC (Republican Majority Issues Committee).  Are there specific things that Ken needs to be briefed on?  I know that Steve did recommend that Ken have this meeting. Thanks very much. 
Beau, Ken would like to do this if we can arrange it.  He has a video to receive the United Way Kneebone Award from Gerald Smith at 2:30 on Monday, May 7.  I'm thinking that maybe we could do this video at 2:00 p.m.  That is a lot to do two videos back to back, I guess, but there is very limited time available and I think the United Way one will be pretty easy.  Will 30 minutes be sufficient? Rosie ""Beau Herrold"" <beau@layfam.com> on 04/23/2001 03:37:57 PM Please respond to ""Beau Herrold"" <beau@layfam.com> 
Ken - ? Child Advocates'? 9th annual ""Pull for Kids  Sporting Classic"" is honoring? Harry  Reasoner.? Lannie Earthman, at Child Avdocates, told me that they  are putting together a short video (a tribute to Harry) for?the night of  the event.? Harry doesn't know about the video so it will be a  surprise to him that evening.? I've been told by Lannie that, at  Macey's request, those being videoed are Dr. Ralph Faigan (Baylor College of  Medicine), Steve Miller (CEO, Shell), Malcolm Gillis (President, Rice Univ.),  and hopefully you.? Baylor College of Medicine is filming and producing  it.? If you would agree to do it, they can film you at your office at your  convenience.? It probably wouldn't take very long, unless of  course?you had a whole lot to say about Harry.? They want to have it  finished in the next couple of weeks, because the event is only a month away  (May 19th). ? FYI, the Family Foundation?has always  supported the event and this year contributed $25,000 (the highest sponsor  level).? I don't think that you and Mom are planning on attending the event  or anyone else in the family. ? Let me know if you would be interested in this so  that I can help facilitate it. ? - Beau

Dear Ken, We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the White House probably has priority. Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th. the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller, Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

Good morning, Jean - I understand from Rob Bradley that you are putting together some facts for Ken as he is moderator of this panel tomorrow in Austin.  He said that he would like some bullet points about basic trend data last five years re: natural gas production and oil production in the State.  He also would like facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the subject. Thanks. 
All responses to this e-mail should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com Dear Colette: In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project. We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around this subject. If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Lay Chairman Enron Dear Dr Lay, When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the 2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious ""dream budget"" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business community. On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic industry activity and foreign investment. As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have would also be welcomed. I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail: mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org). For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in India again next December. Best regards, Colette Mathur, Director, Center for Regional Strategies World Economic Forum 
John, Ken said that he does support you extending the offer. Rosie 
Sherri, I'm sorry I have been sending your e-mails to the ""old"" name.  I didn't realize it had been changed, but this is so right and very good! 
Good morning, Mike.  What time is the meeting? Rosie 
Ken, Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 500 people. We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months. I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact. If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff. Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance. Mike 
All responses to Ken Lay should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com Roger: I appreciate the brief e-mail concerning The Continental article.  It turned out to be a nice article.

Mr. Pershing, I am still confused about the exact date of the panel!! Rosalee ""PERSHING Jonathan, IEA/LTO"" <Jonathan.PERSHING@iea.org> on 05/03/2001 08:00:41 AM 
Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted. I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants for use during the sessions. I look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Jonathan Pershing

Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) - I apologize for not responding.  The conference details have been a bit confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many.  Mr. Lay is scheduled to participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15.  He has to give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon.  It is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre.  Therefore, Dr. and Mrs. Lay will not be able to attend. Thank you. Rosalee Gabriella.GOEKJIAN@oecd.org on 05/10/2001 10:11:44 AM

Hi Sherri - Ken said that he will pledge $750.00 - $5 per mile.  Sally will pass on to Holly in the Foundation office to prepare a check to get to you. Rosie Sherri Sera 03/29/2000 11:13 AM 
Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS. Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge to this very worthy cause 1-1. I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me. Sherri x3-5984 
I think we've received everything Mr. Pershing.  We have the VIP pass for the car. Rosalee ""PERSHING Jonathan, IEA/LTO"" <Jonathan.PERSHING@iea.org> on 05/11/2001 12:55:08 PM 
I just wanted to follow up to make sure that all the arrangements for Mr Lay's trip to Paris are in order.  In particular, I wanted to make sure that the materials for the FORUM, including the VIP pass for his car and driver made it to you.  Please let me know if not, and I will arrange to have the materials left at his hotel pending his arrival. I have been in touch with Mr Bradley on input to Mr Lay's remarks, and all seems in order on that front. Thanks again for your help. Best, Jonathan Pershing 
Mr. Lay said that he would like for you to accept service on his behalf. Robert_Donohoo@i2.com on 05/09/2001 10:32:34 AM 
Gentlemen; You may or may not be aware, but each of you has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm. What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a shareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on behalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that all damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit. Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of ""tag-along"" type of action. The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit on your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you would like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common practice. I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter. Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your behalf. Thanks Bob Donohoo Corporate Counsel i2 Technologies, Inc.

Bush                    | >----------------------------------------------------------------------------| Dear Ken: Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in Washington a week or so ago, she said that the ""Digital Divide"" was the hottest topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so that businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity and platform in Washington! Just thought I should give you ""heads-up"" in case he asks and please tell Linda I said hello! Thank you for doing so much for the cause!

Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie - We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only window he has next week. Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.

Ken, Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the ""Enron Teaching Excellence Awards.""  It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you in person.  Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your interoffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is quite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as such?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with which to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have. As we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional ""brown bags"" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university. I believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image campaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you the date when I have it. Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on Sept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will have a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it will be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your calendar is free. I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your approachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all or even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are doing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you. Thank you for your time, Jeff 
Mr. Lay, My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the ""Cougars @ Enron"".  We are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our kickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and have received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you a line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of today, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to our group's success. We have several stated objectives: 1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships. This will benefit the employees as well as the company. 2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the University of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs. 3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university. 4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible. Currently, here is what we have planned: 4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at ""Frontier Fiesta"".   Frontier Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good family   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited. 9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first home football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up a   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The university will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest. These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages. We anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would like the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to its members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be one of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would you consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most distinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions that you may have as to how to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that it has great potential.  With you support, we can attain a level of success that will set us aside from any other group. Thank you for your time, Jeff 
Dick, I don't know if we answered this for you or not, but I'm sure it will be fine for you to draft a letter for Ken's signature. Rosie Richard Leibert@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/01/2000 09:10 AM 
Ken, Received communications from the Texas Department of Economic Development and the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce.

Sanjay - Further to my earlier message, Ken is very willing to go to the Chief Minister's hotel to meet with him. Rosie Sanjay Bhatnagar@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/19/2000 06:52 AM 
to Dr. Lay Dear Ken: As discussed I would appreciate your meeting with the CM even for a few minutes at Davos. I will find soem time in ur schedule to brief you for that meeting before you leave for Davos. The CM considers u as a personal friend now that u have arranged for him to be invited to Davos. In fact he has also requested you personally whether you can arrange a meeting with Bill Gates while he is there. That would probably be impossible given everyone's schedule there and my message for that to the CM is going to be that eaxctly that... the schedules look impossible to arrange that. However for your meeting, I would appreciate giving us some time. Regards, Sanjay

The process is competitive, but I would like to proceed with your nomination this coming winter if the 2001 date is available on your schedule.

Dear Ken, As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from 3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it. Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from 6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates: Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for you: ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm Many thanks, Jeff Garten

Hi Donna - Ken said that the letter is fine.  Do you want to send us a list of the past Fathers and let us send the letters? Let me know. Rosie ""Donna J. Bryant"" <djbryant@insync.net> on 06/19/2000 04:40:19 PM 
Ken, Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year. As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do. Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support. Donna - KLay2000request.doc

Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them. Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.

My=20 research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions = on=20 this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy= =20 schedule. =01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva= nces=20 being made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere= nce=20 will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20 chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil= l=20 be partitioned into five areas:=20 1) Information technology for risk management 2) Information technology for pricing and trading 3) Data techniques and strategies 4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management 5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced= =20 by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached= a=20 copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20 exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their= =20 products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management. This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com= e=20 to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation= =20 from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at= =20 hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let= =20 me know; any help would be gratefully received. This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20 Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th= e=20 leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated= =20 speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry. Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly= =20 appreciate an email soon to let me know if you would like to take  part in= =20 this event.

Hi Liz - The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their family. They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the Vittors have. Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths. They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m. I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, we won't be able to come.   Our ""first"" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!! Take care and call if we can do anything.

Hi Tim - Just to let you know that Mr. Lay has already pledged to Sandy Hoelscher for the MDA Beach Bowl. Thanks. Rosalee Timmy Ng@ECT 07/06/2000 09:52 AM 
Hello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year. I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event. Checks are payable to MDA. FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! Have a great day! Tim Ng x30998

Dear Mr. Lay: My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate for Texas Rep. 147. I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal. I was on the winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side this year. I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new arena that is not needed. Sincerely, James Partsch-Galvan Libertarian Candidate for Texas Rep. 147 http://www.galvan.org 
Hi Mr. Grady - I did talk to Joe Hillings this morning, who is currently in Philadelphia, and he said that is great for you to attend.

Ken: Greetings from the GOP Convention.  I notice on my master schedule that Enron is hosting a cocktail party on Wednesday from 5 to 7.  I was wondering two things: 1.  Is it alright if I come by, as a member of the Advisory Committee?  And, 2.  Will I see you there? Hope all is well and that I will see you in Philadelphia.

Hi Rob - Ken said ""If you'll prepare the remarks, I'll be happy to do this"". Rosie Rob Bradley 07/19/2000 09:51 AM 
If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to become the employer of choice in the marketplace. You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman of the event. - Rob

Ken wanted me to let you know that he has something in Austin the night before and wanted to find out what time the event in Cornell begins. Rosie Kevin Hannon@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 11/29/2000 08:51:27 AM 
Ken and Jeff, As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration. Kevin 
Kevin- Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all is well with you. Nov.2 email text We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and beyond. The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a ""live case study"" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28, 2001</underline>. You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace. We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank Rhodes, but these are still long shots. The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the date is March 28, 2001. The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it could become the basis for the March conference live case study presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and practices make this possible. I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around 1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient way. Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As always, thanks for your great personal support. Dick 
Dear Kelly: I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enr= on=20 become involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in= =20 Houston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron=20 Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late= r=20 in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like= =20 NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're=20 targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars. =20 Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro= val=20 of an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX= O=018=20 title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20 information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not= =20 recognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut= ives. We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an= d=20 regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The ""Ask Why"" advertising= =20 campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in= =20 mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre= en.=20 Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and= =20 CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some= =20 are running in Europe as well. While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our= =20 future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are= =20 spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o= ur=20 business. Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming. Ken Kelly Merritt@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/03/2000 04:20 PM 
Mr. Lay, I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was= =20 this: The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and=20 received free air time of ""Enron"" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular= =20 as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron=20 sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors?= =20 Enron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel,=20 energy, and the most powerful being the victor? Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as= =20 AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race=20 would provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of ""The= =20 New Power Company"" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also giv= e=20 me someone to ""root"" for. Kelly Merritt Asset Mgr. - CALME/ENA

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability= to=20 sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20 possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20 order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20 rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.

Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California. Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-= =20 and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20 office today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will als= o=20 identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed= =20 language.

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took= a=20 step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20 designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20 monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t= he=20 elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for= =20 California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc= e=20 the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20 offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o= f=20 distributed generation. =20 Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20 investor-owned and municipal utilities Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is = a=20 step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20 interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this= =20 requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20 generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when= =20 interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome= =20 through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20 possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th= e=20 utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20 accomplished through amendments to SB 27X. Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs= or=20 greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an= d=20 therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20 generation faces. =20 Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru= =20 D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant= =20 output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil= ities.=20 In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to= =20 face local opposition.

Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase= =20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20 Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward. Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our= =20 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20 California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  = As=20 such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat= es=20 adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases. Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power. Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20 We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues.  We have identified three options: Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.) Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix.  We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20 =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018) Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR= =20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through= =20 contract amendments. 4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001 Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20 Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports= =20 showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe= r=20 only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al= l=20 credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer= =20 of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20 likely. =20 CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20 summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20 estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,= well=20 below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio= n=20 in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power= =20 than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20 unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t= o=20 date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t= he=20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20 California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to = this=20 requirement. =20 Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early= =20 draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve= re=20 supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced= =20 number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20 utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren= t=20 pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be= =20 added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest. CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of= =20 rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20 optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000= =20 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California= =20 should view the CEC's ""rosy scenario"" with considerable skepticism. 5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California= =01,s=20 Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil= l=20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing= =20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals. As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20 crisis must focus on four issues: Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. = =20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less= =20 than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer. The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi= slation=20 are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho= se=20 efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face= =20 in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20 requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s= =20 proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20 transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20 innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20 emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a= ir=20 districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20 required reductions in pollution emissions. Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright) Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing= =20 the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the= =20 best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo= st=20 effectively and quickly in two ways: Buy-down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun= d=20 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand= more=20 economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou= ld=20 be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,= =20 through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20 determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20 participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20 necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20 reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D= eal=20 Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort. Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements: An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price= =20 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment= =20 verification. Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be= =20 paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018). The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ= e: =01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti= cularly=20 in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation= =20 resources. reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20 electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity = in=20 the state. fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris= k=20 of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20 customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for= =20 responding.=20 We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in= =20 excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for= =20 summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate= =20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time= s=20 that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20 directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20 control systems that would support load curtailment implementation. Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi= cle:=20 SB27X The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we= re=20 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy= =20 service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from= =20 customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th= e=20 prohibition against Direct Access. Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a= =20 direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o= f=20 Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from= =20 customer migration. =20 In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when= =20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme= nt=20 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20 therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20 function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20 non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ= ia=20 should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period = in=20 which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments= =20 of utility load. Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative = vehicle:=20 AB18X Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand= . =20 In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20 imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers= =20 and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ= ia=20 State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend= ed=20 period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc= e=20 in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20 participate in that market. California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a= =20 series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20 increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without= =20 =01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c= ould=20 amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio= d. =20 In addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:= =20 First, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20 recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of = AB=20 1890.

Hi Barbara -  does Ken Lay need to be on these e-mails? Rosie 
Hi Jonathan - E-mail is great.  I have copied Tori Wells on this also, as she works diligently on Dr. Lay's itineraries and Rob Bradley, who works on Dr. Lay's speeches.  We have virtually no information about the OECD Forum or the IEA Ministerial session except dates - May 15-16.  We have made reservations for Dr. & Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel. We look forward to hearing from you. Rosalee ""PERSHING Jonathan, IEA/LTO"" <Jonathan.PERSHING@iea.org> on 03/19/2001 05:14:19 AM 
Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible for co-ordinating Mr Lay's participation at the May IEA Ministerial session. From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled. I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.  Please let me know whether e-mail or a telephone call would be best. I look forward to hearing from you. Jonathan Pershing _____________________ Jonathan C. Pershing, PhD.

Pricing AIDS Medications to a 	Human Scale 
The Globalist/Stephan Richter <theglobalist@theglobalist.com> on 03/22/2001 12:11:56 PM 
Human Scale Dear Dr. Lay: New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com: RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the bottom they might feel the same. Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price of treatment to per-capita GDP. Best regards from Washington, Stephan Richter Publisher and Editor-in-Chief www.TheGlobalist.com ------------------------------------------------------- Also this week: JAPAN -- DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 55! During the course of its decade-long economic malaise, Japan has tried just about every trick in the book to get its economy growing again. We may have found the answer -- but be warned, those over the age of 55 may not like it! http://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-21-01.shtml CHINA'S CARIBBEAN ISLAND HIDEAWAY Why does China have an embassy on the tiny Caribbean island of St. Lucia -- an island 8,000 miles away from Beijing and with which it has few economic or political ties? http://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-19-01.shtml Coming Friday: A New Globalist Bookshelf Feature ROBERT KAPLAN ON THE TURKEY-ISRAEL AXIS Turkey is in the midst of an economic crisis -- and Israel's relations with the Palestinians have steadily deteriorated. So what do these countries have to gain by forming a strategic alliance? __________________________________________________________________________ To unsubscribe from this service, click here: http://www.tafnet.com/TAFmailer/uns.asp?Unsub=klay@enron.com [Tracking ID:985284327|6188]

This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit Offshore area. Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum (co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km. Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.' For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum Bulletin. REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli, produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release. Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV, TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the company. AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of blocks offered by NOC in late 2000. *******SPECIAL FEATURES FOR 2001****** The MENA Petroleum Bulletin is to initiate rankings and league tables for the top suppliers to the oil and gas sector.

Hi Mr. Reed - I left a message on Thursday evening for Rosemarie, but was out Friday, so was too busy to follow up today, but having said all that, Ken Lay wanted me to let you know that he would like to have the TFA board meeting at the Enron building.  Please let me know if that will be possible. Rosalee ""Will Reed"" <will.reed@techforall.org> on 04/02/2001 01:33:14 PM Please respond to <will.reed@techforall.org> 
Gentlemen, Technology For All (TFA)received today our 501(c)(3) exemption letter from the IRS.  This letter gives us the opportunity to vigorously pursue new funding opportunities and also validates what we have known all along. TFA is a charitable organization serving the underserved in communities across the US. We thank Jack Clark, our general counsel, for his arduous pro-bono legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen. THANKS JACK!!! On another note, each of you should have received word from Rosemarie Foster, TFA's Administrative Assistant, regarding a Technology For All Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2001 at the University Hilton on the University of Houston Campus.  The meeting will take place at 2:00 PM and conclude by 3:30 PM.  It will take place in the context of an all-day Technology For All sponsored conference ""Digital Divide: A Call to Action"".  Each of you will receive an complimentary invitation to the activities of the day.  Ken Lay will be hosting a CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch, Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of courses utilized). Regards, Will --------------------------- Technology For All

Ken Lay said to let you know he does sign off on this draft. Rosalee ""Garten, Jeffrey"" <jeffrey.garten@yale.edu> on 04/09/2001 05:21:48 PM 
Hi Dr. Pershing - Will you please verify the dates again with me?  Is the 3:00 p.m. panel on Monday or Tuesday? Thanks. Rosalee ""PERSHING Jonathan, IEA/LTO"" <Jonathan.PERSHING@iea.org> on 04/24/2001 11:08:56 AM 
Dear Rosalee, I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable Development and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of two energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled ""Fuelling Sustainable Development"".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on hydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and Environment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency). The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des Sciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris. As I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the FORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers the following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of logistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information on any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the first energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but time does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion. I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can keep our files current. On our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday, and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background documents to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out if you had any ""last-minute"" questions which I might help answer. In addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris during our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also planning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is coming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in any events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know, we would be happy to make arrangements. Also, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we might facilitate their logistics. I look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Jonathan Pershing ________________________ Jonathan C. Pershing, PhD.

The proposal is totally satisfactory to Ken Lay. Rosalee ""Holloway, Wanda"" <Wanda.Holloway@COMPAQ.com> on 04/19/2001 01:44:06 PM 
In light of Jesse Greene's acceptance of the SVP, Strategy position, we have re-examined his option opportunity for 2001.  As you recall, we deferred a decision on his option grant in December 2000 pending a decision on his status. Now that Jesse has accepted this new role, we are recommending a grant of 125,000 stock options, which is comparable to the December 2000 grant to other 16b officers in staff positions.  As a point of reference, below are the option grants made to 16b officers in December 2000: Blackmore - 375k Winkler - 350k Larson - 275k McDowell - 250k Elias - 150k Jackson - 175k Siekman - 155k Napier - 155k Fox - 125k Milton - 100k Clarke - 75k (received additional grant of 175k options upon appointment to CFO) Walker - 60k (received 250k new hire options in September) Robison - 0 (recently received new hire grant) If you have any questions or concerns about this proposal, please let Yvonne or I know.  If it is acceptable, please advise and we will provide a unanimous consent for your signature to formalize.  Thank you! Wanda G.

Beau, Ken would like to do this if we can arrange it.  He has a video to receive the United Way Kneebone Award from Gerald Smith at 2:30 on Monday, May 7.  I'm thinking that maybe we could do this video at 2:00 p.m.  That is a lot to do two videos back to back, I guess, but there is very limited time available and I think the United Way one will be pretty easy.  Will 30 minutes be sufficient? Rosie ""Beau Herrold"" <beau@layfam.com> on 04/23/2001 03:37:57 PM Please respond to ""Beau Herrold"" <beau@layfam.com> 
Ken - ? Child Advocates'? 9th annual ""Pull for Kids  Sporting Classic"" is honoring? Harry  Reasoner.? Lannie Earthman, at Child Avdocates, told me that they  are putting together a short video (a tribute to Harry) for?the night of  the event.? Harry doesn't know about the video so it will be a  surprise to him that evening.? I've been told by Lannie that, at  Macey's request, those being videoed are Dr. Ralph Faigan (Baylor College of  Medicine), Steve Miller (CEO, Shell), Malcolm Gillis (President, Rice Univ.),  and hopefully you.? Baylor College of Medicine is filming and producing  it.? If you would agree to do it, they can film you at your office at your  convenience.? It probably wouldn't take very long, unless of  course?you had a whole lot to say about Harry.? They want to have it  finished in the next couple of weeks, because the event is only a month away  (May 19th). ? FYI, the Family Foundation?has always  supported the event and this year contributed $25,000 (the highest sponsor  level).? I don't think that you and Mom are planning on attending the event  or anyone else in the family. ? Let me know if you would be interested in this so  that I can help facilitate it. ? - Beau

May I suggest that we invite some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller, Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts. As always, Mary Hope ************************************** Mary Hope Katsouros Senior Vice President The H.

Good morning, Jean - I understand from Rob Bradley that you are putting together some facts for Ken as he is moderator of this panel tomorrow in Austin.  He said that he would like some bullet points about basic trend data last five years re: natural gas production and oil production in the State.  He also would like facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the subject. Thanks. 
All responses to this e-mail should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com Dear Colette: In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project. We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around this subject. If there's any way we can be of help, let me know. Best regards, Ken Lay ""Colette Mathur, Director"" <indiasummit@weforum.org> on 04/24/2001 09:44:29 AM 
To the attention of: Dr Kenneth L. Lay Chairman Enron Dear Dr Lay, When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the 2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious ""dream budget"" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business community. On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic industry activity and foreign investment. As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have would also be welcomed. I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail: mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org). For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in India again next December. Best regards, Colette Mathur, Director, Center for Regional Strategies World Economic Forum 
John, Ken said that he does support you extending the offer. Rosie 
Good morning, Mike.  What time is the meeting? Rosie 
Ken, Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 500 people. We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months. I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact. If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff. Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance. Mike 
All responses to Ken Lay should be sent to kenneth.lay@enron.com Roger: I appreciate the brief e-mail concerning The Continental article.  It turned out to be a nice article.

Mr. Pershing, I am still confused about the exact date of the panel!! Rosalee ""PERSHING Jonathan, IEA/LTO"" <Jonathan.PERSHING@iea.org> on 05/03/2001 08:00:41 AM 
Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted. I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants for use during the sessions. I look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Jonathan Pershing 
Hi Mr. Pfeffer - Dr. Lay asked me to tell you it's fine to proceed ahead with the 2001 date. It looks available on his schedule.  Please let me know if you need information from us. Rosalee ""Walter L. Pfeffer"" <mizzouwally@compuserve.com>@compuserve.com> on 05/26/2000 11:04:25 AM 
Dear Dr. Lay, In my last note, I believe I promised to check on the dates for the Faculty-Alumni Awards ceremonies in the future.  The University and the MU Alumni Association have them scheduled for: October 26, 2001, October 4, 2002, and October 10, 2003. As I mentioned, the nominations are due February 1st of each year, and attendance at the awards ceremony is necessary in order to receive it.  The process is competitive, but I would like to proceed with your nomination this coming winter if the 2001 date is available on your schedule. I visited with Mr. Purdy yesterday about a project at the Evans Scholars House.  He and Mrs. Purdy seem to be doing fine - and enjoying the spring sunshine! I look forward to visiting with you again.  Until then, I am Cordially yours, Wally Pfeffer Past-President, Leaders College of Arts & Science p.s.  hope you have a relaxing holiday weekend!

Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) - I apologize for not responding.  The conference details have been a bit confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many.  Mr. Lay is scheduled to participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15.  He has to give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon.  It is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre.  Therefore, Dr. and Mrs. Lay will not be able to attend. Thank you. Rosalee Gabriella.GOEKJIAN@oecd.org on 05/10/2001 10:11:44 AM

I just wanted to follow up to make sure that all the arrangements for Mr Lay's trip to Paris are in order.  In particular, I wanted to make sure that the materials for the FORUM, including the VIP pass for his car and driver made it to you.  Please let me know if not, and I will arrange to have the materials left at his hotel pending his arrival. I have been in touch with Mr Bradley on input to Mr Lay's remarks, and all seems in order on that front. Thanks again for your help. Best, Jonathan Pershing 
Mr. Lay said that he would like for you to accept service on his behalf. Robert_Donohoo@i2.com on 05/09/2001 10:32:34 AM 
Gentlemen; You may or may not be aware, but each of you has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm. What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a shareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on behalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that all damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit. Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of ""tag-along"" type of action. The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit on your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you would like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common practice. I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter. Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your behalf. Thanks Bob Donohoo Corporate Counsel i2 Technologies, Inc.

Dear Ken, As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from 3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it. Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from 6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates: Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for you: ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm Many thanks, Jeff Garten

Dear Rosalee: As far as we know, Kenneth Lay is planning to take a private jet to participate in Aspen ISIB's Business Leaders Dialogue taking place in Aspen, Colorado, July 27 - 30th. He will be a little late - arriving July 28th. In addition, it is our understanding that he will not require sleeping accommodations at the Aspen Meadows for the period of the Dialogue. If any aspect of this information is incorrect or if there have been any changes in his itinerary or required accommodations, please let us know immediately. Kind Regards, and Many Thanks for your help and patience in this process. Kind Regards, Godwin Carmona Program Coordinator Aspen ISIB 
As we discussed, the date that Ken thinks is best for the United Way Kick-off is August 9 at the conclusion of the Employee Meeting.  He thinks it would be fine to do the presentations there and then move on to whatever activity is planned. Thanks for everyone's patience.

Hi Donna - Ken said that the letter is fine.  Do you want to send us a list of the past Fathers and let us send the letters? Let me know. Rosie ""Donna J. Bryant"" <djbryant@insync.net> on 06/19/2000 04:40:19 PM 
Ken, Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year. As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do. Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support. Donna - KLay2000request.doc

Executive Committee Weekly Meeting 
On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing. MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC represents the frontier of computing technology. I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour. Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 or please reply by e-mail to me. 
Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them. Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling. 
Kenneth Lay has approved the attached expense report for Jeff Skilling.

Dear Rosalie/Dorothy: Tomorrow, we are sending to all participants via Airbourne, reading materials for the Business Leaders Dialogue in Aspen, Colorado (July 27-30).

The streams wil= l=20 be partitioned into five areas:=20 1) Information technology for risk management 2) Information technology for pricing and trading 3) Data techniques and strategies 4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management 5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced= =20 by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached= a=20 copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20 exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their= =20 products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

Dear Kenneth, Hello! I wanted to inform you of an exclusive Delphi Event.  Attached is a letter from Tom Koulopoulos, The Delphi Group's CEO, explaining the details for our upcoming Executive Retreat to be held on August 28-29 in Aspen.

This event is limited attendance since the St. Regis Aspen can only accommodate 200. The early registration fee is $2500.00 per seat. I will follow up with you later in the week. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please e-mail or call me at 617-247-1511.

Hi Mrs. Vittor - Your Dad just asked if you had sent an e-mail where you are staying in Miami. 
Hi Tim - Just to let you know that Mr. Lay has already pledged to Sandy Hoelscher for the MDA Beach Bowl. Thanks. Rosalee Timmy Ng@ECT 07/06/2000 09:52 AM 
Hello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year. I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event. Checks are payable to MDA. FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! Have a great day! Tim Ng x30998

Dear Mr. Lay: My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate for Texas Rep. 147. I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal. I was on the winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side this year. I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new arena that is not needed. Sincerely, James Partsch-Galvan Libertarian Candidate for Texas Rep. 147 http://www.galvan.org 
Hi Mr. Grady - I did talk to Joe Hillings this morning, who is currently in Philadelphia, and he said that is great for you to attend.

Ken: Greetings from the GOP Convention.  I notice on my master schedule that Enron is hosting a cocktail party on Wednesday from 5 to 7.  I was wondering two things: 1.  Is it alright if I come by, as a member of the Advisory Committee?  And, 2.  Will I see you there? Hope all is well and that I will see you in Philadelphia.

Hi Rob - Ken said ""If you'll prepare the remarks, I'll be happy to do this"". Rosie Rob Bradley 07/19/2000 09:51 AM 
If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to become the employer of choice in the marketplace. You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman of the event. - Rob 
Oh, Rob, I'm happy to do so!!  I hope you are on vacation!! Rosie Rob Bradley 08/04/2000 01:27 PM 
Great--and I will be inspired with my draft of his remarks. Rosie, could you call the phone number on the invitation, ask for Herb Bateman (he is the director), and tell him of the commitment? I am out of town and do not have their number, and they called me wondering about Ken's decision last Friday. Thanks, - Rob Kenneth Lay on 08/04/2000 12:40:45 PM Sent by: Rosalee Fleming

Also, there is a small possibility that the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's meeting with President Clinton; they are still working on the final agenda. Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, and will keep you posted of any changes; best regards,  jaime____

Hi Kenny: Bonny sent me your E-mail address and so I am trying it out. Sorry we could not make it to the party. The temperature is very warm here in Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently and it looks like it is doing fine. I am particularly interested in your venture into the fiber optics communications business and the windpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular business last year and I think the land line company will be sold soon. We sold to Allied Telephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other engineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together about 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system from East to West across Kansas. That was sold with the Cellular.

Dear Ken: Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this event. Our theme is ""2001: An Energy Odyssey."" We are using the conference to showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to clearly define these major themes and priorities than you. I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t= o heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in markets on behalf of enterprises. The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an= d university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo= u up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc= e (at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas. Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project, which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel= p identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary session, ""Sustaining Development"" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn thinking around with our re-phrasing). I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We look forward to having you with us next April!

The next World Economic Forum will be held September 11-13 in Melbourne.  I have received information from the Control Risks Group that several anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale clashes between demonstrators and police are expected. If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel accomodations.  Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents if you desire. Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be rescheduled. Regards, Mike Hicks 
Hi Mr. Moore - I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation until September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for several weeks, it is already pretty booked up. I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. Lay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by e-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Cindy Olson,  would be available to meet with you on August 28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department. Please advise. Rosalee ""Charles Moore"" <CHMoore1@email.msn.com> on 08/21/2000 04:14:08 PM 
I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving. ? I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name just a few. ? I look forward to hearing from you. ? ? P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.
