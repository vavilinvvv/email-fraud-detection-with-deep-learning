Attached is the CERA report entitled ""Drilling Activity Downturn Means Tighter Gas Supply"". A short synopsis: FALLING GAS PRICES TRIGGER ACTIVE RIG COUNT DECLINE The economic downturn, lower industrial demand, moderate weather, and falling gas prices have combined to hit gas-directed drilling activity hard. Gas prices briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068 gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers' drilling plans for the 2002 budget year are already being curtailed. *  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day of lost production. *  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive capacity. *  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it.

Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/ NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week. For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience.

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market. NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis market. ""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is scheduled for completion in June of 2002. NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the area. ""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season will determine the final scope of the project. ""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of interest,"" said Macdonald.

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100

Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which is in dire need of new power generation. The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer 2003. Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process recently enacted by the California legislature. Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition, construction management and operation of global power production facilities. The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
Distributed Power: The Next Big Investment? With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters. With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the ""next big investment opportunity for the coming decade."" In Winters' 250 page report, ""Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: Set for a Revolution-Part 2,"" he examines technologies and companies within the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage of the current situation. ""Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in the early 1980's,"" said Winters. ""Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of high quality, reliable power,"" added Winters. According to his research, microturbines are the best positioned of the ""new"" technologies that would be able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, efficient and very versatile. ""They can be used as a main power source, a back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in traditional energy prices,"" the analyst said. ""Microturbines can also be used in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access to electricity."" Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other fuels as well. In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering flywheel technology, as a ""buy"" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading manufacturer of microturbines, as ""attractive."" The companies are in addition to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- 
CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing A special session yesterday of California's regulators gave PG&E's utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb. 7 when the current federal DOE emergency order expires, but it postponed action on another PG&E request that Southern California Gas Co. --- which has strongly objected --- be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PG&E utility's residential and small business customers. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said PG&E's utility is a ""victim --- a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers,"" now demanding payment for future supplies up front --- not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its credit-worthiness. The CPUC action allows PG&E's utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PG&E's gas utility operations while the credit-worthiness of the company itself is dubious. It won't be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation, according to PG&E gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig. On the operational side, PG&E on Wednesday declared a low-inventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system. The action was thought to help cause the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point, Homrig said. Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. ""These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh,"" Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. ""Suppliers who have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these

The action was thought to help cause the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point, Homrig said. Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. ""These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh,"" Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. ""Suppliers who have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these 
Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100

Market - CERA Alert 
Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001 Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power producers-may have been lulled to sleep. Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a hold on their fuel costs. However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are raring to get what they believe they deserve. One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com. 
Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/ NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week. For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience.

Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term. FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would ""no longer make available to the public"" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to ""respond timely to legitimate requests"" for such documents. The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution.

Executive News: PNM terminates merger with Western Resources Albuquerque, N.M.-based PNM Resources announced Tuesday its board had officially killed the proposed deal to buy Western Resources' electric utility subsidiaries. The deal, originally valued at over $4 billion, had been in trouble for months, and each side sued the other in state court in New York. PNM said the merger could be terminated after Dec. 31 under the terms of the deal, if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards completing the transaction. But Western has disputed that PNM had grounds to back out of the deal. PNM sued Western in October seeking to get out of the deal alleging breach of contract, in part because of adverse rulings from the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) on rates and a Western restructuring plan considered vital to the transaction. Western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later, seeking at least $650 million in damages against PNM for alleged extortion, breach of contract, sabotage and improper interference in the KCC proceedings. Neither case has been decided, although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Western's case or delay action on it until after it has decided PNM's initial suit. Western also has appealed the KCC order blocking a planned restructuring in preparation for the PNM transaction to a Kansas district court.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : October 29, 2001 ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009).

Kenosha Exp, Gulf South's Gulf Pines, CIG's Western Frontier 
Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. ""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
FERC Approves North Baja Pipe The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
California Markets Named Westpath Expansion 
Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
Gas Storage and Transportation System 
TEXAS JOURNAL Energy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is Missing By Jonathan Weil Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 09/20/2000 The Wall Street Journal Texas Journal T1 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings. Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions. ""There could be a quality-of-earnings issue,"" says Tom Linsmeier, an associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. ""There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in 
Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100

PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran Dame of combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film career and notoriety seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold statuettes. Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the real-life drama, ""Erin Brockovich,"" taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's familiar logo in the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs in association with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier this month, a new real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates getting into the southern part of its California gas transmission system. The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother of three young children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged operating mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually in the local water supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is about 130 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on the development of tumors and other health problems among many of the Hinkley residents. By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater containing chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of the chromium eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it ""did not respond to (that) problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have."" It provided drinking water to nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to have them. PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. In 1996, however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 Hinkley residents for a record $333 million. ""The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked it,"" said Jon Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, ""It's clear in retrospect that our company should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish 
Drew, a relative of yours? CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact report for the state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the Sacramento Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding landowners, Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage project operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the approval process for environmental review. Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project in Texas and it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in the Bakersfield area, according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of Sacramento should come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this summer and be operational before the end of the year. ""We see the environmental report as the 'light at the end of the tunnel',"" Fossum said. Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) identifying the project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then was circulated to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before the final report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were held by the CPUC last October. Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative law judge for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period before the project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, a CPUC spokesperson said. ""We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already have our compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and that can go pretty quickly,"" Fossum said. ""In the best of all worlds it would be this year; in the worst case,

Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's regulators and Indicated Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three transportation agreements by which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of unsubscribed firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of Transwestern Pipeline and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation capacity to the southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest today. Between the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm capacity from the San Juan and Permian basins to California. For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity represents a worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and Trade, who has held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. ""At least then there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now it's Enron, the 
CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing A special session yesterday of California's regulators gave PG&E's utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb. 7 when the current federal DOE emergency order expires, but it postponed action on another PG&E request that Southern California Gas Co. --- which has strongly objected --- be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PG&E utility's residential and small business customers. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said PG&E's utility is a ""victim --- a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers,"" now demanding payment for future supplies up front --- not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its credit-worthiness. The CPUC action allows PG&E's utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PG&E's gas utility operations while the credit-worthiness of the company itself is dubious. It won't be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation, according to PG&E gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig. On the operational side, PG&E on Wednesday declared a low-inventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system. The action was thought to help cause the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point, Homrig said. Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. ""These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh,"" Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. ""Suppliers who have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these 
Senate Calls for Hearing into High Gas Prices There appears to be one issue that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill can agree on --- gas prices are too high. Chairman Frank H. Murkowski (R-AK) of the Senate Energy Committee and Ranking Minority Member Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) have called for an oversight hearing to look into rising natural gas prices. The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 12 in Senate Dirksen 366. Appearing before the committee will be representatives of the gas industry and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. ""Spot prices for natural gas on Dec. 6 hit $9.54/MMBtu. That compares to a price a year ago of about $2.16/Btu,"" said Murkowski. ""We are concerned about 
Guardian Pipeline said it bought five engine compressor packages totaling 22,225 hp to provide natural gas compression on its 141-mile, 660 MMcf/d pipeline in Illinois and Wisconsin. It purchased the compressors from Compressor Systems, Inc. of Midland, TX. Combined, the compressors will be capable of delivering up to 750 MMcf/d of gas on Guardian. ""Guardian Pipeline is continuing to make steady progress. This purchase agreement for a major equipment component keeps Guardian on track to meet its scheduled in-service date of November 2002,"" said George Hass, Guardian project manager. A final Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision on the Guardian Pipeline is expected by early 2001. In June, FERC issued a Preliminary Determination that the pipeline is in the public interest, subject to the outcome of its environmental review, and in July, FERC staff issued a favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the project. In addition, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin made a preliminary dete rmination on the project in October, accepting the economics of a Wisconsin Gas lateral pipeline, which will connect Guardian with Wisconsin Gas' distribution system. Guardian will transport gas from interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern, and NGPL at the Chicago hub near Joliet, IL, to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets starting in November 2002. Its sponsors include CMS, WICOR and Viking Gas. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Anonymous Letters Put UtiliCorp in Hot Water Investigations in several states are getting under way into alleged illegal profit-taking by UtiliCorp United in Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa. An anonymous letter from someone who claimed to be a current employee for UtiliCorp was sent to state regulators alleging the company's Gas Supply Service Department (GSS) took part in improper actions in reselling natural gas to customers in these states. ""Personnel are paid bonuses based on the value that can be extracted from managing the assets paid for by the Missouri Public Service (MPS) ratepayers,"" the letter said. The anonymous author said that value is extracted in numerous ways that are undetectable to staff audit efforts. One method included in the letter was for UtiliCorp employees to sell a first of the month ""put"" to suppliers, invoicing the put premium on a separate invoice that would never be included in audited documentation. If prices drop, the supplier puts first of the month gas to MPS. Another scheme alleged in the letter includes capacity releases. ""Operations personnel extract one-to-two cents per release by doing buy-sells with MPS capacity, instead of doing a posted release,"" said the letter. ""They look at the lowest credit amount possible to report, instead of maximizing the capacity release credit."" The anonymous author speculated that these actions are taken to reach the unit's lofty profit goal of $10 million. ""Due to the emphasis on earnings, GSS's top priority is earnings, not providing efficient, reliable, economic gas supplies,"" the author concluded. Jerry Cosley, a UtiliCorp United spokesperson said, ""We can say without qualification, that in no way would we approve of any improper behavior or 
Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to markets in New Jersey and New York. Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered by the original certificate. The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The $80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines currently are running full. 
Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge new rival for Western Canadian supply. ""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that

Drew, a relative of yours? CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact report for the state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the Sacramento Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding landowners, Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage project operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the approval process for environmental review. Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project in Texas and it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in the Bakersfield area, according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of Sacramento should come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this summer and be operational before the end of the year. ""We see the environmental report as the 'light at the end of the tunnel',"" Fossum said. Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) identifying the project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then was circulated to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before the final report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were held by the CPUC last October. Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative law judge for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period before the project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, a CPUC spokesperson said. ""We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already have our compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and that can go pretty quickly,"" Fossum said.

PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran Dame of combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film career and notoriety seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold statuettes. Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the real-life drama, ""Erin Brockovich,"" taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's familiar logo in the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs in association with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier this month, a new real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates getting into the southern part of its California gas transmission system. The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother of three young children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged operating mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually in the local water supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is about 130 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on the development of tumors and other health problems among many of the Hinkley residents. By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater containing chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of the chromium eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it ""did not respond to (that) problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have."" It provided drinking water to nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to have them. PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. In 1996, however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 Hinkley residents for a record $333 million. ""The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked it,"" said Jon Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, ""It's clear in retrospect that our company should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border.

TEXAS JOURNAL Energy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is Missing By Jonathan Weil Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 09/20/2000 The Wall Street Journal Texas Journal T1 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings. Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions. ""There could be a quality-of-earnings issue,"" says Tom Linsmeier, an associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. ""There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in

The result has been a steady and= =20 steep decline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 into the $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t= he=20 mid- $5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua= l=20 fuel oil in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20 inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade= quate supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to= a=20 quick return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap. Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe= r=20 20 accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif= t=20 in market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima= tely=20 3.8 Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and = 58=20 Bcf above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob= er=20 22. With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20 expected next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o= n October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table= =20 1). Is this inventory level ""enough""? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter= =20 under 15- year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf= =20 above the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20 withdrawals in the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo= ve=20 last year=01,s withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac= e=20 of a return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul= d bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20 winter, holding withdrawals down requires both of the following: * Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down. These markets represent approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return, should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol. * The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas. In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,= =20 particularly as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20 demand can be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c= an=20 be held reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar= ch=20 1996 and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag= e=20 of $3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was= =20 nearly 4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa= s=20 lower, and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20 customers in the United States. Market fundamentals in CERA=01,s view still support gas prices above those = of=20 resid, which as of this writing is pricing in the $4.75-$5.00 per MMBtu range. War= m weather throughout November and into December could reverse this=20 relationship, but a warm October alone is insufficient, and any cold weather within the next = few weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the=20 market. CERA=01,s price outlook for November--an average of $5.50 at the Henry Hub-= - stands for now. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated table. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at= =20 http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

I assume you already know this...... Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan, P.C. Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Azurix Corp. MONDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2000 5:27:00 PM EST PHILADELPHIA, Oct 26, 2000 AZX (""Azurix"" or the ""Company"") at artificially inflated prices during the period June 9, 1999 through August 8, 2000 and traceable to Azurix's Initial Public Offering (""Class Period"") and who were damaged thereby. If you are a member of the proposed Class, you should contact this firm at the telephone number or address below. If you wish to be appointed lead plaintiff in this action you must file a motion with the Court no later December 12, 2000. Class members must meet certain legal requirements to serve as a lead plaintiff. If you purchased Azurix common stock during the Class Period or have questions or information regarding this action or your rights, you may call or write Barbara A. Podell, Adam Savett or Renee C. Nixon, of Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan. P.C. at 800/993-3233 or via e-mail at sfprpc@op.net. The complaint charges Azurix and certain of its senior officers and directors with violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint also charges Enron Corp. as a controlling person under Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants disseminated to the investing public false and misleading financial statements and press releases concerning the Company's publicly reported financial condition and future prospects. The complaint further alleges that defendants issued to the public on or about June 9, 1999, in connection with the Company's initial public offering, a false and misleading registration statement and prospectus. These documents touted the Company's primary business strategy - acquiring, owning, operating and managing large privatization w ater supply and wastewater projects. However, through a series of partial disclosures beginning on March 30, 2000 and ending on August 8, 2000, it was revealed that several large privatization projects were already postponed or canceled at or near the time of the IPO. As a result of defendants' misrepresentations the price of Azurix common stock was artificially inflated throughout the Class Period. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Azurix common stock during the Class Period. The plaintiff is represented by Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan, P.C. which has extensive experience representing shareholders in class actions and has successfully recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for defrauded investors and shareholders. The reputation and expertise of the firm in shareholder and other class action litigation has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have appointed the firm to major positions in complex class action litigations.

Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market, free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker yesterday, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers 
El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major player. The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the non-fee-based side. As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Note:  There will be a briefing meeting on the project in Denver on Nov. 14 N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with direct access to several local distribution companies, including Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, NGPL, Northern and Vector. The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering ""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value. Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14.

PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 levels. The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit charge. ""We're just keeping our legal options open,"" said a San Francsco-based utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders. Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9 billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's 
Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time (400-500 MMBtu/d hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to commission the Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through. Some predictors are saying the delay may get longer. Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. ""Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has been removed from the line,"" says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. ""However, periodic reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago."" A spokesman said the debris included ""bits of foam"" that came off equipment used to extract moisture following hydrostatic testing. The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the operation together around the clock 365 days a year. ""It's a tremendously complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A consent agreement has been filed with the FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP. El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would result in a $20 million loss. The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General. 
Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate Program, the company said. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. 
Note:  The following was sent out by CERA and has a short term forecast of prices and alternate fuel pricing.  Note the price differential forecasts by basin. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Wed, November 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111500_18/nag_alt_111500_18_ab.html ********************************************************* After a warm October, the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November, a heavy early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter. Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750 billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record low heading into the heating season, and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next, difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil, but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end users may be required. None of these measures comes easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time high for December. But even this estimate could prove low. If the current cold snap extends through early December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00 per MMBtu range. Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month, increasing the withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of the past two years. By the end of this month, the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to 350 Bcf. CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996 all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter, as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced out of the market. Demand-Keeping Warm After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter (November through March) was the warmest of the decade, and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season. Under normal weather conditions, * Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5 Bcf per day higher than last year's. * Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day in January. * December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per day relative to last December. Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day relative to normal weather. Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight, there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run, which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market. This winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 MMcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of 4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November, with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching. Supply-The Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the soaring gas-related rig count. * The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in 2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam play. * Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews. Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February, with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline. Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again, this time until December 1. Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf per day. During November that total should climb to 750 MMcf per day, despite the later published start date. With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast, differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA expects a December average differential of $0.25 per MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average $0.20 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per MMBtu for December. * Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15 per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices $0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at $5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000 MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's weather be colder than normal, we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000. These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized. Canadian Markets-Winter Begins The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East. Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf below the five-year average. Even with modest withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs. Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well above the five-year average. With the eastward movement of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin. This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada. The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal ""freeze-up,"" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year. Further Delays for Alliance? The ""commercial"" in-service date for Alliance has been delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line, delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant, the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up since September. It is estimated that flows for November will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year- over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern Canada. High Prices: Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a result of this increased pull. For December, the differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.10 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this message with associated Tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market. NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis market. ""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is scheduled for completion in June of 2002. NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the area. ""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season will determine the final scope of the project. ""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the Houston audience. ""In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry,"" he said, pointing to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things upside down. When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy companies are now adopting that method. In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy industry. ""We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom of this synopsis, the web site address  will direct you to the full report released today if you would like further information. EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from $2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's latest report. EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for about half the change in energy projections. EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. ""In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases

The following steps will be undertaken in the event ANR is experiencing flowing volumes at Marshfield less than 200 Mdth/d and, in ANR's good faith reasonable judgment, such shortfall will threaten the operational integrity of its pipe in Western Wisconsin.  Also, ANR first has to maximize flowing volumes of 86 Mdth/d at NNG-Janesville and 735 Mdth/d at Great Lakes -Crystal Falls. ANR will issue an OFO to the ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt capacity at Viking-Marshfield directing their shippers to schedule their gas on ANR at Marshfield. If any shipper does not comply with the OFO, ANR will notify Viking of the shipper, default volume, and upstream Viking shipper holding primary delivery pt capacity at Marshfield on Viking who is supposed to be supplying the gas. Viking will then notify the defaulting shipper on their system that they will only accept firm primary delivery pt nominations at Marshfield for the volume designated by ANR until ANR notifies Viking that the OFO condition has ended. If the Viking shipper does not comply by taking their gas to Marshfield as requested by Viking, Viking will permit ANR to act as shipper's agent and nominate for them. It was noted that ANR will not be a shipper on Viking or hold title to gas transported on Viking. This letter agreement resolves temporarily ANR's request for 33 Mdth/d of capacity on Viking they filed on June 19, 2000 in Docket CP00-391-000. Additional Notes: The ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt capacity at Marshfield are: Mich Con, UtiliCorp, Wisonsin Electric, Wisconsin Fuel & Light, and Wisconsin Public Service. The Viking shippers with firm primary delivery pt capacity at Marshfield are:  The same shippers as above as well as Engage Energy. 
PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran Dame of combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film career and notoriety seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold statuettes. Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the real-life drama, ""Erin Brockovich,"" taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's familiar logo in the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs in association with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier this month, a new real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates getting into the southern part of its California gas transmission system. The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother of three young children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged operating mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually in the local water supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is about 130 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on the development of tumors and other health problems among many of the Hinkley residents. By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater containing chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of the chromium eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it ""did not respond to (that) problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have."" It provided drinking water to nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to have them. PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. In 1996, however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 Hinkley residents for a record $333 million. ""The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked it,"" said Jon Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, ""It's clear in retrospect that our company should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish 
Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's regulators and Indicated Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three transportation agreements by which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of unsubscribed firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of Transwestern Pipeline and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation capacity to the southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest today. Between the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm capacity from the San Juan and Permian basins to California. For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity represents a worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and Trade, who has held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. ""At least then there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now it's Enron, the

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Thu, October 26, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Temporary Slack Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=3D5526&m=3D1402 , Alternative URL:=20 http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/102600_15/nag_alt_102600_15_ab.html ********************************************************* Warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the foc= us=20 in the gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growi= ng=20 sense that supplies might just prove adequate. The result has been a steady and= =20 steep decline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 into the $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t= he=20 mid- $5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua= l=20 fuel oil in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20 inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade= quate supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to= a=20 quick return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap. Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe= r=20 20 accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif= t=20 in market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima= tely=20 3.8 Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and = 58=20 Bcf above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob= er=20 22. With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20 expected next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o= n October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table= =20 1). Is this inventory level ""enough""? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter= =20 under 15- year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf= =20 above the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20 withdrawals in the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo= ve=20 last year=01,s withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac= e=20 of a return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul= d bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20 winter, holding withdrawals down requires both of the following: * Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down. These markets represent approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return, should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol. * The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas. In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,= =20 particularly as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20 demand can be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c= an=20 be held reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar= ch=20 1996 and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag= e=20 of $3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was= =20 nearly 4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa= s=20 lower, and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20 customers in the United States. Market fundamentals in CERA=01,s view still support gas prices above those = of=20 resid, which as of this writing is pricing in the $4.75-$5.00 per MMBtu range. War= m weather throughout November and into December could reverse this=20 relationship, but a warm October alone is insufficient, and any cold weather within the next = few weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the=20 market. CERA=01,s price outlook for November--an average of $5.50 at the Henry Hub-= - stands for now. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated table. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at= =20 http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

I assume you already know this...... Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan, P.C. Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Azurix Corp. MONDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2000 5:27:00 PM EST PHILADELPHIA, Oct 26, 2000 AZX (""Azurix"" or the ""Company"") at artificially inflated prices during the period June 9, 1999 through August 8, 2000 and traceable to Azurix's Initial Public Offering (""Class Period"") and who were damaged thereby. If you are a member of the proposed Class, you should contact this firm at the telephone number or address below. If you wish to be appointed lead plaintiff in this action you must file a motion with the Court no later December 12, 2000. Class members must meet certain legal requirements to serve as a lead plaintiff.

Nixon, of Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan. P.C. at 800/993-3233 or via e-mail at sfprpc@op.net. The complaint charges Azurix and certain of its senior officers and directors with violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"") and Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint also charges Enron Corp. as a controlling person under Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants disseminated to the investing public false and misleading financial statements and press releases concerning the Company's publicly reported financial condition and future prospects. The complaint further alleges that defendants issued to the public on or about June 9, 1999, in connection with the Company's initial public offering, a false and misleading registration statement and prospectus. These documents touted the Company's primary business strategy - acquiring, owning, operating and managing large privatization w ater supply and wastewater projects. However, through a series of partial disclosures beginning on March 30, 2000 and ending on August 8, 2000, it was revealed that several large privatization projects were already postponed or canceled at or near the time of the IPO. As a result of defendants' misrepresentations the price of Azurix common stock was artificially inflated throughout the Class Period. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Azurix common stock during the Class Period. The plaintiff is represented by Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan, P.C. which has extensive experience representing shareholders in class actions and has successfully recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for defrauded investors and shareholders.

El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major player. The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the non-fee-based side. As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Note:  There will be a briefing meeting on the project in Denver on Nov. 14 N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with direct access to several local distribution companies, including Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, NGPL, Northern and Vector. The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering ""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value. Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at (402) 398-7758 or James Hoff in Denver at (303) 575-6475, or see the 
PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 levels. The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit charge. ""We're just keeping our legal options open,"" said a San Francsco-based utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders. Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9 billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's 
Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time (400-500 MMBtu/d hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to commission the Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through. Some predictors are saying the delay may get longer. Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. ""Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has been removed from the line,"" says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. ""However, periodic reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago."" A spokesman said the debris included ""bits of foam"" that came off equipment used to extract moisture following hydrostatic testing. The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the operation together around the clock 365 days a year. ""It's a tremendously complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A consent agreement has been filed with the FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP. El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would result in a $20 million loss. The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General. 
Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate Program, the company said. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. 
Note:  The following was sent out by CERA and has a short term forecast of prices and alternate fuel pricing.  Note the price differential forecasts by basin. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Wed, November 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111500_18/nag_alt_111500_18_ab.html ********************************************************* After a warm October, the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November, a heavy early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter. Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750 billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record low heading into the heating season, and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next, difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil, but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end users may be required. None of these measures comes easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time high for December. But even this estimate could prove low. If the current cold snap extends through early December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00 per MMBtu range. Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month, increasing the withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of the past two years. By the end of this month, the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to 350 Bcf. CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996 all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter, as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced out of the market. Demand-Keeping Warm After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter (November through March) was the warmest of the decade, and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season. Under normal weather conditions, * Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5 Bcf per day higher than last year's. * Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day in January. * December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per day relative to last December. Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day relative to normal weather. Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight, there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run, which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market. This winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 MMcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of 4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November, with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching. Supply-The Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the soaring gas-related rig count. * The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in 2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam play. * Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews. Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February, with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline. Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again, this time until December 1. Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf per day. During November that total should climb to 750 MMcf per day, despite the later published start date. With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast, differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA expects a December average differential of $0.25 per MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average $0.20 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per MMBtu for December. * Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15 per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices $0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at $5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000 MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's weather be colder than normal, we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000. These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized. Canadian Markets-Winter Begins The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East. Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf below the five-year average. Even with modest withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs. Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well above the five-year average. With the eastward movement of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin. This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada. The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal ""freeze-up,"" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year. Further Delays for Alliance? The ""commercial"" in-service date for Alliance has been delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line, delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant, the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up since September. It is estimated that flows for November will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year- over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern Canada. High Prices: Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a result of this increased pull. For December, the differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.10 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this message with associated Tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market. NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis market. ""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is scheduled for completion in June of 2002. NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the area. ""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season will determine the final scope of the project. ""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of interest,"" said Macdonald.

Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the Houston audience. ""In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry,"" he said, pointing to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things upside down. When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy companies are now adopting that method. In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy industry. ""We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom of this synopsis, the web site address  will direct you to the full report released today if you would like further information. EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from $2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's latest report. EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for about half the change in energy projections. EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. ""In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases 
The FERC has issued an Order Accepting the Letter Agreement between Viking and ANR to settle the issue of OFO status at the Marshfield interconnect between the two pipes. The following is a quick synopsis: Settlement  is effective through March 31, 2001 only. The following steps will be undertaken in the event ANR is experiencing flowing volumes at Marshfield less than 200 Mdth/d and, in ANR's good faith reasonable judgment, such shortfall will threaten the operational integrity of its pipe in Western Wisconsin.  Also, ANR first has to maximize flowing volumes of 86 Mdth/d at NNG-Janesville and 735 Mdth/d at Great Lakes -Crystal Falls. ANR will issue an OFO to the ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt capacity at Viking-Marshfield directing their shippers to schedule their gas on ANR at Marshfield. If any shipper does not comply with the OFO, ANR will notify Viking of the shipper, default volume, and upstream Viking shipper holding primary delivery pt capacity at Marshfield on Viking who is supposed to be supplying the gas. Viking will then notify the defaulting shipper on their system that they will only accept firm primary delivery pt nominations at Marshfield for the volume designated by ANR until ANR notifies Viking that the OFO condition has ended. If the Viking shipper does not comply by taking their gas to Marshfield as requested by Viking, Viking will permit ANR to act as shipper's agent and nominate for them. It was noted that ANR will not be a shipper on Viking or hold title to gas transported on Viking. This letter agreement resolves temporarily ANR's request for 33 Mdth/d of capacity on Viking they filed on June 19, 2000 in Docket CP00-391-000. Additional Notes: The ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt capacity at Marshfield are: Mich Con, UtiliCorp, Wisonsin Electric, Wisconsin Fuel & Light, and Wisconsin Public Service. The Viking shippers with firm primary delivery pt capacity at Marshfield are:  The same shippers as above as well as Engage Energy. 
Senate Calls for Hearing into High Gas Prices There appears to be one issue that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill can agree on --- gas prices are too high. Chairman Frank H. Murkowski (R-AK) of the Senate Energy Committee and Ranking Minority Member Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) have called for an oversight hearing to look into rising natural gas prices. The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 12 in Senate Dirksen 366. Appearing before the committee will be representatives of the gas industry and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. ""Spot prices for natural gas on Dec. 6 hit $9.54/MMBtu. That compares to a price a year ago of about $2.16/Btu,"" said Murkowski. ""We are concerned about 
Guardian Pipeline said it bought five engine compressor packages totaling 22,225 hp to provide natural gas compression on its 141-mile, 660 MMcf/d pipeline in Illinois and Wisconsin. It purchased the compressors from Compressor Systems, Inc. of Midland, TX. Combined, the compressors will be capable of delivering up to 750 MMcf/d of gas on Guardian. ""Guardian Pipeline is continuing to make steady progress. This purchase agreement for a major equipment component keeps Guardian on track to meet its scheduled in-service date of November 2002,"" said George Hass, Guardian project manager. A final Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision on the Guardian Pipeline is expected by early 2001. In June, FERC issued a Preliminary Determination that the pipeline is in the public interest, subject to the outcome of its environmental review, and in July, FERC staff issued a favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the project. In addition, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin made a preliminary dete rmination on the project in October, accepting the economics of a Wisconsin Gas lateral pipeline, which will connect Guardian with Wisconsin Gas' distribution system. Guardian will transport gas from interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern, and NGPL at the Chicago hub near Joliet, IL, to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets starting in November 2002. Its sponsors include CMS, WICOR and Viking Gas. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Anonymous Letters Put UtiliCorp in Hot Water Investigations in several states are getting under way into alleged illegal profit-taking by UtiliCorp United in Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa. An anonymous letter from someone who claimed to be a current employee for UtiliCorp was sent to state regulators alleging the company's Gas Supply Service Department (GSS) took part in improper actions in reselling natural gas to customers in these states. ""Personnel are paid bonuses based on the value that can be extracted from managing the assets paid for by the Missouri Public Service (MPS) ratepayers,"" the letter said. The anonymous author said that value is extracted in numerous ways that are undetectable to staff audit efforts. One method included in the letter was for UtiliCorp employees to sell a first of the month ""put"" to suppliers, invoicing the put premium on a separate invoice that would never be included in audited documentation. If prices drop, the supplier puts first of the month gas to MPS. Another scheme alleged in the letter includes capacity releases. ""Operations personnel extract one-to-two cents per release by doing buy-sells with MPS capacity, instead of doing a posted release,"" said the letter. ""They look at the lowest credit amount possible to report, instead of maximizing the capacity release credit."" The anonymous author speculated that these actions are taken to reach the unit's lofty profit goal of $10 million. ""Due to the emphasis on earnings, GSS's top priority is earnings, not providing efficient, reliable, economic gas supplies,"" the author concluded. Jerry Cosley, a UtiliCorp United spokesperson said, ""We can say without qualification, that in no way would we approve of any improper behavior or 
Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to markets in New Jersey and New York. Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered by the original certificate. The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The $80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines currently are running full. 
Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge new rival for Western Canadian supply. ""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that

TEXAS JOURNAL Energy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is Missing By Jonathan Weil Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 09/20/2000 The Wall Street Journal Texas Journal T1 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings. Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions. ""There could be a quality-of-earnings issue,"" says Tom Linsmeier, an associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. ""There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in

Vector Pipeline has appointed Craig R. Fishbeck as president of Vector. Vector believes that Fishbeck's extensive industry experience and knowledge of Vector's market area position him well to lead the company through its December 2000 start-up and coming years of growth. The pipeline also believes Fishbeck's appointment strengthens Vector's role as a vital link between the Chicago Hub and Dawn, Ontario, to help meet the growing demand for natural gas in the U.S. Midwest, Eastern Canada and the U.S. Northeast. Fishbeck comes to Vector from CMS - Panhandle where he held the position of vice

Note the price differential forecasts by basin. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Wed, November 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111500_18/nag_alt_111500_18_ab.html ********************************************************* After a warm October, the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November, a heavy early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter. Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750 billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record low heading into the heating season, and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next, difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil, but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end users may be required. None of these measures comes easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time high for December. But even this estimate could prove low. If the current cold snap extends through early December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00 per MMBtu range. Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month, increasing the withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of the past two years. By the end of this month, the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to 350 Bcf. CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996 all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter, as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced out of the market. Demand-Keeping Warm After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter (November through March) was the warmest of the decade, and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season. Under normal weather conditions, * Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5 Bcf per day higher than last year's. * Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day in January. * December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per day relative to last December. Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day relative to normal weather. Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight, there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run, which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market. This winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 MMcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of 4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November, with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching. Supply-The Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the soaring gas-related rig count. * The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in 2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam play. * Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews. Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February, with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline. Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again, this time until December 1. Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf per day. During November that total should climb to 750 MMcf per day, despite the later published start date. With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast, differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA expects a December average differential of $0.25 per MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average $0.20 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per MMBtu for December. * Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15 per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices $0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at $5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000 MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's weather be colder than normal, we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000. These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized. Canadian Markets-Winter Begins The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East. Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf below the five-year average. Even with modest withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs. Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well above the five-year average. With the eastward movement of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin. This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada. The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal ""freeze-up,"" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year. Further Delays for Alliance? The ""commercial"" in-service date for Alliance has been delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line, delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant, the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up since September. It is estimated that flows for November will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year- over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern Canada. High Prices: Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a result of this increased pull. For December, the differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.10 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this message with associated Tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate Program, the company said. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. 
Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A consent agreement has been filed with the FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP. El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would result in a $20 million loss. The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General. 
Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time (400-500 MMBtu/d hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to commission the Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through. Some predictors are saying the delay may get longer. Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. ""Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has been removed from the line,"" says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. ""However, periodic reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago."" A spokesman said the debris included ""bits of foam"" that came off equipment used to extract moisture following hydrostatic testing. The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the operation together around the clock 365 days a year. ""It's a tremendously complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders. Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9 billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's

Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t= he=20 mid- $5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua= l=20 fuel oil in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20 inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade= quate supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to= a=20 quick return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap. Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe= r=20 20 accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif= t=20 in market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima= tely=20 3.8 Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and = 58=20 Bcf above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob= er=20 22. With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20 expected next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o= n October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table= =20 1). Is this inventory level ""enough""? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter= =20 under 15- year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf= =20 above the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20 withdrawals in the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo= ve=20 last year=01,s withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac= e=20 of a return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul= d bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20 winter, holding withdrawals down requires both of the following: * Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down. These markets represent approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return, should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol. * The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas. In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,= =20 particularly as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20 demand can be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c= an=20 be held reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar= ch=20 1996 and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag= e=20 of $3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was= =20 nearly 4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa= s=20 lower, and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20 customers in the United States.

Anonymous Letters Put UtiliCorp in Hot Water Investigations in several states are getting under way into alleged illegal profit-taking by UtiliCorp United in Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa. An anonymous letter from someone who claimed to be a current employee for UtiliCorp was sent to state regulators alleging the company's Gas Supply Service Department (GSS) took part in improper actions in reselling natural gas to customers in these states. ""Personnel are paid bonuses based on the value that can be extracted from managing the assets paid for by the Missouri Public Service (MPS) ratepayers,"" the letter said. The anonymous author said that value is extracted in numerous ways that are undetectable to staff audit efforts. One method included in the letter was for UtiliCorp employees to sell a first of the month ""put"" to suppliers, invoicing the put premium on a separate invoice that would never be included in audited documentation. If prices drop, the supplier puts first of the month gas to MPS. Another scheme alleged in the letter includes capacity releases. ""Operations personnel extract one-to-two cents per release by doing buy-sells with MPS capacity, instead of doing a posted release,"" said the letter. ""They look at the lowest credit amount possible to report, instead of maximizing the capacity release credit."" The anonymous author speculated that these actions are taken to reach the unit's lofty profit goal of $10 million.

Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge new rival for Western Canadian supply. ""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to markets in New Jersey and New York. Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered by the original certificate. The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The $80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines currently are running full. 
Guardian Pipeline said it bought five engine compressor packages totaling 22,225 hp to provide natural gas compression on its 141-mile, 660 MMcf/d pipeline in Illinois and Wisconsin. It purchased the compressors from Compressor Systems, Inc. of Midland, TX. Combined, the compressors will be capable of delivering up to 750 MMcf/d of gas on Guardian. ""Guardian Pipeline is continuing to make steady progress. This purchase agreement for a major equipment component keeps Guardian on track to meet its scheduled in-service date of November 2002,"" said George Hass, Guardian project manager. A final Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision on the Guardian Pipeline is expected by early 2001. In June, FERC issued a Preliminary Determination that the pipeline is in the public interest, subject to the outcome of its environmental review, and in July, FERC staff issued a favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the project. In addition, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin made a preliminary dete rmination on the project in October, accepting the economics of a Wisconsin Gas lateral pipeline, which will connect Guardian with Wisconsin Gas' distribution system. Guardian will transport gas from interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern, and NGPL at the Chicago hub near Joliet, IL, to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets starting in November 2002. Its sponsors include CMS, WICOR and Viking Gas. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Senate Calls for Hearing into High Gas Prices There appears to be one issue that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill can agree on --- gas prices are too high. Chairman Frank H. Murkowski (R-AK) of the Senate Energy Committee and Ranking Minority Member Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) have called for an oversight hearing to look into rising natural gas prices. The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 12 in Senate Dirksen 366. Appearing before the committee will be representatives of the gas industry and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. ""Spot prices for natural gas on Dec. 6 hit $9.54/MMBtu. That compares to a price a year ago of about $2.16/Btu,"" said Murkowski. ""We are concerned about 
CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing A special session yesterday of California's regulators gave PG&E's utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb. 7 when the current federal DOE emergency order expires, but it postponed action on another PG&E request that Southern California Gas Co. --- which has strongly objected --- be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PG&E utility's residential and small business customers. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said PG&E's utility is a ""victim --- a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers,"" now demanding payment for future supplies up front --- not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its credit-worthiness. The CPUC action allows PG&E's utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PG&E's gas utility operations while the credit-worthiness of the company itself is dubious. It won't be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation, according to PG&E gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig. On the operational side, PG&E on Wednesday declared a low-inventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system. The action was thought to help cause the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point, Homrig said. Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. ""These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh,"" Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. ""Suppliers who have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these

Drew, a relative of yours? CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact report for the state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the Sacramento Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding landowners, Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage project operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the approval process for environmental review. Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project in Texas and it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in the Bakersfield area, according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of Sacramento should come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this summer and be operational before the end of the year. ""We see the environmental report as the 'light at the end of the tunnel',"" Fossum said. Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) identifying the project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then was circulated to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before the final report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were held by the CPUC last October. Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative law judge for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period before the project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, a CPUC spokesperson said. ""We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already have our compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and that can go pretty quickly,"" Fossum said.

PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran Dame of combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film career and notoriety seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold statuettes. Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the real-life drama, ""Erin Brockovich,"" taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's familiar logo in the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs in association with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier this month, a new real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates getting into the southern part of its California gas transmission system. The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother of three young children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged operating mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually in the local water supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is about 130 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on the development of tumors and other health problems among many of the Hinkley residents. By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater containing chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of the chromium eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it ""did not respond to (that) problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have."" It provided drinking water to nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to have them. PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. In 1996, however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 Hinkley residents for a record $333 million. ""The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked it,"" said Jon Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, ""It's clear in retrospect that our company should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish 
Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's regulators and Indicated Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three transportation agreements by which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of unsubscribed firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of Transwestern Pipeline and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation capacity to the southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest today. Between the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm capacity from the San Juan and Permian basins to California. For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity represents a worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and Trade, who has held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. ""At least then there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now it's Enron, the

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity.""

TEXAS JOURNAL Energy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is Missing By Jonathan Weil Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 09/20/2000 The Wall Street Journal Texas Journal T1 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings. Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions. ""There could be a quality-of-earnings issue,"" says Tom Linsmeier, an associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. ""There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in 
State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project.

Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : October 29, 2001 ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009).

Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term. FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would ""no longer make available to the public"" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to ""respond timely to legitimate requests"" for such documents. The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
Monthly Briefing 
Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. ""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004.

For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience.

Northwest Natural In Talks With Enron Over Portland Utility=20 By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robin Sidel, Rebecca Smith and Nikhi= l Deogun 10/05/2001 The Wall Street Journal B2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)= =20 Enron Corp. is in advanced discussions to sell its Portland General Electri= c utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $1.8 billion in cash = and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give Enro= n a minority stake in Northwest, according to people familiar with the matt= er.=20 The discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points nee= d to be finalized, these people caution. The current environment could also= make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn'= t a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could b= e announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to ass= ume roughly $1 billion in debt.=20 Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment.  If a transaction is consu= mmated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agree= ment to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell= apart in part because of the California energy crisis.  A purchase of Port= land General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a ma= rket capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more t= han 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Was= h. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million cu= stomers in Oregon.  The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whos= e executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwe= st's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating office= r of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. = By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in= its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when price= s are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people fami= liar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is s= omewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transa= ction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in N= orthwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the t= ransaction with debt and equity offerings.  Shares of Northwest Natural wer= e trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York St= ock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10.  For E= nron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-yea= r ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break= into California's deregulating electricity market.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : November 13, 2001 Watson: Enron Upside 'Clearly Worth Doing the Deal' 
Executive News: PNM terminates merger with Western Resources Albuquerque, N.M.-based PNM Resources announced Tuesday its board had officially killed the proposed deal to buy Western Resources' electric utility subsidiaries. The deal, originally valued at over $4 billion, had been in trouble for months, and each side sued the other in state court in New York. PNM said the merger could be terminated after Dec. 31 under the terms of the deal, if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards completing the transaction. But Western has disputed that PNM had grounds to back out of the deal. PNM sued Western in October seeking to get out of the deal alleging breach of contract, in part because of adverse rulings from the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) on rates and a Western restructuring plan considered vital to the transaction. Western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later, seeking at least $650 million in damages against PNM for alleged extortion, breach of contract, sabotage and improper interference in the KCC proceedings. Neither case has been decided, although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Western's case or delay action on it until after it has decided PNM's initial suit. Western also has appealed the KCC order blocking a planned restructuring in preparation for the PNM transaction to a Kansas district court.

Expansion 
Note:  This quick expansion was the result of FERC's expedited permitting process.  Lorna PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company's ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. ""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group's West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN's mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN's 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. ""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said. 
Market - CERA Alert 
Interstates Not Welcome in SoCal Territory California's anti-bypass policy would remain firmly in place on Southern California Gas' system under a peaking service proposed by SoCal that was approved last week by a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) judge (see Daily GPI, June 4 <d20010604e.html>), according to the sponsor of a prospective pipeline. The peaking service was introduced to replace the controversial back-up residual load service (RLS) on the SoCal Gas system. The RLS has been challenged as an ""anti-bypass"" mechanism. ""We were hoping for something less punitive, something that would encourage interstate pipeline construction, but this is more punitive. This will prevent any further investment in infrastructure,"" said Chadd Jones, spokesperson for Questar, which has an oil pipeline conversion project ready to go at the border. Jones said Questar, which has already started to convert a 16-inch oil line to natural gas outside California's border, is hoping the full CPUC will take a closer look and make some changes to the judge's decision. Otherwise, the converted Southern Trails line will have to stop at the border due to lack of customers. If the new peaking service is approved as it stands, customers of an interstate line into the state, instead of paying the RLS charge for back-up service supplied by the utility, would pay the even more onerous peaking charge. The peaking charge, added onto the charges paid for space on the interstate, makes the choice of interstate transportation prohibitive. Jones said the Southern Trails line is fully subscribed from the Four Corners area to the border, but ""no one is willing to take service on the in-state portion of the line to Long Beach, for fear of having to pay peaking rates."" Customers have been interested, but the potential cost is prohibitive. ""It's the reason no interstate pipelines have been built into SoCal Gas' territory,"" Jones said. He noted that Pacific Gas & Electric has no back-up service charge. The only interstate to penetrate California's borders, Kern River Pipeline, delivers to Bakersfield, which is outside the SoCal Gas system. 
New Peaking Rate for SoCalGas Could Spur Bypass 
Note:  There are a lot of good names and organizations in this article, especially the Economic Development Councils.  Worth spending some time with them? Lorna Wednesday, February 7, 2001 Nevada Goes for the Gold By Dave Todd dtodd@ftenergy.com <mailto:dtodd@ftenergy.com> It's a reverse twist on America's economic history. One might even call it a case of Eastward Ho! For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part of the United States, entrepreneurs are talking about leaving, not moving into, the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east. Not much farther east, only over the mountains into neighboring states, but still in that direction, as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of California. And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from Nevada. Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes ""could be the genesis for industry departures from the state."" The impact on large industrial users, he warned, could ""provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn"" in California, which accounts for about 12% of the United States GDP. California's mass exodus Since the beginning of the year, Nevada's primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state. The bad news for California is that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or ""wannabes"" whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery. 
Third Western Canada Pipeline Expansion Proposed Where's that scorecard? It's never around when you need it. By our count there are now three new proposals on the Canadian side to upgrade service through southern British Columbia and into the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Westcoast Energy entered the Northwest expansion lists last week with an announcement of an open season to run through the end of May for more capacity on its Southern Mainline and Westcoast Alberta line to accommodate additional volumes from supply areas in British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. The supplies would be directed by Nov. 1, 2003 to ""growing market demand in the BC Lower Mainland and the U.S. Pacific Northwest."" Westcoast is looking to expand its Southern BC Mainline from Compressor Station 2 to the Huntingdon delivery area (Zone 4) by about 200 MMcf/d and its Westcoast Alberta line from Nova/Gordondale to ABC/Gordondale, westbound by about 100 MMcf/d. The Canadian pipeline said its latest proposal matches the timing of an expansion by Northwest Pipeline, which connects with Westcoast at the border at Sumas/Huntingdon. The mainline expansion ""provides a very cheap expansion going straight south to Sumas. It can be done very quickly and very cheaply because it will loop existing line,"" said spokesman Robert Foulkes.It will start at the northern end from the T-South junction of various gathering lines, including the line south from the hot Northwest Territories development area. It's also possible the pipeline will look at a later expansion north of Fort St. John to increase the flow from that area. The Gordondale expansion also will bring in additional volumes from Alberta. ""This is in response to very good exploration and production results. Our line has been operating almost full, consistently through the winter,"" Foulkes said. Westcoast's proposal came a week after BC Gas Utility Ltd., said it was pursuing a plan to expand its brand-new Southern Crossing Pipeline also to increase pipeline capacity in southern BC and into the U.S. Pacific Northwest at Huntingdon, BC, across the border from Sumas,WA (see Daily GPI, April 4 <d20010404g.html>). BC Gas' plan calls for a 161-mile long expansion pipeline, costing about C$460 million. Questioned, Foulkes said he did not consider the BC line a competitor for Westcoast's proposal, since Westcoast would be providing direct service from the north through a less expensive looped line. TransCanada PipeLine also has announced an expansion of its Nova Gas Transmission system and its BC System to its border connection at Kingsgate, B.C./Eastport, ID to match an expansion of PG&E GT Northwest (see Daily GPI, Feb. 26 <d20010226k.html>, March 26 <d20010326j.html>). Following an open season, TransCanada said it would expand its Alberta system by 227 MMcf/d and its BC system by 216 MMcf/d. 
CIG Dusts Off Ruby Pipeline, Plans Extension to Sacramento, CA El Paso subsidiary Colorado Interstate Gas is dusting off its Ruby Pipeline project in light of the scramble to increase deliveries to the California market. The project, which originally was announced in 1998 to serve northern Nevada, will be extended to Reno, NV, and into California, the pipeline said in an open season announcement. 
Northwest 
California to Get Yet Another Pipeline Expansion The frenzied pace of pipeline expansion in the West clearly is not over yet. PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) is planning another major expansion, potentially 500 MMcf/d, with a targeted in-service date of November 2003. The pipeline company said it is starting an open season today to accommodate the large number of shippers who requested service in its last market test for additional capacity. In December and January, the company held an open season for a 200 MMcf/d expansion and received requests for more than 2.1 Bcf/d. ""Based on the response to the open season we conducted earlier this year and the power plant construction that continues both along side and downstream of our system, we believe there is still an unmet need for new pipeline capacity in the states served by GTN,"" said Peter G. Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes the GTN system. In January, GTN offered 200 MDth/d of firm transportation capacity for service in 2002. Two power generators, Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine, were awarded the space.  Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. Calpine also announced its own major pipeline to California last week with partner Kinder Morgan. The 2002 expansion will bring the total capacity of the 612-mile GTN system to 2,900 MDth/day at its Kingsgate, BC, receipt point. NEG is requesting expedited approval of that expansion so that partial service can begin as early as next winter, with full service available by summer 2002. Lund said the size of this major expansion will depend on the customer response in the open season, but GTN anticipates adding 300 MMcf/d to 500 MMcf/d. GTN's upstream gas transportation partner, TransCanada PipeLines, also is planning an expansion to accommodate the GTN additions. But besides GTN there are at least six other major pipeline expansions planned to serve California. Kern River has several expansions in the works. Colorado Interstate Gas is now planning to extend its proposed Ruby Pipeline across northern Nevada all the way to Sacramento. Questar has its Southern Trails pipeline to Long Beach under construction and has plans to expand its existing system and add a new storage field. El Paso is planning a variety of projects to increase deliveries to California and enhance gas transfers within the state using the All America Pipeline it purchased last year. Transwestern has an emergency expansion on file with FERC to add 150,000 Dth/d by June 2002, but could propose a much larger expansion in the near future because it received requests for 1.3 Bcf/d of additional capacity in an open season last fall. And Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans last week to build a 1,160-mile pipeline to deliver 1.75-2.25 Bcf/d of gas to San Francisco by summer 2003. 
Questar Plans WY Storage Project, Pipeline Hub Questar Pipeline launched a major pipeline expansion initiative Tuesday in conjunction with plans announced recently to move forward with the eastern portion of its Southern Trails Pipeline to California and in response to strong demand for capacity on several other downstream pipelines, particularly Kern River. Questar also said it is moving forward with plans to build the Rocky Mountain region's first high deliverability salt cavern storage operation, and will attempt to turn its existing pipeline system into a market hub. The company is holding three open seasons, including one for the southwest Wyoming storage project, another for a northern pipeline expansion and a third for a southern mainline expansion. ""We're moving forward with plans to make Questar Pipeline a major trading hub,"" said Questar President Keith O. Rattie during a conference call on the company's strong first quarter financial results. ""Our system already has many of the attributes of a major hub: abundant supply, multiple pipeline interconnections and abundant storage. We're moving ahead with plans to provide parking and loaning, no-notice balancing, wheeling and exchange, etc., which together will increase liquidity and facilitate trading and transportation on and between Questar and the other Rockies export pipes."" In addition, the company is expecting to add large amounts of receipt and delivery capacity at multiple points along its system. An expansion of its northern system would provide additional deliveries to LDC affiliate Questar Gas at Wasatch Front (up to 180,000 Dth/d is expected), Kern River at Muddy Creek or Painter (potentially 110,000 Dth/d), Northwest Pipeline at South Lake (30,000 Dth/d), and Wyoming Interstate Company, Overthrust Pipeline, Colorado Interstate Gas Company and Williams Central (50,000 Dth/d deliveries and up to 200,000 Dth/d of receipts at Wamsutter). The exact size of the project will be determined after the open season, which closes May 18. The southern system expansion will provide additional capacity from northern and southern receipt points to Kern River (ML104) at Elberta (potentially 300,000-400,000 Dth/d), TransColorado at Greasewood (40,000-60,000 Dth/d), Northwest Pipeline at Red Wash (80,000 Dth/d) and Questar Gas at the Wasatch Front. The transportation charges are as follows: reservation charge is $5.28804/Dth/month, the usage charge is $0.00267/Dth, the 100% load factor rate is $0.17652/Dth, the ACA charge is $0.00219/Dth and the fuel reimbursement charge is 0.8 %. Both projects are expected to be in service by Nov. 1, 2002. ""There are a lot of customers that have signed up for capacity on other pipelines that are interested in getting gas supplies to those pipelines,"" said Alan Allred, vice president of business development for Questar Pipeline. ""There also are a lot of producers who are developing new supplies and are interested in getting their supplies moved. Questar Pipeline is fortunate to sit right in the middle of the Rockies in this producing area with growing production and also to be interconnected to most of the major pipelines in the West. We've seen open seasons on Kern River, Northwest Pipeline and CIG for its new pipeline (Ruby) going to California. All of that has prompted a lot of interest in moving gas across our system. ""With the current [high] prices for gas and [strong] demand for gas, I think every available drilling rig we know of in the various basins is producing,"" he added. ""Certainly the Powder River [Basin] is producing a lot. We have the Emory coal-seam in Utah that's producing a lot of gas. There's drilling going on all around our pipeline: the Jonah area, the Mesa-Pinedale areas. And on the other end, there's a lot of demand in California."" He also noted there are multiple gas-fired power plants being constructed around Denver and in Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and in California, all of which could be served by Questar's pipeline and its new high-deliverability storage project. 
Capacity 
CIG Plans New Line From Rockies to Midcontinent Colorado Interstate Gas has announced an open season running through July 20 for a new pipeline to transport Rocky Mountain gas from the Cheyenne Hub to connections in the Midcontinent area near Greensburg, KS. 
PG&E GT-NW Plans Lateral Across Washington State PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) said it received market requests for about three times the capacity on a proposed lateral that would cross Washington and compete with Northwest Pipeline for rapidly expanding power generation markets in the western half of the state along the I-5 highway corridor. GTN closed its open season for the Washington Lateral Project June 22. It was the third open season for a GTN pipeline expansion this year. Meanwhile Northwest Pipeline has four expansions of its own planned for the region. ""The level of customer interest we received demonstrates the increasing demand for gas in Washington State,"" said Peter Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes GTN. Lund said GTN envisions a pipeline capable of transporting 300,000 to 400,000 Dth/d of gas. GTN said it received expressions of interest from local distributors and power generators. 
Williams Completes 2001 Kern River Expansion Ahead of Schedule SALT LAKE CITY -- A unit of Williams (NYSE: WMB) completed construction of expansion facilities on its Kern River natural gas transmission system on July 1. Williams filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on March 15 for a certificate of approval to proceed with the expansion project, adding 135,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service from Wyoming to California.

Plans 
Kinder Morgan Rolls: Snags Pipeline, Doubles 2Q Earnings There's good news and then there's better news. For Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI), every day just seems to be a front-page top-of-the-fold story. Take Wednesday, for instance. Delivering on projections made earlier this month that it would meet or beat consensus earnings estimates, KMI reported great news, with a 107% boost in second quarter earnings over the same period a year ago, and year-to-date earnings up 42%. However, KMI's general limited partner Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P. (KMP) almost trumped the broadcast, with its announcement that it would buy a 2,600-mile Texas natural gas pipeline system for $360 million and split its stock two for one. 
Pipe Expansions Planned for Rockies Region With several pipeline companies well into addressing the pipeline capacity shortages that persist as natural gas production grows throughout the Rocky Mountain region, Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission LLC (KMIGT) announced two major projects Wednesday, and several other companies detailed expansions planned or in the works during the closing session at the 13th Annual Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Strategy Conference. Headlining the news was KMIGT's plans to use existing rights-of-way to build the Advantage Pipeline, which would fill the same needs as the Colorado Interstate Gas pipe, moving from the Cheyenne Hub to the Mid-Continent. An open season is scheduled on the proposed pipe this fall. Dave Scharf, business development director for KMIGT, said the 24-inch pipe, which would move gas primarily from the Powder River Basin, would have a capacity of 330 MMcf/d, delivering to interconnects on its way to the Kansas City markets. ""It would have a smaller size, with about 40% less content,"" Scharf said, but it would be expandable to 450 MMcf/d, with access to liquid Mid-Continent pipes, local distribution centers and end-use markets. A smaller pipeline, NECO -- a 12-inch pipe, about 95 miles long -- would serve the northeastern Colorado market. Although small, Scharf emphasized that it would reduce some of the bottlenecks now evident in moving gas in that part of the state, and would also allow backhauls to Cheyenne. An open season on this line is also scheduled this fall, Scharf said. KMIGT also is planning to expand its storage capacity in the Rockies, adding more horsepower at the Cheyenne Hub and Huntsman facility. The Huntsman would be expanded to deliver 75 MMcf/d, with delivery at Cheyenne of 45 MMcf/d. ""We want to customize shippers' needs,"" Scharf said of the expansion. Noting there were synergies between the three projects, he said KMIGT was on a growth plan that would use both acquisitions and expansion. ""Rocky Mountain growth opportunities we see are in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska,"" he said. El Paso's Craig Coombs, who directs project development for the company's Western Pipeline Group, said El Paso also is expanding its pipelines east from the Rockies, with a Cheyenne to Mid-Continent connection, spending $380 million to add 540 MDth/d. The open season for this expansion ended July 20, said Coombs, and he said El Paso is now negotiating with shippers. A FERC filing is scheduled for December 2001, with an in-service date in late 2003 or early 2004. Coombs also updated attendees on the CIG expansion along the Front Range of the Rockies, which he said is on track to be in service by mid-2004. Over the next four years, Coombs said supply from the Rockies would grow from 5 Bcf/d to 7.5 Bcf/d, and warned there would be ""blood on the streets"" if pipeline systems are not expanded. Coombs said El Paso planned to file its request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January 2002 for its Ruby pipeline, which is scheduled to carry 250 MDth/d from the Rockies into Nevada and 500 MDth/d into California. The Ruby project, said Coombs, ""is designed with power plants in mind."" The pipeline will be 30-36-inches with 40,000 horsepower. El Paso's Western Frontier pipeline project, which also closed its open season in July, is also is on schedule, with a FERC filing by the fourth quarter of this year and an in-service target date by November 2003. ""What's driving all of these expansions are the power plant projects,"" Coombs said. With more than 9,200 MW proposed in the region in the coming years, he said capacity would rise more than 2 Bcf/d by 2010. Noting that every planned expansion might not come to fruition because of competing proposals, Coombs said that there is ""still tremendous growth"" in the Rockies. Shelley Wright, supervisor of capacity marketing for Questar Pipeline Co., detailed the many projects her company has under way in the Rockies, including its Main Line 104, the Clay Basin Projects, the Southern Trails pipe to California and its work on the Eakin compressors. The Main Line 104, a joint venture with El Paso's CIG, will move new and existing gas supplies to the Wasatch Front and other connecting pipes. It is expected to be in service in November 2001, and is on schedule and moving forward, Wright said. She also noted that the Clay Basin, which is the largest storage facility in the western United States, was already ahead of schedule for 2001-2002 storage. ""We're seeing more interest in getting storage filled this year"" than last, Wright said, noting that storage was depleted last winter. The Clay Basin facility will undergo testing tentatively in April 2002, which ""may result in additional firm capacity."" Wright said there had been ""a lot of interest in additional storage capacity,"" and Questar will know more next year as to whether it will expand the facility. 
El Paso Capacity Split Affiliates of El Paso Energy, Enron, Duke Energy and Pacific Gas & Electric appear to have picked up the largest shares of the 1.2 Bcf/d of available space on El Paso Natural Gas lines to Southern California points in the latest capacity auction. The assignments posted on the El Paso EBB from 30 companies mostly run for five or six years from the June 1, 2001 start date, with a few extending even longer. An El Paso spokesperson would not confirm the posted bids represented the final allocation, but industry sources said they did not expect the current holder of the 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity, El Paso Merchant Energy, whose contract runs out May 31, to exercise its right of first refusal. El Paso spokespersons have been promising an announcement for two days. It appears the winning bidders were taking no chances in going for the long term, since El Paso had said its economic evaluation of the bids would include returns up to five years. Rates paid were not disclosed, but sources were assuming, given current demand for capacity, they were at or near the maximum. The bids posted totaled 1,243,072 MMBtu/d and the leaders were (all volumes in MMBtu/d): El Paso Merchant Energy with 276,932, Enron Energy Services 254,056, Duke Energy affiliates 211,697, PG&E affiliates 151,300, Texaco Natural Gas 58,407, and Dynegy affiliates 56,418. For El Paso Merchant Energy, Enron, Duke and PG&E, the bulk of their capacity is for deliveries to PG&E at Topock. Other prospective capacity holders include MGI Supply Ltd., CEG Energy Options, Sempra Energy affiliates, Occidental Energy, Merrill Lynch Capital, Coral Energy, Mexicana del Cobre, AEP Energy Services, Allegheny Energy Supply, Williams Energy, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Burlington Resources, Paramount Petroleum, California Steel Industries, and others. Coming in the wake of the capacity squeeze going into California over the last year, the latest allocation was a far cry from the two previous auctions for about a third of El Paso's capacity relinquished by Pacific Gas & Electric in December 1997. Dynegy (then NGC) paid $70 million for the space for 1998 and 1999. The payment included about a 12-cent/Dth reservation charge, plus about 1.6-cent usage charge (see Daily GPI, Jan. 7, 1998 <d980107c.htm>). After that a contract with Enron for the space fell through and El Paso Merchant Energy picked up the capacity in January 2000 for 15 months for $38.5 million (see Daily GPI, Feb. 17, 2000 <d20000217e.html>). Management of the space has been under attack by California regulators and shippers since the first contract was awarded to NGC. El Paso and high-flying California border prices currently are among the targets of several investigations on-going in California and Washington. The company recently issued a press release labeling as ""demonstrably untrue"" allegations that capacity was manipulated to increase prices (see Daily GPI, Feb. 26 <d20010226g.html>). 
Decision Brief 
Note:  Let me know if you want the certificate filing on this.  Lorna Williams Files Evergreen Expansion Project SALT LAKE CITY -- A unit of Williams (NYSE: WMB) announced today that it has filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct and operate the Evergreen Expansion Project in the state of Washington. The proposed $240 million project is designed to expand Williams' existing Northwest Pipeline system from Sumas to Chehalis, Wash., (Sumas-Chehalis Corridor) to meet the demands of new electric generation facilities and to provide additional capacity in the Plymouth to Washougal, Wash., corridor (Columbia River Gorge Corridor) for existing firm shippers. The Evergreen Expansion Project will add 67,000 additional horsepower at five compressor stations and four sections of new pipeline loops, totaling 28 miles, in the Sumas-Chehalis Corridor. The new pipeline segments will generally be placed in existing right of way, parallel to Northwest's natural gas transmission system. To increase north flow capacity for existing firm shippers, 24,000 additional horsepower will also be installed at five compressor stations located within the Columbia River Gorge Corridor. 
State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
California Markets Named Westpath Expansion 
Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
FERC Approves North Baja Pipe The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
El Paso Merchant Declines ROFR Opportunity El Paso Merchant Energy, declining to match bids for about one-third of the capacity on its affiliate El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline into California, ""passed up a short-term profit"" (and more controversy) to focus on ""building our long-term relationship with our California customers,"" according to spokesman Mel Scott. The Merchant Energy arm of El Paso, did, however, pick up 270 MMcf/d or 22% of the 1.22 Bcf/d awarded to 30 bidders earlier this week (see Daily GPI, Feb. 28 <d20010228f.html>). It was the largest slice, but not much above awards to three other large capacity winners. 
Fall - CERA Monthly Briefing

Projected 
Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers.

Producers Indicate North Slope's Beaufort Route May Get Nod In what would be a major blow to Alaska officials, especially Gov. Tony Knowles who has pinned the remainder of his term toward getting an Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline, major producers indicated this week that because the cost would be less, they now favor a North Slope pipeline that would move north, through the Beaufort Sea, instead of across the state. Ken Konrad, a BP executive, testifying during two days of hearings before the Alaska legislature's Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines, told the committee that an analysis ""so far indicates that the northern route appears more cost efficient than a southern route."" Konrad also noted that with a Beaufort line, gas reserves in the Mackenzie River delta also could be taken -- which would be a major victory for Canadian officials. Konrad and other stakeholders, including producers, analysts and government officials involved in moving gas from the North Slope, were asked to speak before the joint committee and offer their insight on where the project could be headed.  BP and partners Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum, the majority property rights' holders on the North Slope, have been analyzing various routes for a proposed pipe since last fall, which basically would either move supply across the state or go north under the Beaufort Sea and into Canada on a trek toward the Lower 48. The producer consortium, the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group, is spending close to $100 million to evaluate the routes and has indicated it could file an application on one of the routes with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by the end of this year. Konrad's testimony, as well as comments made during the hearings, indicate that the desire of Alaska officials to keep the pipe inside the state may fall apart. What appears to be the deal maker or breaker is cost. Konrad said only ""a few dimes"" separate the two major proposals, but transportation costs per thousand Btus would pick up savings in lower investment costs with a shorter pipe and lower operating costs. Economists have estimated the rate for bringing gas to the Lower 48 from the North Slope will be around $2.25/MMBtu. A shorter pipe overall would lead to substantial savings, especially on a project that Konrad noted faces serious challenges economically. Joe Maruschack, Phillips' natural gas pipeline chief, said his group is aware of the ""deep reservations"" Alaskan officials have about a Beaufort route, but also indicated that problems associated with the Beaufort route could be risky as well. He cited environmental opposition from aboriginal groups, which would have to approve the routing, construction on a sea route, logistical challenges and additional permitting as part of a daunting, and lengthy task. If the consortium and other producers chose the Beaufort route, Maruschack indicated that they could explore some way to bring gas to Alaska's residents south of the North Slope. But in Alaska, it's about more than the supply. This past spring the Alaska legislature, with strong support from Knowles, passed a law to prevent construction of a Beaufort route (see Daily GPI, March 30 <d20010330d.html>). Without Alaska's support, the Beaufort route could also face defeat.

Alaska Producers Say Gas Pipeline Would Be Too Expensive A natural gas pipeline to the Lower 48 states from Alaska would be too expensive to build and too risky, according to a preliminary study by Exxon Mobil Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and BP Plc, the three largest lease holders along the North Slope. The producers told Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles' natural gas development team at a meeting last week in Anchorage that the project looks like a long shot at best. The proposed pipeline would yield a rate of return on investment of about 10-11%, far less than the 15% sought by the producers. Neither the Alaska Highway route nor the Mackenzie Delta route would provide attractive enough returns to justify the enormous up-front costs associated with such a massive construction project, according to preliminary analysis by the producers. The Alaska Highway Route, which is favored by state legislators because it would bring in more tax dollars, provide in-state jobs and have less environmental impact would cost about $17.2 billion. The significantly shorter route under the Beaufort Sea and south through Canada's McKenzie River valley would cost about $15.1 billion, the companies said, according to the report. Exxon, Phillips and BP are still examining their findings but clearly consider the project a long shot. Nevertheless, they are still willing to examine potential cost cutting measures, such as reducing construction costs and streamlining the permitting process to avoid delays. ""Despite how some of the press are portraying it -- that the producers have scrapped the idea (the Canadian press was writing the obituary on the Alaska highway gas line yesterday) -- reports of its demise are greatly exaggerated, to borrow a phrase,"" said Knowles spokesman Bob King. ""Actually I think there is some good news in what they said. They talked about the project not meeting their goal of a 15% rate of return, but they did say it was profitable. In fact, they said it would provide a 10-11% rate of return. I think that portends well for the project. 
Note:  I had been sending the Arctic market intelligence to John Goodpasture.   Is your group primary on the project now, or do I continue to send to someone else?  Let me know. Arctic Resources Gains Key Aboriginal Support for Northern Pipe Arctic Resources Co., the upstart that only last year entered the myriad of pipeline proposals to move northern gas into the Lower 48, moved a few steps closer to fulfilling its dream of building a pipeline from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to Edmonton, AB, last week by earning the endorsement of key Canadian aboriginal leaders. 
Foothills CEOs Says Canada to Gain With Alaska Pipe Canadians are being assured by their two biggest natural gas transporters that they don't have to take sides in the contest over the northern pipelines because they stand to gain no matter which project wins. After carrying an estimated C$40 billion worth (US$27 billion) of exports to the United States in the past 20 years, the ""prebuild"" of the Alaska pipeline, completed by Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., predicts that far from losing, Canadians stand to gain if the country can build the missing northern link in the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS). Permanent benefits for all Canadian users of the pipeline grid are projected by Foothills co-CEOs Michael Stewart and Dennis McConaghy. Stewart is executive vice-president for business development for Westcoast Energy Inc. and McConaghy is his counterpart at TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. Foothills remains the sole owner of ANGTS's sponsor, Alaska Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., after nine U.S. partners in the original 1970s version of the project dropped out during its long dormant spell. In an interview, Stewart called Foothills a pipeline counterpart to ""the little engine that could,"" referring to the old children's story book. ""Except it's not so little,"" he said. Initially installed as an early start on southern legs in the mega-project in order to help finance the far costlier northern section, Foothills now carries about 35% of Canadian gas exports. Stewart described the reviving prospects of completing ANGTS as a further service -- this time in ""optimizing"" use of the Canadian pipeline grid. McConaghy believes that by completing the missing northern link, Canada would benefit, and Foothills has taken that case to the National Energy Board (NEB). The arrival of Alaskan gas into the 3.3 Bcf/d Foothills system would allow Canadian production to move over to TransCanada and Westcoast without forcing them to fight the new Alliance Pipeline and associated eastern links, the Vector and proposed Millennium systems. As a result,Canadians would shed the burden of costs associated with excess capacity that has emerged as a result of aggressive pipeline construction since the mid-1990s. Capacity grew so much that Natural Resources Canada estimates refilling the routes to the Lower 48 will require exports from the western provinces of about 3.8 Tcf/year - - or nearly one-third more than early-1990s industry planners estimated the region's gas fields could support on a sustained basis. Despite production increases generated by a record drilling pace over the past year, McConaghy estimated that the pipeline grid still has 1.5-2 Bcf of excess daily capacity. That poses a problem of ""defraying fixed costs,"" in his words. The problem drives an application by TransCanada to the NEB for a raise in its effective rate of return to 12.5% from 9.6%. The hike is sought to cover costs of lost traffic and compensate for increased business risks posed by the glutted, competitive Canadian market for gas-transportation services. Potentially long, hard-fought hearings are planned into how much of a raise to allow and how to translate it into toll increases for shippers still bound to use TransCanada by long delivery contracts. TransCanada has told the NEB it does not expect the cost pressure to end any time soon, if ever. At current gas discovery, sales and reserves depletion rates, TransCanada projects that the production capability of the entire Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is liable to peak and slip into decline within eight to 13 years. Some of the strain is expected to originate within the Canadian petroleum industry as it turns increasingly for its oil supplies to heavy crude and the oil sands, employing gas-fired heat extraction processes. Use of gas by oil sands mining complexes is projected to triple by 2010 to 590 MMcf/d from 190 MMcf/d. Gas use by heavy-oil operations is expected to grow almost as fast, to 730 MMcf/d in 2010 from 270 MMcf/d. Gas-fired power generation in western Canada, which is also associated with industrial expansion, is forecast to consume 980 MMcf/d by 2010, compared to 490 MMcf/d last year. When will Alaskan gas arrive to take some of the pressure off western Canadian supplies? Foothills estimates it will take five years from the time when a decision is made to go ahead on building the northern connection. That includes two years of planning, securing transportation contracts, procuring materials and satisfying regulatory and environmental requirements, followed by three years of construction. Stewart and McConaghy are not predicting when the decision to go ahead will be made, although they are continuing to advance the mega-project through preliminaries such as nailing down rights-of-way. The Foothills CEOs expect no more than hints to emerge about when the talk about the northern revival will turn into action from hearings in Anchorage, before a natural gas pipelines committee set up by the Alaska State Legislature July 17 and 18. They expect a key element -- a plan by the owners of Prudhoe Bay gas, BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum -- to take much longer to come together. Current schedules for their feasibility studies indicate it will take until the end of the year for the reports to be completed, then as much as six months longer for corporate decisions on whether to proceed to development, with BP and Exxon Mobil making comparisons between Alaskan prospects and the rest of their global inventories of projects. Foothills suggests that the northern planning exercise is evolving into a ""two-pipeline world"" and reports that it is going beyond its ANGTS interests to try to get in on proposals for a Mackenzie Valley line. Stewart and McConaghy expect markets for gas and transportation capacity to decide which line to build when, although they add that governments can make a big difference with decisions on items such as passing on delivery costs to consumers. The Foothills executives predict Canada will honor the treaty that created ANGTS if the Alaskan project is revived. 
CERA Analyst Gives Alaska Gas Pipe 60% Chance by 2008 
El Paso Proposes System-Wide Re-Allocation of Receipt Point Rights=20 With the FERC-ordered capacity re-assignments at the Topock, AZ, delivery p= oints barely off the ground, El Paso Natural Gas has proposed a plan to re-= allocate shippers' receipt point rights across its entire pipeline system i= n an attempt to improve delivery and scheduling.=20 El Paso seeks to re-allocate shippers' receipt rights in a manner similar t= o the approach that FERC ordered in late February for the re-distribution o= f firm delivery rights at the Topock delivery points. In that order, the Co= mmission directed El Paso to re-assign the delivery rights of the pipeline'= s shippers to more evenly match the design capacity of each Topock delivery= point on the system.=20 The latest proposal calls for El Paso to replace the 141 individual receipt= points on its system with 20 pooling areas. With this move, contract deman= d (CD) and full-requirements (FR) customers would continue to have system-w= ide access to the supply basins (San Juan, Permian and Anadarko) that are c= onnected to the El Paso pipeline; it just wouldn't be through a 141 differe= nt points [RP00-336-002]. ""We found it would have been virtually impossible= to divide all of those [receipt points] up in a meaningful fashion,"" said = Robert T. Tomlinson, El Paso's director of regulatory affairs.=20 Rate schedule FT-2 shippers, whose loads are ""so small,"" would be served ""r= ight off the top...they would get their gas first"" under El Paso's proposal= , he said. Rate Schedule FT-1 FR customers would be served next, Tomlinson = noted. They would be required to assign their primary receipt rights to spe= cific locations on El Paso's system, but they would retain system-wide acce= ss to alternate points.=20 Under the proposal, shippers would be allowed to choose their receipt point= right preferences based on their contract rights, El Paso told FERC. El Pa= so then would use the ""sameiterative process"" --- the one it employed in as= signing capacity to the Topock points --- to award receipt point capacity a= t the pooling areas. El Paso's re-allocation of delivery rights at the Topo= ck points took effect April 1. In a sampling of opinion from several trader= s at the Southern California border, they indicated that the new allocation= rules have improved deliveries at Topock-SoCal but at the cost of degraded= service elsewhere. ""We're still seeing some nominations cuts at Topock-SoC= al, but they're not as bad as before,"" said one marketer, adding that out o= f 12 MMcf/d he had nominated there for Thursday, he had lost only about 1 M= Mcf/d. However, the marketer and others agreed that as traders have shifted= volumes to other border points, it is creating the same kind of allocation= problems that had been plaguing Topock-SoCal. Ehrenberg is starting to exp= erience over-nominations, they said, and Wheeler Ridge ""is really a mess no= w,"" according to one source.=20 The allocation changes have had no impact on border gas prices, the traders= said. This week's spike in border quotes has been a reflection of high Cal= ifornia power prices that are being enhanced by the continuing loss of 3,00= 0 MWs due to Tuesday's downing of a line on the 500-kilovolt Pacific DC Int= ertie.=20 With respect to the new proposal, ""shippers with receipt rights in a single= basin will be allocated primary receipt rights to each pooling area within= that basin based on the proportion of each pooling areas's design receipt = capacity to the total receipt capacity within that basin,"" El Paso said, ""A= ll other shippers will be asked to provide an election that specifies a rec= eipt pool where primary rights are desired, a quantity of rights desired at= that location, and the location to which those receipt rights are to be de= livered."" CD shippers' primary receipt rights would equal their individual = CDs, while FT-1 FR shippers' share of primary rights would be based on thei= r billing determinants (BD), the pipeline said=20 It noted that shipper elections that exceed the available capacity at a spe= cific point will be allocated pro rata. ""After processing is complete, each= shipper will be notified what portion of its election was successfully all= ocated. This election and allocation process will be repeated until each sh= ipper's defined volumetric entitlements (full BD or CD) have been assigned = to primary receipt locations.""=20 In order to provide ""greater scheduling certainty"" and to ""minimize the pot= ential for capacity constraints,"" El Paso seeks to expand the number of poo= ling points on its system to 20 from six. ""Although some poolers previously= have objected to enlargement of the number of pools, saying that fewer poo= ls preserve liquidity in the gas sales market, El Paso has also been asked = by its shippers to provide greater certainty within the gas transportation = marketplace. This proposal recognizes the pipeline's overriding obligation = to its shippers.""=20 To carry out the system-wide allocation process, El Paso said it will provi= de its shippers with a ""list of the receipt points within each new pooling = area, the design capacity of each point, and the maximum quantity scheduled= through that point during the past year."" The pipeline believes its propos= al will ""allow all shippers an opportunity to make their preferences known = at the outset while providing a mechanism for resolving the inevitable conf= licts among those preferences.""=20 
El Paso Shines Up Line 2000 for Gas Conversion El Paso Natural Gas this week received approval to begin the internal cleaning of its Line 2000, which would convert the former All American oil pipeline to gas service. The internal cleaning, or ""pigging,"" will begin at the La Paz pump station, and when this portion of the conversion is completed, the project will add about 230 MMcf/d of new capacity by Aug. 31. El Paso bought the line from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. in early 2000.  It extends 1,088 miles from Emidio, CA, to McCamey, TX. The purchase also included any fiber optic rights that All American had along its entire 1,233-mile system. 
Daggett-to-Ehrenberg Lateral Gets Preliminary Thumbs Down It now appears less likely that El Paso Natural Gas will be placing new bi-directional gas transportation capacity between Daggett, CA, and Ehrenberg, AZ, to facilitate increased in-state California transportation options. The pipeline intended to use portions of the converted All American pipeline to increase capacity between the two major western market locations, but a binding open season revealed insufficient market interest, El Paso said in a bulletin board notice. The bidding process closed July 10 for the two postings of Line 1903 capacity. El Paso said it rejected all of the bids that were received on capacity offer No. 19420, which proposed firm transportation service from receipt points near Daggett to delivery points near Ehrenberg because there were insufficient volume and term commitments as required to economically justify going forward with the Line 1903 project. Additionally, no bids were received on offer No. 19418, which proposed firm transportation service from receipt points located near Ehrenberg to delivery points located near Daggett. El Paso held the binding open seasons for 400-500 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on the bi-directional lateral. In its previous non-binding open season May 1-25, El Paso said it received requests for more than 2.1 Bcf/d on the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and more than 0.9 Bcf/d on the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett path. It was offering to build capacity capable of transporting 500 MMcf/d on the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and 400 MMcf/d on the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett path. For both the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett paths, El Paso was offering a reservation rate of no greater than 10 cents/Mcf on a 100% load factor basis and was estimating a fuel charge for both paths of 1.5%. If the open seasons resulted in sufficient binding transportation agreements to make the lateral project economically viable, El Paso planned file with FERC with a goal of placing the project in service during the first quarter of 2003. El Paso said it will reevaluate the results to determine if there is enough interest to justify moving forward in some fashion with a project. 
El Paso, Enron Terminate $38 Million Mega-Deal In a stunning announcement late yesterday, El Paso Natural Gas said it had reached a ""mutual agreement"" with Enron North America Corp. to terminate the $38 million negotiated mega-deal for 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity that the marketer had entered into in December. The negotiated arrangement covers three separate capacity agreements. The decision to release Enron from the three capacity agreements was somewhat puzzling, given that Enron last week had asked to be let out of only one contract - the famed Block II agreement (614 MMcf/d) - due to the restrictions that FERC had placed on the delivery rights of the capacity.

Note:  See gas quality section at the bottom that they propose adding on their other pipelines, like they have on NGPL. Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run around FERC's Order 637, filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff procedures to avoid the more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer protests. Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories, Indicated Shippers said. They include imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality, point allocations, curtailment priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental purchase and sale, capacity release, unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous. Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316), saying ""most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI to implement elements of Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity for meaningful review and comment by KMI's customers."" Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and comment on usually routine tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted 30 days for comments on Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to make compliance filings June 15. KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed at changing its tariff to reflect ""the current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.."" It did acknowledge, ""A number of the changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's 
Sempra Could Be Takeover Candidate, Newspaper Says The London Telegraph newspaper quoted an analyst who said that U.K.-based Centrica could be eyeing Sempra Energy as a possible takeover candidate following Centrica's purchase of Canadian gas and electricity supplier Direct Energy. Direct Energy owns a 27.5% stake in Energy America, whose remaining equity belongs to Sempra. The newspaper quoted Simon Hawkins, an analyst with UBS Warburg, as saying the Direct Energy acquisition is ""step one of something much bigger."" In principle, he said, there is no reason why Centrica shouldn't go after Sempra. Centrica told the newspaper it was ""talking to Sempra about

FERC Staff Issues Favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on Guardian Pipeline The FERC Staff has issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement determining that construction of Guardian Pipeline would have limited environmental impact and would be an environmentally acceptable action, based on its proposed and other mitigation measures. The Draft covers the environmental aspects of constructing and operating the 149-mile Guardian Pipeline. FERC will take written public comments on the Draft until August 28th, and will conduct four public meetings along Guardian's route starting August 14th. It will address the comments before issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement on the project. A final decision on the Guardian Pipeline expected early next year. The Guardian Pipeline will transport volumes from interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern Gas Transmission, and NGPL at the Chicago hub to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets. The project will consist of a 25,000 horsepower of compression and 141 miles of 36 inch pipeline extending from Joliet to the Ixonia, WI, with an additional 8.5 miles of 16 inch pipeline extending from the main Guardian line to near Eagle, WI.

News : FERC Approves Independence, SupplyLink Projects 2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000 After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent agreements for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline and related SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two projects have been pending at FERC for more than three years. The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in Pennsylvania. The ""tentative"" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their downstream partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be operating a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and National Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an investment of about $1.5 billion. The Commission approved the ""greenfield"" Independence project over significant opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they were not convinced the new precedent agreements provided ""sufficient evidence"" of market support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at least 35% of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

CERA Alert 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, July 07, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Power Market Caps: Lower Prices at Higher Risk? Author: Zenker, Mortizburke E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1264 , Recent events in California, culminating in new market rules established for the energy and ancillary services markets, indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they established. The hot weather in California during June triggered high electricity demand, corresponding record-breaking power prices, and rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area. Although the economic impact of both the outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant, a recent decision by California's Independent System Operator (ISO) to intervene in the markets by lowering price caps through the summer of 2000 from $750 to $500 per megawatt-hour (MWh) may prove to be the most important product of the market events.* Ironically, the proclivity to continue to change the market rules, whatever the intention, could create market distortions that delay the addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and driving away needed capit! al. This would only prolong the state's supply shortage and resultant high prices. Although the record-setting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area is not likely to be repeated, the West as a whole will experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this summer. CERA expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand this year, but the high price levels of June will be repeated during peak demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of 2001 and possibly 2002. The Pressure Builds The blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall, but instead by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient quantities of power to the San Francisco area. The quantity of generating capacity out of service in the West was near average levels, despite a nuclear unit outage in Washington. Although the blackouts were brief and wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures, the intense scrutiny over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they designed. The market's architects assumed that competition would lower wholesale prices in the state. However, prices in June have been roughly eight times higher than in 1997's prerestructured California market, leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are flawed, requiring additional caps and market rules. Although some state officials strongly favored lo! wering the price caps, many within the ISO's Board of Governors strongly opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to tight supply and demand fundamentals. The current tight supply situation in California and the West as a whole is a product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with the slow process of permitting new power plants. Owing to strong economic growth in California in 1998 and 1999 (5.2 and 5.5 percent, respectively*), capacity margins have shrunk from 12 percent in 1997 to 7 percent in 2000. Demand growth throughout the West has reduced the amount of energy available for export from the Pacific Northwest and Southwest to California. As a result, even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the curtailment of approximately 2,800 megawatts (MW) of interruptible load within the state, California capacity margins will fall well below North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reliability criteria (roughly 15 percent) this summer. The West is the only region in North America that will experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in 1999 under normal weather conditions. CERA anticipates peak demand growth to continue to outpace new capacity additions through 2001, with slightly growing capacity margins in 2002. At these levels, an unusual amount of either plant capacity or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions would require the ISO to mandate blackouts of a portion of the state's load to maintain the overall stability of the grid. Thus, the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure prices to high levels, which may provoke legislators and regulators to attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rules. Market Distorting Effects Under tremendous pressure from some legislators, regulators, and market participants, the California ISO Board of Governors lowered the current price caps on energy from $750 to $500 per MWh in a special meeting conducted June 28.** Owing to the interconnectedness of western markets, the decision to lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to change the rules governing California's electricity markets will affect power market participants throughout the West. * Profitability of existing and future generators degraded. High power prices and volatility levels in June, although detrimental to most buyers, provide strong encouragement to plant developers. Limiting the level of price fly-ups degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a return on that capital. In most periods of the year, competition drives prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital. Generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in California's energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply scarcity. Existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the imposition of caps. * Supply shortfall prolonged. The process of siting and permitting power plants in California is cumbersome, requiring as long as five years from plant proposal to synchronization with the grid. The California Energy Commission (CEC), the state agency charged with approving new plants, has repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the state. Price-dampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that California officials may continue to reengineer the state's power markets to the detriment of generator profitability and, when added to the difficult permitting process, potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to meet rapidly growing state demand. Prominent plant developers have recently indicated that markets outside of California may provide a more stable market and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating equipment such as turbines. * Trading positions affected. Lowering price caps reduces the degree of price volatility and the level of overall average prices. Market participants have executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous, higher price cap. By lowering the price cap, not only are the value of existing physical (e.g., power plant) and financial (e.g., forward contracts) positions significantly affected, but market participants must also incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into their trading.* * Circumventing market rules. The variety of energy and capacity markets in California, as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state, provides opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules, further distorting the markets in the West. Although lowering price caps in California will likely temporarily reduce price levels, the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in the market. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert.

But the meetings did serve to highlight divisions within the three negotiating blocks and identify the most contentious areas for future discussion. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/22/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Hitting Retail Energy Over the Net: e-Commerce Companies Join the Game Author: Robertson, Behrens, Biehl E-Mail Category: Private Report Product Line: Retail Energy Forum,Energy & e-Business URL: For Retail Energy Retainer Service members: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/ref/pr/062100_12/ref_pr_062100_12_ab.html For e2 Business Retainer Service members: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/e2/pr/062100_12/e2_pr_062100_12_ab.html Summary: The retail energy industry and the Internet are becoming increasingly interlinked. The past 12 months have seen the formation of a wave of new retail energy businesses seeking ways to utilize the Internet to create a ""new"" retail energy industry. The difference is that this ""new"" industry will invert the energy supply chain and be built from the demand side (customer end) back upstream. This fosters a new role for customers and their relationship with suppliers, an expansion in the number and types of products and services being offered, and a change in the composition of the companies involved in this segment. In this Private Report we analyze these new entrants, their business models, and the prospects for success in what to date has been a difficult marketplace. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/02/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Turkish Parliament Votes on the Blue Stream Tax Protocol Author: Vatansever E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Eurasia Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/fsu/alt/060200_17/fsu_alt_060200_17_ab.html Summary: The last remaining obstacle to the Blue Stream gas pipeline project between Russia and Turkey appears about to be cleared away. Over the past two days the Turkish parliament has been debating a key tax protocol connected to the project. CERA believes the measure is very close to passage, as the Turkish governing coalition has successfully resolved its internal differences over Blue Stream. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: More Oil Is Coming into the Black Sea: Will It Cause a Bosphorus Crisis?

Author: Puyana, Scott E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/db/060500_11/la_db_060500_11_ab.html Summary: Colombia is expected to begin an economic recovery in 2000 after a contraction of over 5 percent in 1999. Despite this expansion, unemployment levels will remain stable at 19 percent, and losses incurred by companies, by individuals, and by the government through lower tax revenues during the last nine quarters of negative economic growth will not be recovered this year. The administration of Andr,s Pastrana Arango faces the difficult challenge of getting the economy back in shape at a time when his popularity is waning. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/09/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: ANP Round Two: Brazil's Upstream Auction?

This bidding round comes one year after ANP's first round, held in June 1999. The bid was well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in Brazil. Although the ANP collected lower participation fees than in the first round (US$9.0 million compared with US$9.8 million in the first round), the second round was generally considered a success. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/16/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Brazilian Power Markets: Demand Recovery Gathers Steam but Supply Questions Remain Author: Bailey, Mattos E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/061600_17/la_alt_061600_17_ab.html Summary: Brazil's power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000. February demand was 6.8 percent over February 1999 levels, and March demand grew a further 7.6 percent above the previous year. The industrial sector continued to lead the recovery with year-to-date demand growing 9.8 percent over 1999, and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7.5 percent over a similar period. As demand growth strengthened, hydro power generation increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in January. Hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by the end of April, signaling the end of the wet season. With rapidly increasing demand, particularly in the South and Southeast regions, Brazil could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several months are delayed. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Mexico after the Elections: The Real Battle Begins Author: Puyana E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/db/062000_12/la_db_062000_12_ab.html Summary: For the first time in many decades, the presidential and parliamentary campaigns are highly competitive, and the results of these democratically conducted elections will have a large impact on the effectiveness and future of the new administration. However, the real political battle begins after the elections. Indeed, the winning party will have to exercise all its political skills to create coalitions and advance negotiations in order to take control of the government.

Two years later, the country is no closer to peace, and resolution of the ongoing negotiations is uncertain at best. This prolongation and stagnation of the peace process has had a direct negative impact on energy sector investment in Colombia. The government will likely proceed with formal negotiations, but time--and Pastrana's remaining term in office--is running out. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/30/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Argentine Power Markets: Winter Constraints Push Prices Higher in May Author: Bailey E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://www.cera.com/client/la/alt/063000_16/la_alt_063000_16_ab.html Summary: Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing to the combination of continued low hydro output, strong demand growth, and periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos Aires region. Spot power prices (energy component only) averaged $18.24 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in May. Although average power prices declined from last year, price volatility increased, with several short-duration episodes of prices over $60 per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region forced several midcost units offline during peak hours. In June, prices are expected to continue strengthening to the $24-$28 per MWh range on average. Beyond June, price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing hydro output, new and returning low-cost thermal capacity, and the end of gas constraints push average prices back toward $15 per MWh or below by August or September. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/01/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: US Gas Markets Reach New Heights: Where Will It Stop? Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/060100_15/nag_alt_060100_15_ab.html Summary: The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as $4.50 per MMBtu--up from less than $3.00 per MMBtu during April. Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply, the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation. The gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories, with injections so far this spring running between 1.5 and 2.0 Bcf per day below last year's rate. The continued tension between these two forces will keep the pressure on prices this summer, and the need to inject gas into storage will price out increments of demand. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/alt/061500_16/nag_alt_061500_16_ab.html Summary: Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factors--the increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound--call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. Prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years. In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer--with pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise--with the result that gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use demand. CERA expects a July average price of $4.45 per MMBtu. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Western Canada Supply Growth: Getting Nowhere Faster Author: Eynon, Small E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/db/061500_18/nag_db_061500_18_ab.html Summary: As US supply declines and demand grows, current high gas prices are reinforced, but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering when it is needed most. Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie the disappointing production growth results. The largely weather-related transitory factors have had a near-term impact on drilling and connection activity. The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time. More shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well production rates. Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace production. With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling, higher supply growth rates are possible, but if that does not occur, other potential supply sources may step in. Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight. Coal bed methane has become a str! ong source of US supply. Although now ignored in Canada, it may become a future source of Canadian gas. ********************************************************************** CERA Watch : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Reaching New Heights Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Watch Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/wch/061600_11/nag_wch_061600_11_ab.html Summary: Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the development of spot markets. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/21/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Closing the Utility Stock Valuation Gap: Does Strategy Matter? Author: Parshley E-Mail Category: Private Report Product Line: North American Power URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/pr/062000_14/nap_pr_062000_14_ab.html Summary: The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility industry. Traditionally undervalued in the market, the sector is trading at a historically wide 50 percent discount to Standard and Poor's S&P 500. The S&P Utility Index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent, with huge gains by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 electric utilities. Yet early this year, the SPU outpaced all other industry groups. How should constantly evolving utilities in this wide-open sector form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success? The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999--a record $50 billion--was double the 1998 value. But are these choices ahead of the curve? And when will the market catch up? Three groups of new companies with distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape: multiservice and technology providers, superregionals, and global power and ! energy companies. Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating responses to these challenges. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Summer 2000 Spot Electricity Markets Outlook: Divergent Trends in Price Volatility Author: Makovich, Sannicandro E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: North American Power URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/db/062200_18/nap_db_062200_18_ab.html Summary: While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price spikes this summer, other markets are likely to see a reversal in price volatility as supply-demand balances improve dramatically. One way to interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations. Therefore, forward prices for on-peak wholesale power reflect the common expectation that prices will spike as high as--or even higher than--in 1999. A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/02/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Atlantic Basin Gasoline Markets Soar Author: Meyers E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/rp/alt/060200_17/rp_alt_060200_17_ab.html Summary: Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season, spot gasoline-to-crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War. In CERA's view, this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors: very low inventories, tightening gasoline specifications, and legal uncertainty. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/13/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products Line--US Markets Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/061300_18/rp_alt_061300_18_ab.html Summary: The US gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during May. US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline surged to $8.40 per barrel measured against WTI, up $3.58 per barrel over the strong April value of $4.82. Apparent demand for gasoline skyrocketed to 8.64 million barrels per day (mbd) in response to the start of the summer driving season. Despite increases in the reported demand for distillate and jet/kerosene, these markets did not experience the same month-over-month strength in differentials, dropping to $1.58 and $2.58 per barrel versus WTI, respectively. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products Line--European Markets Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/062000_14/rp_alt_062000_14_ab.html Summary: As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials to Brent and thus lower refinery margins, refiners attempted to prevent this situation from worsening by reducing throughputs. However, very tight markets for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the fall in those products' values. Meanwhile, fuel oil discounts to crude oil widened in May, driving down simple/hydroskimming margins. In recent weeks, the combination of lower primary products inventories and reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to recover. This has pushed margins to above May's averages, although still below April's peaks. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/26/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Recent Actions Signal Progress Toward MTBE Elimination Author: Stackpole E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/rp/alt/062600_16/rp_alt_062600_16_ab.html Summary: The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline (RFG) now faces from the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) use in the US gasoline pool. Additional signposts, including heightened congressional debate over legislation eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE, continue to emerge that point the way toward MTBE-free gasoline in the United States. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/29/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products: Market Update Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/062900_16/rp_alt_062900_16_ab.html Summary: Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences. In the Atlantic Basin, low gasoline inventories in both the United States and Europe, which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint, continue to dominate the market, and gasoline differentials above crude are at their highest level in over ten years. Although signs are emerging of a possible correction in the North American market in the coming month, the 2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by Atlantic Basin refiners in many years. In contrast, Asia Pacific spot refining margins were weak through most of June, until the recent accident at KPC's Mina al-Ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt Singapore margins. However, with ample unused refining capacity available east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in July, CERA's outlook is for that strength to be of short duration. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: New Peaks, New Prices Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/ce/alt/062300_17/ce_alt_062300_17_ab.html Summary: In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and steadily rising power prices. CERA expect the West to be the only region in North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. The convergence of higher gas prices, growing power demand, and reduced hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up western power prices. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer ! power loads. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Oil Market Turmoil: OPEC Seeks a Short-term Fix Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/061500_18/wo_alt_061500_18_ab.html Summary: Driven by strong demand--especially in the recovering Asian economies and the United States--oil prices (both WTI and Brent) have again broken the $30 level--a mark that is of particular significance in this US election year. In turn, the oil market's attention is again fixed on OPEC, as it prepares for its June 21 meeting, but its members are deeply divided over how to respond. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/16/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The State of the Oil Market: Market Supported, Psychology Enhanced, and OPEC Driven Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/061600_19/wo_alt_061600_19_ab.html Summary: The key ingredient in the volatile oil market is the new OPEC--and its successful implementation of a strategy to keep supply one half step behind demand-driving inventories down for crude, with the side effect of lowering stocks for several products in markets such as the United States and Europe. Three features of the current oil market are supporting prices: * Market supported * Psychology enhanced * OPEC driven ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/22/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: OPEC's Cautious New Agreement Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/062200_16/wo_alt_062200_16_ab.html Summary: OPEC's agreement to raise its production quota beginning July 1 by 708,000 barrels per day to 25.4 million barrels per day is consistent with its strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low levels. The gain in supply is a short-term fix meant to alleviate political pressure for increased production and to push prices below $30 but keep them in a mid- to upper $20s range. **end** Follow URL for HTML Version of this message only.

NEW POWER PLANT ADDED TO PNM SYSTEM PNM, Public Service Company of New Mexico, now has an additional 132 megawatts of electricity available to help meet peak summer demand.  A new gas-fired generating plant, Delta-Person Station, is now fully operational in Albuquerque, PNM announced this week. 
CERA Alert: December 13, 2000 Title: California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible. Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a challenging siting and permitting process. Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of California's electric market woes.* * Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities. * Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. * Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development. * Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development. * Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust. CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state. Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage. The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall: * Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? * Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build. * Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence (and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments. * Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response. * Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) future price volatility. * Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its course. * Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions. * Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power. **end** This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours. ********************************************************************** This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

FERC Restructures California Power Market Responding to a California power market gone haywire and teetering on the brink of operational and financial disaster, FERC Friday issued a series of remedial measures, virtually stripping the Cal-PX and Cal-ISO of their control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate bilateral forward contracts. The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange (Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market. FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec. 19 in Washington of parties in the state's power market to negotiate those contracts. ""California does [not] have the benefit of a competitive market,"" Chairman James Hoecker said, noting he had heard the state's power market called ""crisis by design."" The design was ""an unworkable state law, the product of command and control that described in detail"" exactly how the market should function. ""It wasn't competition,"" Hoecker said. ""It's time to get serious about saving the future of competitive markets...Competition did not fail in principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never 
Title: Into the Stratosphere URL: http://www20.cera.com/client/knowledgearea/report/0,1448,CID1295_KID8_SRTDAT_T YPRPT,00.html High demand, perilously low storage inventories, and a supply response that is only beginning have driven gas prices in North America to stratospheric levels. The physical shortfall is now real enough, and prices have risen well above previous record highs to levels that should drive any demand that can realistically do so to leave the market. Gas is now pricing near the level of distillate for the first time ever, providing strong economic incentives to push to maximum levels of fuel switching. ?

Shippers Condemn Northwest's Must-Flow OFOs Several northern Nevada industrial gas users have accused Northwest Pipeline of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily must-flow operational flow orders (OFOs) that it has issued since early December in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system. In a Section 5 complaint filed Friday, the industrial gas customers called on FERC to direct Northwest to ""cease and desist"" the alleged violation of the tariff, which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of Northwest's system. The effect of the must-flow OFOs is to compel shippers to make up the capacity shortfall on Northwest's system via displacement, the industrials noted. Northwest's firm contractual demand is 720,000 Dth/d, but its physical capacity is only 474,000 Dth/d. Pan-Alberta Gas (U.S.) Inc. provides 144,000 Dth/d through a displacement arrangement, while shippers are left to make up the remaining 102,000 Dth/d. The industrial users contend they shouldn't be penalized for not complying with the must-flow OFOs because Northwest's tariff exempts shippers that have made ""good faith efforts"" to obtain gas supply, but have been unsuccessful. At issue is whether the ""good faith efforts"" applies to purchasing gas at reasonable costs, which is how the industrials interpret the tariff, or

PG&E to Expand Pacific Northwest System Responding to tight energy supplies in the Pacific Northwest and California, PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group revealed plans Wednesday to begin an open season early next year, kicking off a five-year expansion effort. The first phase would add 200 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity out of western Canada on its Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) pipeline system. The PG&E GTN group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by November 2002 at the latest. ""As we have been anticipating, the western natural gas market is at a critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity,"" said Thomas B. King, president of the PG&E National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) West Region. ""Gas supplies into the Pacific Northwest and California are very tight. At the same time, the market is strong and growing, and the PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum capacity levels for the greater part of the year. We believe GTN is now positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional supplies of natural gas --- at competitive transportation rates --- in this 
NGPL Recontracts with NIPSCO Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter. Since Kinder Morgan took over NGPL parent KN Energy last year, the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the Midwest, including another deal announced yesterday with Northern Indiana Public Service (NIPSCO). NGPL and NIPSCO signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling 295,100 MMBtu/d of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and Dec. 1, 2001 and continuing through Nov. 30, 2002. They also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling 10.5 Bcf of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001 and continuing through March 31, 2003. NIPSCO, a NiSource subsidiary, is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly 700,000 customers and electricity to 416,000 customers across the northern third of Indiana. ""Virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year,"" said NGPL President Deborah Mcdonald in an interview. ""Basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year. We've been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [NiGas, NIPSCO and Peoples]."" Despite increasing competitive pressure from Northern Border and Alliance Pipeline, the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators. ""In contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the Midcontinent and Louisiana to Chicago, we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core LDCs. Obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with Aquila Energy for 500,000 MMBtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts,"" Mcdonald said. ""We also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power generators. Growth in NGPL will come from natural gas-fired generation. You probably saw our press release about the Ameren contracts for [construction of 1,700 MW of generation along the NGPL system]. In the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3,000 MW of gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 MW next year as well [which would represent up to 900 MMcf/d in gas transportation capacity]. ""Obviously another challenge is going to be [the 1.325 Bcf/d] Alliance Pipeline coming into the market this fall. It's anyone's guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time. I think a lot of that will be coming into Chicago and moving back out on Vector. But we're ready at Hub America to kind of serve as a giant header system [with Texas Eastern as 
El Paso Proceeding with NM Pipe Integrity Testing El Paso Natural Gas has received approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) to conduct more internal inspections on its rebuilt New Mexico pipeline, which ruptured August 19 killing 11 people (see Daily GPI, Aug. 22). Since the explosion, flows through the line, which runs from West Texas to California, have been reduced to 85% capacity, or about 920 MMcf/d. OPS said the El Paso line has already been repaired and put through hydrostatic testing, which it passed. Hydrostatic testing checks for cracks by forcing high-pressure water through the line. Now El Paso has the green light to begin smart pig testing, which will examine the internal integrity of the line. The device, called a pig because of the sound it makes during inspections, has sensors and once placed inside the line, it can detect dents, deformities and changes in wall thickness. Neither OPS nor El Paso released a timetable as to when the pigging would occur or how long it would take. However, once the testing is completed, the results will be evaluated by OPS, which then would determine if the line were safe for commercial use. OPS has not issued actual regulations on smart pig use, but they have become increasingly sophisticated and more widely used. Even though hydrostatic testing can actually detect certain flaws that are invisible to smart pigs, the pigging process is considered a complement to the water testing and ensures more integrity in test results. OPS requires all pipe to undergo at least one hydrostatic test after construction. Although not mandated, OPS also has proposed requiring pipelines that transport liquid petroleum products to use direct assessment methods such as pigging to evaluate the pipeline's integrity. Other types of inspections include using magnetic particles or ultrasound to measure the pipe wall's thickness. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  Did this request really happen this way?  Why would the FERC ask one pipeline to expand and not all of them feeding the state.  What have you all heard? FERC Asks El Paso to Expand A key FERC staffer this week asked El Paso Natural Gas to consider switching its Line 2000 crude-oil conversion from a replacement project to an expansion of its existing system to ease pipeline capacity constraints to the California border. ""I am writing to inquire about the feasibility of modifying the...project in a manner which could assist the difficult situation now confronting the California gas market,"" said Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects. In August, El Paso filed an application to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso seeks to convert the 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion. ""It appears that if El Paso kept the six...compressor stations on the line and implemented any necessary facility additions and modifications to integrate the converted line with its existing South System, it may be 
DEFS Finishes 2000 With Multiple Transactions Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) finished off 2000 with a bang by completing three year-end asset transactions. First, the company finalized the $91 million sale of natural gas liquid (NGL) pipeline assets to TEPPCO Crude Pipeline, L.P., then it completed the purchase of certain natural gas pipeline assets from El Paso Field Services in two separate deals for an undisclosed sum. The assets sold to TEPPCO include the Panola Pipeline and the San Jacinto Pipeline, both of which are NGL pipelines. Under the agreement, TEPPCO also agreed to take over the lease of a 34-mile condensate pipeline. The three pipelines included in the sale all originate at DEFS' East Texas Plant Complex located in Panola County, TX.

Breaking News : California Stakeholders Agree to Key Objectives posted 10:18 AM (CST) Jan 10, 2001 Signs of compromise and cooperation emerged from a marathon seven-hour meeting last night between California government officials, power industry executives and the Clinton administration on California's continuing energy crisis. A set of key principles were hammered out by the two dozen participants, according to a statement issued following the meeting. The stakeholders agreed on the need for cooperation to ""maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy of California utilities and assure the long-term regularity of market conditions."" The utilities have amassed $12 billion in unrecovered wholesale power costs, and despite the recent approval of new rate surcharges the utilities remain on the brink of financial insolvency. The meeting participants agreed on a few crucial elements of a solution to California's power woes, including the following: development of approaches to promote long-term purchases of power, possibly by the state, from generators at an ""attractive fixed rate;"" the willingness of generators and qualifying facilities and marketers to provide on a short-term basis ""forebearance of amounts owed by Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison"" in the context of a comprehensive solution; the need to find ""satisfactory approaches"" to the utilities' obligations to purchase power; cooperation to ""better match supply and demand;"" and review of the existing qualifying facilities payment structures. Working groups are meeting today in Washington, D.C. to address additional technical details and the senior policy makers will reconvene this weekend to complete an agreement. FERC Chairman James Hoecker, said it was ""to early to declare victory,"" but it was ""an important first step to try to find ways to maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy."" Hoecker, who also announced today that he will be leaving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Jan. 18, said the atmosphere at the meeting was highly cooperative. ""They appear to be headed in the direction that would seem to be consistent with FERC's Dec. 15 order,"" he said.

Note:  The EIA says that gas storage levels at the end of December were 10% lower than the previous record low set in 1976. They have revised their price forecast for 2001 to $5.20 (with the heating season at $6.23) and estimate that 2000 will come in at $3.70. EIA Raises Price Forecasts, Confirms Dire Storage Situation The Energy Information Administration (EIA) again raised its wholesale and retail gas price projections for the winter and confirmed that gas storage levels at the end of December were lower by 10% than the previous record low set in 1976. Strong demand during November and December, which the National Weather Service has said were the coldest on record, reduced gas stocks to record lows for the period, and continued cold should keep storage low and prices very high for the remainder of the heating season, EIA said yesterday in its Short Term Energy Outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2000, gas-weighted heating degree-days were estimated to have been up by 28% over last year's relatively mild fourth quarter. Gas demand increased 10% over the year prior. Over the entire six months of winter (Oct. 1, 2000 to March 31, 2001), EIA projects demand will rise by 7% compared to the prior winter, with residential and commercial sector demand up by 17% over last winter. EIA now expects wellhead prices to average $5.20/Mcf in 2001 compared to an estimated $3.70 in 2000 (72% higher than in 1999) and about $4.50 projected for 2002. It also raised its projections on retail prices to 70% above winter 1999-2000 levels. The expected 45% increase in the nominal average residential price would be

El Paso Merchant Ordered to Relinquish Data FERC yesterday ordered El Paso Merchant Energy to stop stonewalling and turn over protected materials to parties involved in a complaint case in which it's alleged the affiliate received preferential treatment when it acquired 1.2 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. Specifically, the Commission denied El Paso Merchant's request for rehearing of a June 2000 order that granted in part the discovery sought by the California Public Utilities Commission, and rejected rehearing of a September protective order. The latter directed El Paso Merchant to make available to all intervening parties, who agreed to the terms of the protective order, all of the materials that were being submitted to the CPUC and FERC in the case. So far, El Paso Merchant has refused to release the information to these parties, claiming the materials being filed with the CPUC and FERC are for ""Government Eyes Only."" It also argues that the protective order offers inadequate protection of commercially sensitive information. The Commission disagreed. ""El Paso Merchant has not substantiated or sufficiently justified its broad claim that all of the 'protected materials' provided to CPUC and this Commission warrant the designation 'Government Eyes Only.' Indeed, all of the information that El Paso Merchant seeks to shield...relates directly to the issues,"" the order said [RP00-241]. Also, FERC finds that the protective order provides ""sufficient protection for El

American Electric Power Buys Houston Pipe Line American Electric Power Thursday announced it has made a major move to expand its wholesale natural gas business in the Southwest, agreeing to acquire the 2.4 Bcf/d Houston Pipe Line (HPL) along with the Bammel storage field, one of the largest storage fields in North America, from Enron. AEP said since some details remain to be worked out, it was not disclosing the terms of the transaction at this time. AEP will be acquiring the stock of HPL and it expects to complete the deal in the next couple months. HPL, one of the two original pipelines joined by Enron Chairman Ken Lay to form the company in the mid-1980s, has an extensive 4,400 mile transportation and gathering system through southern Texas. The 118 Bcf Bammel field, located near the Houston Ship Channel market area, has a 65.7 Bcf working gas capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities. It has a 1.4 Bcf/d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 MMcf/d injection capacity. ""Adding HPL to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of becoming a top-10 gas trader and marketer,"" said Paul Addis, executive vice president for AEP. The company currently is second in the U.S. in electricity volume. ""HPL will enhance AEP's natural gas business with its multiple connections into the production areas of Texas, its numerous interconnects with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around 
CA Power Market Awaits Bailout California power watchers were hoping for results early this week from the marathon government-industry negotiations. The principals of last Tuesday night's marathon session were expected to meet by video-conference over the weekend to review solutions developed by staff working groups, which met through the end of the week. (see Daily GPI, Jan. 11) On the West Coast the week ended with emergency legislation starting its dash through the state capital, and the governor holding a 90-minute meeting with two neighboring western governors to piece together a regional strategy on joint energy conversation/supply cooperation. On Friday Gov. Gray Davis said if FERC fails to act, he is sure Congress will take up legislation to stabilize power prices throughout the country, ""or at least give governors the option to opt into a stabilized pricing mechanism. Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-CA, announced she was working on a bill to be offered later this month, which would allow the energy secretary to impose price caps. Davis indicated that he and federal officials would be working over the weekend and he expects to have something to announce early next week, and in the long term he expects to ""solve this problem in the next 90 days and in 
CMS, DEFS Swap Strategic Properties In a strategic move said to benefit both midstream energy companies, CMS Field Services Inc. has swapped some of its natural gas assets in Oklahoma and Kansas for some of Duke Energy Field Services' similar assets onshore and offshore Louisiana. DEFS' natural gas gathering and condensate measuring and transportation assets onshore and offshore Louisiana were exchanged with CMS Field Services' assets in Oklahoma and Kansas, giving each company more proximity to their other assets. The deal closed Dec. 20 and was announced Friday. No financial details were disclosed. 
Texas Power Plants to Add 2,775 MW this Month Five power plants with 2,775 MW of new generating capacity are being tested in the ERCOT and all should be operating commercially before the end of this month. The 500 MW Unit 2 at FPL's Lamar County plant is expected to be commercial soon. Calpine's 545 MW expansion of its Pasadena plant in Harris County is running but has not yet gone commercial. LG&E Power Services' 400 MW Gregory Power Partners plant in San Patricio County and American National Power's 500 MW Midlothian plant in Ellis County are set to go commercial within days.

Breaking News: CA Governor Declares State of Emergency posted 2:37 AM (CST) Jan 18, 2001 Late Wednesday following a day of rolling blackouts and the prospect for more with electricity supplies drying up throughout the West, California Gov. Gray Davis declared a state of emergency due to the power shortage and directed the state water resources department to begin securing power supplies for the beleaguered state grid. In making the bold move, Gov. Davis also announced that his conservation plan for state facilities and operations already has reached its goal of reducing energy use by more than 5%. In the emergency proclamation, the governor said that electricity presently available through California three major investor-owned utilities is ""insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruptions of electric service,"" and thus, he was ordering all state agencies to use their resources to do whatever they can to alleviate the power shortage. Then he went on to specifically empower the water resources agency, which has been a key player in helping the state's transmission grid operator (Cal-ISO) narrowly avoid blackouts or avoid them being felt more pervasively throughout the state. Noting that peak electrical loads for state buildings and institutions are on target for a 200 MW reduction and the water resources department peak pumping load has been reduced by 450 MW, Gov. Davis lauded Californians for having ""stepped up to the plate and dramatically reduced their appetite for electricity,"" noting that the state already is 47th in the nation among the lowest per-capita energy use and the state's electricity prices are the 10th 
El Paso Says It's Open to Expansion of System El Paso Natural Gas ""is willing to expand its system"" to the California border if ""sufficient support"" for such a project can be demonstrated through long-term capacity contracts, the pipeline told FERC. The pipeline's comments were in response to a Commission inquiry asking El Paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed Line 2000 crude-oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the West.  Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, raised the prospect in a Jan. 3 letter to El Paso, saying that modifying the project ""could assist the difficult situation"" now facing the California gas market. Specifically, the Commission has recommended that El Paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion. 
Enron Q4 profit rises 32 percent Strong business mix pushes energy firm past estimates MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 2001 11:19:00 AM EST By Andrew Kelly HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas, on Monday reported a sharp rise in fourth-quarter operating earnings, surpassing expectations, as online trading drove strong growth at its core wholesale energy operations. Enron said it took a net non-recurring after-tax charge of $287 million in the fourth quarter related to its troubled water affiliate Azurix Corp. AZX </quotes/quotes.asp?symb=AZX&source=>. Enron announced plans last year to finance a buyout that would take Azurix private. Earnings before non-recurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 million, or 41 cents a share, from $259 million or 31 cents a share a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 35 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. In early Monday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron's shares were up $3-1/8, or 4.41 percent, at $74. Fourth-quarter net income including the Azurix charge was $60 million, or 5 cents per share. The company's fourth-quarter revenues rose 271 percent from a year earlier, to $40.8 billion. ""The impressive thing is the overall growth that they experienced,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. ""I think it had been in most people's

Bush Administration Extends Emergency Supply Orders Despite recent indications that the Bush administration would take a more hands-off approach to the California crisis, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham late yesterday gave PG&E and Southern California Edison another two weeks of breathing room by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power suppliers to continue supplying the cash-strapped utilities. The emergency gas order now expires at 3 a.m. (EST) Feb. 7. In granting the extensions, Abraham urged the state to get to work to solve its own problems. He said only California can implement the policies necessary to resolve the short-term and long-term supply challenges. ""Our action today is designed to give the governor, the California legislature and other relevant parties the time to take necessary action. I strongly urge the parties to act immediately,"" said Abraham. He also said he was keenly aware that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas. Despite the action, PG&E said it still is having trouble getting gas suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued Jan. 19. ""The gas supply situation is [not good],"" utility spokeswoman Staci Homrig said yesterday afternoon. ""We are quickly depleting our storage. Even under the order, J. Aron & Co. [a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs] has not delivered gas. They represent about 9% of our daily needs (1.5 Bcf/d in January). ""Oh yeah, we've been in contact with them,"" she said. ""We've been in contact with the DOE, too. The other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to us last week have made gas available to us under the order. They are Sempra Energy Trading and Western Gas Resources."" Homrig said PG&E expected DOE to take legal action against those who didn't resume deliveries. The order applied to 27 gas suppliers, all of which supplied gas to PG&E within the last 30 days. ""There's not a lot I can say,"" said J. Aron spokeswoman Kate Baum. ""J. Aron has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order.

Breaking News: Cal-PX Shuts Down Trading posted 2:47 PM (CST) Jan 30, 2001 In direct reaction to federal regulatory moves Monday, the California Power Exchange (Cal-PX) board decided to shut down day-ahead and day-of wholesale electricity markets by noon Wednesday, Jan. 31. Today will be the last day of trading for the day-ahead, and Wednesday the final day for the day-of, bringing to a close one part of the state's initial 1996 electric industry restructuring law that created the state-chartered, nonprofit public benefits corporation to provide a wholesale spot market through which California's three major investor-owned utilities were required to buy and sell all of their wholesale power. They are no longer required to do so. ""Regrettably, Cal-PX must take this extraordinary action in response to Monday's FERC order that directs us to immediately comply with the terms of its Dec. 15 order and implement a $150/MWh breakpoint,"" said Cal-PX CEO George Sladoje, who noted that there is a Feb. 7 oral argument set for the power exchanges emergency motion and petition with the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, requesting a stay and rehearing of the original FERC Dec. 15 order. The Cal-PX will not close down entirely as yet. It will continue to perform all scheduling and settlement services for its current participants.

CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing A special session yesterday of California's regulators gave PG&E's utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb. 7 when the current federal DOE emergency order expires, but it postponed action on another PG&E request that Southern California Gas Co. --- which has strongly objected --- be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PG&E utility's residential and small business customers. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said PG&E's utility is a ""victim --- a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers,"" now demanding payment for future supplies up front --- not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its credit-worthiness. The CPUC action allows PG&E's utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PG&E's gas utility operations while the credit-worthiness of the company itself is dubious. It won't be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation, according to PG&E gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig. On the operational side, PG&E on Wednesday declared a low-inventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system. The action was thought to help cause the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point, Homrig said. Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. ""These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh,"" Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. ""Suppliers who have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Wed, July 26, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The West: Keeping Its Fingers Crossed Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1286 , A strong dose of summer weather in June propelled West-wide demand levels up by nearly 12 percent over the same period in 1999. These higher demand levels provided the year's first example of the power price spikes that can be produced when the West's tight capacity intersects with normal summer load levels, lower-than-normal hydroelectric levels, strong gas prices, and California's immature wholesale power market structure. As power markets reacted in June with unprecedented price strength throughout the region, regulators and the California Independent System Operator (ISO) intervened to dampen markets from a maximum of $750 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to $500 per MWh.* Although some market participants have filed protests at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to raise or eliminate the caps, utilities, legislators, and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market. As western markets move through the critical July-August peak electricity demand period, market participants and regulators alike are wondering if power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in June. CERA expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer weather conditions, barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages. However, normal August weather conditions will push demand levels significantly higher than in June, creating an even tighter supply-demand balance, straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key demand regions adequately. A hot weather event could exhaust both in-state and imported supplies for California. The tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong price response, similar to that in June. This will fuel the unease of regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that are considering restructuring. Even as regulators' continued support of restructured power markets begins to waver, a weather event that forces regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene. CERA's outlook for August power markets is driven by * High peak loads. Under normal weather conditions, West-wide August loads will be on average 1,400 megawatts (MW) higher than last August. The peak load in California is expected to push capacity margins to 6 percent, even after curtailing interruptible load. * Lower hydroelectric output. As the West enters its peak load period, hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly 3,900 average megawatts (aMW) from July to August. Compared with the high, sustained output of last August, hydroelectric output this August, although roughly average on a historical basis, will be roughly 4,900 aMW (20 percent) lower. * High levels of gas-fired generation. Compared with August 1999, higher utilization rates, along with gas prices that have climbed $1.88 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), will increase the incremental cost of energy production by over $20 per MWh. Although CERA expects power prices in August to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness, higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all periods of the day. The extremely tight power supply-demand balance within the West, and within California specifically, has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand for power generation. This high demand level-combined with seasonal storage injection needs in California-has pushed up utilization rates on pipelines into California and pushed Topock differentials over $0.75 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub. Strong demand should continue through August in the West and support premium pricing at Topock. The Rocky Mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed on Topock deliveries. In the Rockies supply is building relative to export pipeline capacity, and market access is becoming a challenge. Weak seasonal demand compounds the problem; the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the Rockies. Generation within the region remains nearly all coal-fired. These regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through September. Moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the Henry Hub. However, summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels. Higher gas prices are likely to resurface. Regional Power Market Drivers August demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional 7 percent, or nearly 5,500 aMW, over average June levels (see Table 1). Peak demand levels should exceed those in June as well, with a coincident peak over the whole Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) of 118,600 MW expected under normal weather conditions in 2000, a 2.7 percent increase over the weather-muted 1999 peak. California alone should experience peak loads that are approximately 3,600 MW higher than peak levels in June. Available generation capacity in the West has been at normal levels for this time of year, although coal-fired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but short-lived outages. The steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove 3,900 aMW from the West resource base when compared with July levels and about 6,800 aMW since June, although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of June. Given hydro operators' economic interest in maximizing on-peak production at the expense of off-peak production, the loss of capacity during the on-peak period will be lower than these levels. August will be a critical month for the heavily import-dependent state of California. While the state will be drawing approximately 7,000 aMW of imports during August to meet demands during peak periods, CERA expects the level of imports to exceed 8,200 MW during peak demand conditions. The Southwest's need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to California, and lower year-over-year hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest will limit exports from that region. Pacific Northwest CERA expects Pacific Northwest demand in August to climb by nearly 1,300 aMW when compared with June levels. The water supply for the Pacific Northwest has declined to 91 percent of normal levels for the Lower Columbia owing to warmer-than-normal weather in June. In addition, normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about 6,000 aMW from the resource base when compared with levels in June (see Table 2). Generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gas-fired generation at high levels. Although less than 4,000 MW of gas-fired generation is currently available in the region, it has been running at high utilization rates. High energy demand in California for Pacific Northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions. As in June, Pacific Northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility CERA expects to occur in California in August. In addition, if hot weather in the Pacific Northwest pressures regional energy reserves, local prices will rise to keep energy in the region, potentially causing prices in the Pacific Northwest to move higher than those to the south. California California is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance. Although hydroelectric output continues to decline, statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly 118 percent of normal. Nevertheless, declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about 730 aMW when compared with hydroelectric production levels in June. Normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about 3,600 aMW over June levels, which were high (see Table 3). California's peak load is expected to exceed 57,000 MW, compared with a peak load in June of approximately 53,500 MW (43,447 MW on the state's ISO system alone, according to its own estimate). Assuming normal plant outage rates, this demand level will necessitate the import of about 8,200 MW of energy to meet the statewide peak. Even after curtailing the approximately 2,800 MW of interruptible load available for tight supply situations, the state has a precarious 6 percent capacity margin during the system peak. An extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional 3,000 MW. Outages are likely if additional imports are not available. A capacity limit of 4,600 MW will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the Pacific Northwest to Northern California. The import limit from the Pacific Northwest to southern California will be 3,100 MW. Rockies and Southwest August demand levels in the combined Rockies/Southwest region will increase only slightly above levels in August 1999, climbing approximately 275 aMW, as loads in the region-unlike the rest of the below-average WSCC-were near normal last August. Even so, August loads will increase demand by over 1,250 aMW when compared with levels in June of this year. As with last year and this June, supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather, although growing loads in the Rockies/Southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions. High loads driven by hot weather will keep the region's prices high. Differentials between the region and California will be tight, but California, having tighter supply-demand balances, will need to price at a premium to attract energy. The high-capacity transmission ties between the Rockies/Southwest and the California market, which is about 150 percent the size of the Rockies/Southwest market, will ensure that prices in the Rockies/Southwest stay close behind California prices whenever loads are high in California. Regional Gas Market Drivers Evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the West, and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures. Since the Northern Border expansion in late 1998, narrow north-south and east-west differentials across pricing points defined the market. This summer, the continuing supply growth in the Rocky Mountains has widened differentials between the Rockies and the rest of the West. At Topock, increasing gas demand in California and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums. Overall in North American gas markets, strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices-from an early July Henry Hub price of $4.50 per MMBtu to under $4.00 per MMBtu. However, despite these high injection rates, the supply-demand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious. Summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices. The ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average Henry Hub price of $4.20 per MMBtu in August. Through the end of the summer, differentials in the West should hold near current levels. The pressure of growing Rocky Mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall. In California high seasonal power loads should continue through August with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation. Demand strength is expected to continue. Across the West, August demand for gas should climb from 9.8 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day in June to 10.4 Bcf per day, buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation (see Table 4). California High gas demand for power generation within California will continue through August. CERA expects an increase from the state's June demand levels of 5.6 Bcf per day to 6.2 Bcf per day during August. The increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads. Total demand is expected to exceed last year's demand level by 1.2 Bcf per day. This will increase flows on pipelines into California, reduce the state's storage surplus, and sustain high prices. CERA expects pipeline utilization rates during August to average 95 percent (see Table 5). CERA expects an August Topock-Henry Hub differential of $0.45 per MMBtu (see Table 6). Pacific Northwest Despite the extremely high prices at Topock and high demand in California, until recently gas at Malin priced at a slight discount to Henry Hub prices. After averaging $0.17 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during the third quarter last year, the differential so far during the third quarter this year is $0.15 per MMBtu below the Hub. This week Malin is pricing at a $0.25 per MMBtu premium relative to the Henry Hub. The Topock-Malin differential has swelled to over $0.60 per MMBtu, signaling intra-California pipeline capacity constraints. Two factors pressured Malin differentials during the early summer. * Pressure on Rocky Mountain and AECO differentials. Prices in the two areas supplying the Pacific Northwest are under some pressure. Increasing supplies in the Rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on Rockies prices by limiting external market access. At AECO, although export capacity out of the province is available, almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern Canada on TransCanada Pipeline. Pipelines into the United States are running near capacity. Because of TransCanada's limited ability to discount interruptible transport, the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled. * Low early summer regional demand. Gas demand in the Pacific Northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output. Even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year, seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in May and June even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in California. Increasing power loads are already evident. The first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the Rockies and western Canada begins climbing. However, gas demand for power generation in the Pacific Northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of July and into August as hydroelectric generation wanes. This added demand-200 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day above June demand levels-will provide some support for Malin prices and limited support for Rockies and AECO prices. Malin-Henry Hub differentials are expected to average $0.05 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price during August. Rocky Mountains Pressure on regional supplies within the Rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs. Differentials to the Henry Hub have widened to over $0.70 per MMBtu and although prices in the rest of the West will gain some support from high power loads, regional demand in the Rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through August. August demand is expected to average 1.2 Bcf per day in the region, approximately equal to June's 1.1 Bcf per day total demand. Demand begins to build during September, but until the heating season begins in October, Rocky Mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the West. CERA expects a Rocky Mountain-Henry Hub differential of $0.60 per MMBtu during August. Although some narrowing in Rocky Mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall, the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during 2001. CERA expects a supply build this year of nearly 300 MMcf per day, followed by a build of over 350 MMcf per day during 2001. Currently, approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region, with the largest increment on Transcolorado into the San Juan Basin. Next summer, all capacity will likely run close to full. Until export pipelines expand-the first likely expansion is Trailblazer-differentials will remain wide. For 2001, CERA expects an average annual differential below the Henry Hub of $0.65 per MMBtu. Southwest Differentials in the San Juan and Permian Basins have gained considerable strength relative to Henry Hub prices amid the recent hot weather in Texas. Permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price, and in the San Juan Basin prices have narrowed from an early July differential of $0.35 per MMBtu to a differential of less than $0.20 per MMBtu. CERA expects demand in the Southwest during August of 1.4 Bcf per day, an increase from June's level of 1.3 Bcf per day, but the larger Texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins. CERA expects a San Juan differential of $0.30 per MMBtu during August, with a Permian Basin differential of $0.06 per MMBtu. Differentials between the Rocky Mountains and the San Juan Basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the Rocky Mountains. Flows on Transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under 20 MMcf per day to over 100 MMcf per day during June. Supply in the two regions is following opposite paths; Rockies supply is climbing rapidly, and San Juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year. CERA expects a decline in supply of 30 MMcf per day during 2000 relative to 1999 and an additional decline of 150 MMcf per day during 2001. Because of these different outlooks, wider Rockies-San Juan differentials will persist. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables.

Note:  Official results not yet released.   Kern River currently has a project on file for an expansion to be placed in service on 5-1-02 for 124,500 Dth/day at a cost of $80MM. Second Kern River Open Season Successful Williams' Kern River Gas Transmission last week completed an open season for added firm capacity on its pipeline into Nevada and/or California amid rave reviews, although specific details were not yet released by the Salt Lake City-based interstate pipeline. ""The results were outstanding,"" said a Williams spokesperson in Salt Lake City. ""I mean they were huge, but we don't have that many details yet."" The pipeline indicated it should have more information this week. New service resulting from this open season would be available May 1, 2003 for terms of 10 or 15 years, the company said at the time of starting the two-month open season. The capacity dates are geared to coincide with the proposed opening of several new electric generating plants in Nevada and California, and since that date the call for added generation throughout the western states has been reiterated as it was at last Friday's Western Governors' Association energy roundtable in Portland, OR. Although Kern River has ruled out proposing new laterals, it has indicated it planned to help meet the increased gas demand for new power plants by adding compression and looping. The company has intends to finalize expansion design and rate impact analyses following the close of this most recent open season. Another open season last fall was held on an added 124,500 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity into California along Kern's 922-mile interstate pipeline from Wyoming (see Daily GPI, Nov. 16, 2000 <d20001116g.html>). 
Filings: The Ball is in FERC's Court 
Note:  There are a lot of good names and organizations in this article, especially the Economic Development Councils.  Worth spending some time with them? Lorna Wednesday, February 7, 2001 Nevada Goes for the Gold By Dave Todd dtodd@ftenergy.com <mailto:dtodd@ftenergy.com> It's a reverse twist on America's economic history. One might even call it a case of Eastward Ho! For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part of the United States, entrepreneurs are talking about leaving, not moving into, the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east. Not much farther east, only over the mountains into neighboring states, but still in that direction, as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of California. And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from Nevada. Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes ""could be the genesis for industry departures from the state."" The impact on large industrial users, he warned, could ""provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn"" in California, which accounts for about 12% of the United States GDP. California's mass exodus Since the beginning of the year, Nevada's primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state. The bad news for California is that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or ""wannabes"" whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery. Somer Hollingsworth, president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in Las Vegas, said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to Nevada. In meeting with the company he asked, ""Are there others like you? And 
News Briefs: Reliant Energy Plans to Form Two Public Companies Reliant Energy said it plans to file with the Texas Public Utility Commission a business separation plan under which it would divide into two publicly traded companies to separate its unregulated businesses from its regulated businesses. The company plans an initial public offering of approximately 20% of the common stock of its unregulated operations late this year or early in 2001, assuming market conditions remain favorable. The company expects the IPO to be followed by a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the unregulated company within 12 months. The remaining businesses, which are predominately regulated, will be structured as a holding company. The unregulated company will own Reliant Energy's unregulated power generation and related energy trading and marketing operations, its unregulated retail businesses, which currently include energy, telecommunications and internet services, and the company's European electric generating and trading/marketing operations. The plan also contemplates that in 2004 the unregulated company will receive from the regulated company cash equal to the market value of the regulated company's interest in its Texas regulated generation operations. In addition, the unregulated company will have an option to purchase the regulated company's interest in these operations at a price equal to the market value. The regulated company will include Reliant Energy's electricity and natural gas companies, which serve about four million customers in the U.S. and include Reliant Energy HL&P/Entex, Reliant Energy Arkla, Reliant Energy Entex and Reliant Energy Minnegasco. Other operations in the entity will include its U.S. interstate pipelines, its interests in Latin America and, initially, its Texas regulated generation. 
PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) sold out its available short-term firm capacity, the company reported. The pipeline sold nine packages of capacity totaling 282,000 Dth/d to 20 shippers. Terms of each package vary. Results from its recent open season on proposed long-term firm capacity should be out 
FERC Approves Questar Pipeline The FERC has given final approval for a Questar $155 million pipeline project to transport natural gas to southern California from the Four Corners area at the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. The ruling came after the commission was satisfied the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline project would not harm the environment. The project will consist of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline that was bought by Questar in 1998 from Arco. The pipeline will be converted for natural gas and several new compressors will be built. The pipeline would be divided into a East Zone and a West Zone. The East Zone will begin in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and end at the California border and carry up to 88 MMcf per day. The West Zone is within California and has a capacity of 120 MMcf per 
Note the discussion on market share halfway through the article. Top Gas Gorillas Show Strong Volume Growth The year 2000 was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing, with huge increases in gas prices, enormous volatility, continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits. Physical gas sales volumes for the top 20 marketers in NGI's ranking grew 17% to nearly 150 Bcf/d, and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as Williams reporting 2,000% profit increases in their energy merchant segments. However, for many of the smaller players it was a tough year. ""The big news 
FPL Acquires Entergy FPL Group will acquire Entergy for about $6.4 billion in stock in a deal that will create the largest US power company. The news sent FPLs shares lower because of disappointment that FPL was not the takeover target. The combined company will have 6.3 million customers and 48,000 MW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electric service to about 3.8 million customers throughout Florida. Entergy delivers electricity to about 2.5 million customers in parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The deal, a $27 billion merger, which included their combined market value of $16.4 billion, $6.9 billion of Entergy debt and $3.8 billion of FPL debt. FPL shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Entergys 43%. The board of directors will be made up of 8 FPL members and 7 Entergy members. To support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back a total of $1 billion in stock, $570 million in FPL stock and $430 million in Entergy stock. FPL shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of FPLs 170.5 million diluted shares outstanding. Entergy shareholders would receive 0.585 share in the new company for each of their 228.1 million diluted shares outstanding. Shares of FPL fell more than 8%, to 48-1/4 and Entergy shares fell more than 10% to 27-1/4 yesterday afternoon. Based on FPLs price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at about $28.33 per share. Many had speculated FPL was to be bought rather than be involved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $200 million break-up fee in case either side terminates the deal. The merger of FPL and Entergy must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal regulators and was expected to close next year. The combined company expects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPLs current dividend policy. Based on its current annual dividend of $2.16 per share, Entergys shareholders would receive $1.26 per share compared with its current dividend of $1.20 per share. FPLs Broadhead will become the chairman and Entergy Chief Executive Leonard will become chief executive of the new company. The expected annual cost savings and increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businesses may range from $150 million to $275 million, with about half the cost savings to come from work force reductions, mainly through attrition, 
Due to a compressor failure at its Riner Station, Williams declared a force majeure situation on Line Segments 490 and 491. Necessary repairs are expected to be completed by next Monday's gas day. Since capacity in the two segments has been reduced, maintenance originally scheduled for the week of Aug. 21 at the Cheyenne and Ogallah Stations will be done this week to minimize 
Kern River Open Season Kern River is holding an open season through Aug. 18 to determine interest in year-round FT to Nevada and California and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm shippers. The pipeline said it can offer significantly reduced FT rates based on recent FERC approval of Kern River's Extended Term Rate Program (ET Program). Under ET Program, customers could receive a rate reduction from $0.64/Dth to approximately $0.42 under a 15-year contract. Because system expansion can be accomplished by the addition of compression facilities, it could result in an overall lowering of rolled-in rates for all shippers, Kern River said. Depending on open season results, the pipeline is proposing a mainline expansion of up to 500 MMcf/d with an in-service target date of May 1, 2002. If goals can be met using relinquished capacity and no new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as Oct. 1, 2001. Call Laurie Brown at (801) 584-6410 or Greg Snow at -7270 for more information. Panda Links to Transmission Grid for Gila Bend Plant Panda Energy International inked a firm electrical transmission agreement with Arizona Public Service to supply power from its proposed natural gas-fired 2,000 MW plant to be located in the town of Gila Bend. The proposed plant is before the Arizona Corporation Committee for review. Senior vice president of merchant plant development for Panda, Garry Hubbard, said that the firm contract is ""a critical step forward for the plant."" The new plant is on schedule to commence construction later this year, with start up 18 months later, he added. Powering the plant will be eight General Electric 7 FA natural gas turbines operating in combined

FERC Gives High Sign to WI Pipe Competition The northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin gas transportation markets, which long have been dominated by ANR Pipeline, moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline-on-pipeline competition yesterday when FERC awarded the proposed Guardian Pipeline LLC a favorable preliminary determination on non-environmental issues. The decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline because not only did it shoot down most of the arguments presented by ANR to thwart the project, but it found that even though the project would ""adversely 
InterGen Takes 30% Stake in Coral Energy With plans to grow its power generation portfolio in the United States, InterGen, the power generation joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings Inc., closed a deal yesterday giving the international developer a 30% equity interest in Houston-based Coral Energy, one of the largest natural gas and power marketers in the country. Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction giant Bechtel would fold InterGen, InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business (see Daily GPI, July 10). Under the agreement announced yesterday, InterGen will receive the majority of the natural gas pipeline, storage and power generation assets of Shell's Coral Energy affiliate in the United States. It remains a joint venture of Shell and Bechtel. The move gives Shell a 68% ownership in InterGen, with Bechtel owning the remaining 32%. InterGen had been formed as a 50/50 joint venture, and Bechtel made an undisclosed payment to Shell in the deal. About 230 Coral employees, mostly related to the Texas-based assets in Houston, will become InterGen employees under the agreement. InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development, with projects around the world. Carlos Riva, InterGen's CEO, said that the transaction ""represents a significant boost to our plans in the United States. These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier U.S. gas and electricity trading enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the U.S. 
Nymex Moves Gas Opening Bell Up to 9:30 a.m. The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange has amended plans to move up the start-up time for natural gas futures trading because of the overlap with crude oil markets, which share an options ring with natural gas. Daily gas futures trading now will commence at 9:30 a.m. rather than 9:45. The board has scheduled expanded energy trading hours to begin with the Sept. 8 trading session. On July 13, the board voted to expand futures trading hours electronically for its light sweet crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas futures and options markets. It also voted to have an earlier opening for the open outcry session for natural gas futures and options. Beginning at 4 p.m. on Sept. 7 the Nymex Access electronic trading sessions for those commodities will be extended to run from 4 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, to 9 a.m. the following day. On Sundays, the session will begin at 7 p.m. and will run until 9 a.m. on Monday. Currently, the sessions for light sweet crude oil, heating oil and gasoline begin at the same times but close at 8 a.m. Natural gas futures and options currently are traded from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays with 
A hydrostatic test of Line 3201 identified some pipe that must be replaced, El Paso said Thursday, and once that is done the test must be performed again. It estimated the project will extend through Sunday, reducing Bondad Mainline capacity by 180 MMcf/d (normal capacity is 675 MMcf/d) and affecting seven receipt points. With Line 3201 out of service, the 180 MMcf/d loss can not be made up at points downstream of Bondad Mainline, El Paso said. Thus the same (not additional) 180 MMcf/d reduction must be applied at Gallup (NM) Station. PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest said its Internet-based nomination system became operational again Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening power failure caused the server to crash. El Paso will hold meetings Aug. 9 in Houston, Aug. 10 in Los Angeles and Aug. 11 in Phoenix to present details of its Line No. 2000 Project. The project requires FERC approval to abandon certain mainline compressor facilities and replace them with a 30-inch crude oil pipeline upon its conversion to natural gas service. El Paso announced early this year (see Daily GPI, Feb. 4) it was buying part of the All American Pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. and would invest $75 million to convert the segment to a natural gas pipeline. The segment being converted extends 1,088 miles from Emidio, CA, to McCamey, TX. Those planning to attend one of next week's meetings should call Lisa Holmes at 
New Hurricane Forecast out of CSU Renowned hurricane soothsayer Dr. William Gray and his team at Colorado State University have scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the season to be more active than average. Seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three of them are expected to be intense rather than the four expected in the group's prior forecast on June 7. In round numbers, the August forecast is for three named storms, two hurricanes, and one intense or major hurricane. ""Information obtained through July 2000 indicates that the Atlantic hurricane season in 2000 is likely to be less active than the four recent very busy years of 1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999. However, total activity is expected to exceed the long term average and is anticipated to be considerably more active than the mean for the recent period of 1970 through 1994. ""We estimate that the 2000 season will have seven hurricanes (average is 5.7), 11 named storms (average is 9.3), 55 named storm days (average is 47), 30 hurricane days (average is 24), three intense (category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.2), six intense hurricane days (average is 4.7) and a Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) of 90 (average is 71).

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Tue, August 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing: In a High Range Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1314 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/081500_17/nag_alt_081500_17_ab.html ********************************************************************** Gas prices remain within a high range, with prices volatile between approximately $3.75 and $4.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). Prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall, until the uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself. At the lower end of this range--and with oil prices in the upper $20s per barrel or higher--price support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to reactivate industrial demand. Gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions, allowing storage injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter. Above-normal heat in only one or two regions, however, or even the threat of storms in the Gulf of Mexico will pull prices quickly upward. As for the upper boundary, although prices in specific regions such as California and the Northeast may reach above $5.00, an actual storm in the Gulf or more widespread heat than! has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the Henry Hub much above $4.50. Absent tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico, CERA expects prices to settle into the lower portion of this band during September (see Table 1). Although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely to sustain prices through much of August, the seasonal decline in generation demand into September should allow storage injections to increase by 1.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. As a result, CERA expects prices to settle somewhat, averaging $3.95 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub during September. However, the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged: supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter. Any interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward; next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year. Gas Storage--Not Yet Enough Mild weather over much of the United States during July allowed a much-needed recovery in storage injections, with the estimated injection rate increasing by nearly 2.5 Bcf per day from year-earlier levels (see Table 2). This rate was enabled entirely by lower demand, however, and not added supply. The result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during August, the US storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near 350 Bcf. Although the deficit is likely to decline on average during August, it is even more likely to expand again during September, especially should any storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms. Absolute inventories and supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market. Inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from occurring next spring. Should injections continue as expected, inventories would reach approximately 2,750 Bcf by October 31; but reaching even this level, still an all-time low annual maximum inventory, requires some help from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in October. Storage inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season. Regional Markets--Western Disconnects Continue Wide differentials emerged this summer in the West and look likely to persist through September. In Southern California record summer demand levels have pushed pipeline flows to new highs. Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America. In the Rockies supply growth has pushed up pipeline flows out of the region. Power loads should ease somewhat in Southern California, and that easing will bring some decline in the Topock premium. Pressure on Rocky Mountains and San Juan prices should persist until the start of the heating season in late October (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: *  Rockies. Pipeline capacity out of the Rockies is running nearly full to every export market except the San Juan Basin. Emerging pipeline bottlenecks should keep differentials wide during September, with an average differential of $0.75 per MMBtu. *  San Juan. In the San Juan increased imports from the Rocky Mountains and high utilization rates on capacity into California are pressuring prices. CERA expects differentials to average $0.55 per MMBtu for the month of September. San Juan differentials will narrow more substantially when Rocky Mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand during the fourth quarter. *  Permian and Mid-Continent. Strong power loads in Texas have supported Permian Basin prices during July and August. Persistent power demand is expected to keep differentials around $0.08 per MMBtu for September. Mid-Continent prices should average just under Permian prices. *  Chicago. Steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at Chicago in the face of declining power generation into September. July premiums of $0.06 to $0.07 have already come down in early August and are likely to remain low, at approximately $0.03 for September. *  Northeast markets. Northeast price premiums have averaged from the mid-$0.20s to the mid-$0.30s, depending on generation load and proximity to the New York Facilities Group major meters. CERA expects little to change this relationship, but as generation loads decline into September, premiums could move closer to the fuel cost floor, the mid- to high $0.20s. Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Disappointing Although June displayed year-over-year growth in production in western Canada, July reverted to a decline, and August is running close to last year's level. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in 2000, approximately 9,200 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is expected to produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western Canadian supply build is expected to be flat with 1999, increasing to a positive growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are down 275 MMcf per day on average for 2000 but have been down by over 350 MMcf per day so far in the third quarter. PG&E GT-NW volumes were up by over 300 MMcf per day in June and July but have dropped to year-earlier levels in August and are expected to remain close to last year's levels for September. Northern Border Pipeline is operating at rates similar to last year's on average in 2000 but is expected to decrease about 50 MMcf per day for the third quarter. Western Canadian demand is currently up slightly, driven by the warmer-than-normal weather in late July and early August, but should be closer to 1999 levels in September. High Prices: Wide Differentials The AECO-Henry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few months from the low US$0.30s of the first quarter to US$0.84 in July. The differential increased to well over a dollar in the second week of August, but the driver for that increase was maintenance that reduced the export capacity at Empress. August and September are expected to average in the mid-$0.80s. AECO is expected to average C$4.67 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.35 per MMBtu) for August, with September softening to C$4.53 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu) for a third quarter average of C$4.54 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables. ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

New Xcel Energy Combination Completed Just 17 months after announcement of merger plans, Minneapolis-based Northern States Power and Denver-based New Century Energies have cleared the last hurdle to combine under the new name Xcel Energy Inc. The merger creates one of the 10 largest electricity and natural gas companies in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued its approval of the merger, wrapping up approvals from several federal agencies and states where the companies operate. Xcel Energy will serve more than 3 million electricity and 1.5 million natural gas customers in 12 states, and 2 million electricity customers internationally. Company headquarters will be in Minneapolis. Gradually, the NSP and NCE names will be phased out as Xcel Energy provides enhanced products and services in 12 states, including parts of Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, under the symbol XEL. Current New Century Energies shareholders will receive 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy stock for each share of NCE they hold. NSP shareholders will get one for one and will not be required to exchange their existing NSP stock. The merger proposal was announced March 25, 1999, and completed in less than a year and a half. ""This has been an incredibly successful merger process,"" said Jim Howard, Xcel chairman. ""It demonstrates what can be accomplished when regulators, environmentalists, community leaders and the merger partners all work in a common direction --- to create a better utility company for the

El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers, maximum storage withdrawals, an OFO and other customer cooperation. The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points rose by about 35 cents to lead an overall price surge. However, utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems. SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems. A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power also saw no reason for panic. From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines, he expected that the approximately 80-feet-long section missing from El Paso's line could be ""slapped back into place rather 
Note:  This text was released today by Natural Gas Intelligence after an interview with Alliance personnel Construction Completed on Alliance Pipeline The C$4.6 billion Alliance natural gas and liquids pipeline, designed to transport 1.325 Bcf/d from northeast British Columbia to Chicago, has completed its construction phase and now is commissioning the main line, laterals, compressors and supervisory equipment. The final weld was completed last week near Regina, SK, and Alliance now is injecting linepack. The 1,857 mile mainline is stretched to the Chicago area from northeastern BC. October is still the target month to begin service of the pipeline, which will carry both natural gas and liquids. The pipeline system will transport natural gas through a 36-inch diameter high-pressure line. There will be 14 mainline compressor stations: seven in Canada and seven in the U.S. When it began construction in 1999, Alliance already had commitments from 37 shippers for 15-year contracts worth a total of $8.2 billion. The large volumes of gas Alliance will haul from western Canada into the U.S. Midwest is expected to have a major impact on existing pipelines, markets and prices. TransCanada PipeLines already has filed for new tolls to compensate for customers which have failed to renew firm contracts on its line and instead are routing their gas through Alliance. New gas that makes its way into the Chicago area could be sent on to southern Ontario through the Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline, scheduled to open in late October with intial capacity of 720 Bcf/d.  The Foothills/Northern Border route from western Canada into the Midwest also is expected to see some slack. Alliance spokesman Jay Godfrey said last month that ""when October comes we won't be in the position that we'll have to start filling the pipe. It essentially already is going to be full."" Connections to 37 gas plants are already complete. Investors in Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnerships include affiliates of Coastal (14.4%), Enbridge (21.4%), Fort Chicago Energy Partners LP (26%), Williams (14.6%) and Westcoast Energy (23.6%).

September Forecast 
Alert ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Tue, August 22, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing: A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices Author: Zenker, Snyder, Moritzburke E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1320 , Alternate URL: http://www.cera.com/client/ce/alt/082200_18/ce_alt_082200_18_ab.html ********************************************************************** As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices for both power and natural gas, September looms as the start of the fall shoulder season. The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels. CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past, however, with power and gas markets producing strong year-over-year prices and little relief from summer levels, even with normal September weather. West-wide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June, a month with high power prices. In addition, compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows, leaving more expensive gas-fired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output. CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push on-peak prices in the West to 244 percent over September 1999 levels. Continued strong use of gas-fired generation in the West, as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances, will keep the pressure on gas prices. Topock prices are expected to average $4.45 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in September. These high September gas and power prices are driven by * Declining hydroelectric output. The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West, with rainfall historically boosting output in December. Approximately 16,400 average megawatts (aMW) will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the three-month period. This represents a net reduction in capacity of 6,900 aMW when compared with the recent June-August summer months and a reduction of 3,600 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels. * Higher, more variable power demand. The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September, and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a year's peak load event will occur in September. Spiking loads, however, can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather. Thus, power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September. * High levels of gas-fired generation. Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gas-fired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June 2000, a month with similar average demand and monthly average on-peak power prices in the $150-$178 per megawatt-hour (MWh) range, depending on the region. This strong pull on gas-fired plants will push deep into the generation resource base, driving prices upward. An additional 1.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day will be required for gas-fired generators in the US West compared with September 1999 levels. * Strong North American gas prices. Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summer's peak levels, as North American supplies remain tight. A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall. As a result, average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around $3.95 per MMBtu. An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the $4.50 mark. * Strong western basis differentials. The strong demand for gas to serve gas-fired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels, especially in the California markets. CERA expects a Topock-to-Henry Hub differential of $0.40 per MMBtu during September. Extended operational problems associated with El Paso's pipeline rupture would raise that outlook. Regional Power Market Drivers Hotter-than-normal August weather, transmission and generator outages, high natural gas prices, and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August. Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of $90 per MWh during the on-peak period and by $14 per MWh during the off-peak period. Mid-Columbia power prices, bearing the brunt of fire-induced transmission outages, experienced a jump from July price levels of $114 per MWh for the on-peak period and $20 per MWh in the off-peak period. Off-peak prices, which have averaged above $60 per MWh during the June-August period, are clearly defined by the production cost of gas-fired resources. On-peak prices during this same period, at over $100 per MWh in all regions in all months, have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator (see Table 1). A return to normal weather should drive West-wide loads down by 8,300 aMW in September from August levels. However, load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by 5,400 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels. These greater loads, coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of 3,600 aMW from last September's levels, will create supply tightness during September (see Tables 2 and 3). Hydroelectric, coal, and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve West-wide demand in September, even during much of the off-peak periods, requiring gas-fired resources to meet a significant portion of the load. Gas demand for power generation is expected to average 5.2 Bcf per day in September, down from over 5.9 Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic 1.7 Bcf per day compared with levels in September 1999. September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gas-fired generation, approximately $50 per MWh, with prices frequently higher as demand increases. As this summer has clearly demonstrated, prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight. Hot weather-induced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship. * Cooler- or hotter-than-normal weather in September, coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads, will produce a wide range of price outcomes. Under normal weather, on-peak power prices are expected to fall in the $113-$123 per MWh range, depending on location, representing a 244 percent premium to year-ago September prices (see Figure 1). The latest revision of the California Independent System Operator's (ISO's) imbalance energy market cap down to $250 per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September. CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well. Pacific Northwest Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least 1,100 aMW compared with those in the hotter-than-normal month of August, the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to 1,900 aMW over the same period (see Table 4). Thus, the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions. With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period, power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California. These price levels will continue to support the operation of the region's limited quantity of gas-fired generation. Mid-Columbia on-peak price levels are expected to average $118 per MWh in September. Off-peak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south. The expected September level of $54 per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets. California The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path 15 and those to the south. As in years past, hydro-depleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region. Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle, and energy from the nuclear and coal-rich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path 15 import limitations. This condition, which is expected to persist from September through November, allows Northern California to price at a premium. The expected monthly average on-peak Northern California price of $123 per MWh incorporates this dynamic. Notably, the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California, in part to capture locational price differences more effectively. Southern California, like the Southwest, will typically experience hot weather episodes in September. During these high demand periods, prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer. In addition, California as a whole should see average loads in September that are 4,600 aMW higher than those of September 1999. Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices. Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region, allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California. An $8 per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected, with Southern California on-peak prices averaging $115 per MWh. Off-peak prices of $53 and $47 per MWh for Northern and Southern California, respectively, reflect the continued need for gas-fired resources to support September off-peak loads. Rockies and Southwest An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies, a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning. Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West. A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North. Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads, with a September monthly on-peak price average of $113 per MWh and an off-peak price average of $43 per MWh. CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis. The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns, and a strong 7,600 MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other. Strong gas prices and occasional market tightness-induced price run-ups will maintain on-peak prices at the $115 per MWh level in September. Off-peak prices will, like those in Southern California, be buoyed by the high cost of gas-fired generation. A price level of $47 per MWh is expected for off-peak prices. Regional Gas Market Drivers The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America, with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition. Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States, the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile. The storage deficit now stands at approximately 350 Bcf, and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels. This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September. CERA expects a Henry Hub price of $3.95 per MMBtu during September. In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September, especially in California. Overall, total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from 10.1 Bcf per day during August to 9.8 Bcf per day during September (see Table 5). This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month. The recent price disconnects between the supply-rich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demand-charged California will persist. October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase. In general, winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West. The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads. Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan. On the other hand, healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season. The start-up of the new Alliance pipeline, which will draw gas to the Midwest, will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California. California Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America, although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near $1.00 per MMBtu before this weekend's pipeline explosion. Total imports into California reached record levels during July; total imports of 5.8 Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day (see Table 6). Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at 83 percent utilization. So far in August, pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate, running at 85 percent. These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California, and the pressure should continue during September. Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September, but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support. Total demand in the state should average 6.6 Bcf per day, down only slightly from August's total of 6.8 Bcf per day. Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly, but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand. The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately $0.50 per MMBtu for September (see Table 7). Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States, but the storage surplus in the region has eroded. In California, inventories are running lower than last year, and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September. The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes. Pacific Northwest Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown. So far this month, prices at Malin are averaging a $0.25 per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub. Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full; flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly 2.2 Bcf per day this month. Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity, and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide Malin-to-Topock differentials. Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong, and the wide north-south differentials within the West will likely hold through September. In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to 1.5 Bcf per day from 1.4 Bcf per day in August. This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels. For September CERA expects Malin prices to average $0.10 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand. Although the westward pull on supplies is strong, bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices. Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached 93 percent during July, with less than 200 MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity. Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply, and in general, the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin. Unlike in the past two summers, the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices. The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged $0.50 per MMBtu so far this month and $0.30 per MMBtu since June. Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by 200 MMcf per day relative to last summer, but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect. Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand, the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September. The San Juan-to-Henry Hub differential is expected to average $0.60 per MMBtu. As in the Rockies, differentials should narrow substantially in October. Rocky Mountains Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb. Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region; generation is still largely coal-based, and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal. CERA expects the heavy discount-current Rocky Mountain-to-Henry Hub differentials are around $0.90 per MMBtu-to persist through September. Local area demand is not expected to change during September. Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads; October demand should average 1.4 Bcf per day, up from August and September averages of around 1.2 Bcf per day. Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies, winter differentials are expected to stay in the $0.25 to $0.40 per MMBtu range. Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer. Next summer, pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer. Although pipeline expansion projects have been announced-Trailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summer-the new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer. CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by 300 MMcf per day next year. Western Canada After widening to over US$1.50 per MMBtu, the AECO-Henry differential has begun to narrow somewhat; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from $0.84 per MMBtu in July. With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow, differentials are likely to persist in the mid-US$0.70s per MMBtu for September. AECO is expected to be US$3.25 per MMBtu (C$4.53 per gigajoule) for September. Even with the start-up of the Alliance project, the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the two-tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs. This will result in differentials that will range between US$0.60 and US$0.75 per MMBtu throughout the winter. Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last year's levels. The pace of drilling (over 9,000 gas wells are expected this year) should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001. Supply is expected to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Sumas prices have been quite volatile, driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system. For September, Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US$0.05 per MMBtu. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

El Paso South Mainline Shut-in Extended The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) has ordered all three of the pipes comprising El Paso Natural Gas' 1 Bcf/d South Mainline from Texas to California to remain closed until extensive tests can be done to ensure they are safe to operate. The order came in the wake of Saturday's explosion and fire that ripped through one of those lines, the 30-inch pipeline 1103, at a Pecos River crossing near Carlsbad, NM, killing 11 people. Because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of pipeline, OPS is directing El Paso to submit a corrective action plan for OPS approval that will identify all areas on approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may be subject to internal corrosion,"" said Kelley S. Coyner, head of the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for the OPS, in a prepared statement. The DOT ""is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the vicinity of Pecos River remain closed until such time that the department has determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate."" This is necessary to ""protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure 
Aquila Signs Long-Term Deal with APEA Aquila Energy said it has been awarded a $550 million long-term contract to supply 154 Bcf of natural gas over 12 years to members of the American Public Energy Agency (APEA). It is the fourth contract the agency has awarded to Aquila since 1998. ""With the future of gas prices becoming more and more unknown because of increasing demands and tightening supply, our members will benefit greatly from this long-term contract,"" said Roger Mock, president and chief executive officer of APEA. Under the three previous contracts with APEA Aquila is supplying the agency with 14.4 Bcf of gas over ten years, 91 Bcf over 12 years and 141 Bcf over 12 years. All together, Aquila is providing APEA with more than 400 Bcf over the next 12 years. APEA provides a reliable supply of natural gas to many municipal utilities and other public entities throughout the United States. These public buyers serve thousands of homes and businesses. ""Our strategy is to provide our customers with the most effective portfolio of services, both financially and physically, to enhance their competitive position in managing their energy needs,"" said Tom McCarthy, vice president of structured transactions for Aquila Energy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Devon Energy and Santa Fe Snyder completed their $2.5 billion merger yesterday as shareholders of both companies approved the deal, which was announced in May. The agreement called for each Santa Fe Snyder common share to be converted into 0.22 shares of Devon common stock. Conversion requires issuance of 40.6 million additional Devon common shares, resulting in total shares outstanding of 127.7 million. Former Santa Fe Snyder shareholders now own 32% of the combined company. Historical Devon shareholders own 68% of the combined company. The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. With merger completion, Devon now ranks among the top five U.S.-based independent oil and gas producers in terms of market capitalization, total proved reserves and annual production. The company has an enterprise value of $9 billion and proved reserves of 1.1 billion boe. The company expects to realize $30 million to $35 million in annual cost savings from the merger. Devon was added to the S&P 500 Index after the close of 
Note:  This article gives some of the strategy and economics of the purchase of Montana Power by Pan Canadian. We will look at the Oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our pipe--with the switch in ownership, they may be receptive to strategy changes. Lorna PanCanadian Says Montana Power Purchase 'Beautiful Fit' To extend what it sees as dominance in Canada's natural gas market and to boost its production by 10%, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. yesterday agreed to purchase Montana Power Co. for $475 million. The properties will extend PanCanadian's existing shallow gas properties in southern Alberta into northern Montana, adding 94 MMcf/d and 3,800 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids. The acquisition will give PanCanadian properties in Alberta, Montana, Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming, along with three gas pipelines linking Alberta and Saskatchewan to Montana. ""We have a focus on natural gas,"" said CEO David Tuer during a conference call yesterday in Calgary. ""This is clearly our future. It is difficult to put any negative on this (acquisition) and it's likely to stay valuable for

El Paso South System Flows 700 MMcf/d Less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system in southeastern New Mexico, the pipeline last week had more than 700 MMcf/d of its 1.1 Bcf/d capacity restored to its South Mainline that services markets between Texas and California. At mid-day Friday, El Paso said it began running about 260 MMcf/d through Line 1100 after it received the go-ahead from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), according to spokeswoman Kim Wallace. El Paso was able to re-start partial service on the 26-inch line after it built a 16-inch temporary connector line between Line 1110 and Line 1100, which was approved by OPS. The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion site, about 30 miles from Carlsbad, NM. Wallace said Line 1100 would carry the gas from Eunice, NM, just Northeast of the Pecos River Compressor Station, to the connector with Line 1110, which then would transport it westward across the Pecos River Bridge where it would meet up with Line 1100 further downstream. Meanwhile, Wallace said El Paso submitted to OPS last week the test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line 1100. Three days prior, the OPS had given El Paso permission to restore service to Line 1110 from the Keystone Station through the Pecos River Compressor Station at a reduced level. The pipeline re-opened the line at about 400 MMcf/d, and gradually increased it to 480 MMcf/d by Friday. This is ""still within the limits it [OPS] set"" for Line 1110, Wallace said. The OPS restricted El Paso's Line 1110 to 80% of the operating pressure of Line 1103 at the time it ruptured, according to Department of Transportation spokeswoman Debbie Hinz. She said this put the line at a pressure of about 538 pounds per square inch. The OPS-ordered shutdown of Line 1110 lasted 10 days, during which the agency ordered El Paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic, ultrasound and X-ray tests to determine its safety, and to submit a plan for restoring service to the line. As for the future of ruptured Line 1103, Wallace said repairs on it would not begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed, which will 
Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
Texans Bake as Electricity Usage Hits Record By today, a ""cool"" spell was expected to grip Texas, plunging temperatures down to around 100. A nice respite from the 105-plus temperatures that stilled the state and sent electricity peak loads to new records last week for the third time this year. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an industry coalition that administers the state's power grid and serves 85% of the state's electric load, reported Friday that preliminary numbers indicated that electricity usage reached an all-time peak high for the third time in 44 days last Thursday, with Texans using 57,731 MW of power. Of course, that was before the weekend, when temperatures were expected to climb as high as 112 at some locations in the state --- just in time for Labor Day picnics. The new usage record last Thursday broke the previous record set the day before, on Wednesday, when consumers used 55,994 MW of power. The two broken records broke a record set just six weeks earlier, July 19, when Texans used 55,796 MW of power. Peak load in August 1999 was 54,849 MW of power, while peak load in August

Prudential Sees Bull Market Running Two More Years With gas futures prices soaring past $5, now is not a bad time to raise price forecasts and expectations for the coming winter and next year. Prudential Securities did just that yesterday, upping its predictions on spot wellhead prices to $4.10 for the second half of the year, $3.55 for all of 2000 and $3.65 for 2001. ""[W]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a 'lay up,'"" the investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas fundamentals. Below average storage inventories and increasing gas-fired electric generation demand should keep the bull market running, the report stated. Prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 Bcf, or 11% below last year's level. ""This is assuming that the average injection rate is at or above the eight-year historical average during that period, and so far this year refills have been at or below the historical average. Depending on the winter weather, the industry typically consumes 2,000-2,500 Bcf out of storage inventories, which would likely bring storage levels down 
EIA Predicts Supply Shortfall Will Linger Through Winter The Energy Information Administration said yesterday in its September Short-Term Energy Outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead will increase by about 87% this winter (October-March) compared to last winter. Residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27% compared to last year. For the entire year, the average wellhead price for natural gas is projected to be $3.40/Mcf, the highest annual wellhead price on record (in inflation-adjusted terms, it would be the highest annual average price since 1985). The short-term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry's ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are likely to continue into the heating season, EIA said. Storage levels could end up being about 8% below the five-year average of about 3,000 Bcf by the start of winter if net injections continue at 10% below historically average rates through the remainder of the refill season. The effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the form of significantly increased production until after the next heating season, according to the agency's report. ""For now, we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001, with assumed increases of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, for this year and next...,"" the EIA report stated. ""On the other hand, the U.S. natural gas rig count on Aug. 25 was at a recent high of 794 rigs. Exploration and production budgets for many natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001, spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues from producing assets. Also on the positive side, data from the Texas Railroad Commission suggest that, through May, year 2000 gas production increased, if only slightly (0.4%). This signifies a turnaround (however modest) in a key producing region. Very high gas drilling rates, including a record-setting pace in deep offshore Gulf of Mexico, confirm that 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Thu, June 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1230 , Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market, as three factors-increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound-call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. As strong as gas market fundamentals are, gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years.  In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer-with pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise-and gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use demand. The $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) increase in gas prices since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users. First, gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the East Coast, and gas will likely lose approximately 600 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer. Second, several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down. Equally telling, however, is that heat in any one region of the country-most recently the West-is all that is required to sustain gas prices above $4.00 at the Henry Hub, despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets. Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive. For these reasons CERA expects prices to average $4.45 at the Henry Hub during July (see Table 1), and even greater volatility is ! possible. The intense competition and need to price out end-use demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above $5.00 per MMBtu amid heat waves this summer. Gas Storage-Injections Increase, but Little Relief Yet The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages, with the American Gas Association (AGA) reporting 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of injections during each of the weeks ending June 2 and 9. However, these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to 400 Bcf on a year-over-year basis, and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks, or even months, to come. As temperatures rise through the end of the month, injections are likely to slow, so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of approximately 10 Bcf per day. The deficit that stood at an estimated 394 Bcf as of the end of May (see Table 2), on an inventory level of approximately 1,454 Bcf, is expected to rise slightly during June, to 403 Bcf, despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month. With US wellhead supply still running an estimated 0.5 to 1.0 Bcf per day below year-earlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting this decline, even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task. Each month in which this 400 Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October. Injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this pattern to reverse in a significant way, an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions. Regional Markets With the exception of the Rocky Mountains, western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region. This strong demand is pulling supplies from the Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California. Prices at the California border have been particularly strong, averaging over a $0.30 premium to the Henry Hub so far this month. Continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through July, as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines. In addition, the early heat waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus, although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: *  Rockies. Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region. High utilization rates on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer. CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry Hub of $0.55 per MMBtu. *  San Juan. The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub, and this West Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer. CERA expects a differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of $0.16 per MMBtu during July. *  Permian and Mid-Continent. As Texas power loads increase, the competition from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify. Permian differentials, which have been averaging around $0.15 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub, should narrow. CERA expects a $0.06 per MMBtu differential for July. Mid-Continent supplies should price just below Permian supplies, at an $0.08 per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub. *  Chicago. Chicago differentials continue to trade around $0.05 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub, and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials, ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure. CERA expects a July differential of $0.06 per MMBtu. *  Northeast. New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer, namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of $4.00 gas. The result has been differentials above $0.30 from Transco Station 65 but closer to $0.30 from the Henry Hub. As power generation load reaches its peak, however, differentials can rise even in summer. Short-lived power load peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the $0.40s, but for the month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average $0.34. Canadian Markets-Demand Still Down Canadian demand continues to be down on a year-over-year basis. Volumes on TransCanada Pipeline are 400 MMcf below levels at this time last year, and Alberta demand is 200 MMcf below; both of these reductions are primarily storage related. Weak storage injections, driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summer-winter price spread, continue to place inventories further behind 1999 levels. Although inventories are still well above the five-year average, unless injections increase, it is more likely that end-of-season inventories will be comparable to the five-year average (450 Bcf) rather than to 1999 levels (484 Bcf). Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year. Thus far in June, flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to 1999, while PG&E GT-NW is currently operating 300 MMcf higher. Demand on the West Coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer. Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with 1999 levels. An outage pattern similar to last year's has emerged. TCE/NOVA has had maintenance projects ongoing in June, but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds. Thus far in June, reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as 850 MMcf but should average 300 MMcf for the month. Even though June is expected to be flat year-over-year, the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than 1999 maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred. Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year, largely in the fourth quarter, as a result of the increased level of drilling. The annual average supply is expected to be around 100 MMcf per day higher than in 1999 as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and modest growth in British Columbia (again primarily later in the year), as well as the new production from! Ft. Liard that is now onstream. The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada. AECO is expected to average C$5.15 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.69 per MMBtu) for June with a differential in the low US$0.60s. July is expected to average C$5.44 per GJ (US$3.90 per MMBtu). The Henry-to-AECO differential is likely to remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand.

Northern Natural Gas declared a force majeure after discovering a leak in its 20-inch Plymouth to Mitchell line in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. Teams isolated the leak, NNG said Wednesday, and the approximate downtime was expected to be two days. Flow was scheduled to zero at the Shell Tippett, Burlington, Marathon Yates and Southern Union receipt points. El Paso reported raising maximum flow through Pecos River Station, near the site of a pipeline explosion Aug. 19, from 700 MMcf/d to 750 MMcf/d effective on Wednesday's business day. El Paso will continue to evaluate the available throughput level while operating under the federal Department of Transportation's Corrective Action Order on allowable pressures in the Pecos

American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Watch Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1235 , Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the development of spot markets. **end** Follow URL for complete report.

Predictions of Fuel Switching 
High Prices Put a Damper on Industrial Demand Gas producers must be wringing their hands in glee as futures prices top $4.45/MMBtu, but some of their customers clearly are a little less than overjoyed. High gas prices are forcing some fertilizer producers to consider shutting down their plants and selling their feedstock on the open market just to make ends meet. WEFA Inc. energy analyst Ron Denhardt estimates the gas industry will lose 25% (400 MMcf/d) of demand from the ammonia and urea industry this year because of the high price of natural gas. Other observers are expecting much larger losses, reaching as high as 1.5 Bcf/d. Denhardt also estimates the loss of an additional 1-2 Bcf/d due to fuel switching in the power production sector and possibly another 2.2 Bcf/d as industrial end users switch over to fuel oil. But those numbers are dependent on the comparative price of Nos. 1 and 2 fuel oil, both of which currently exceed the price of natural gas per Btu. ""Chemical and fertilizer companies who have hedged their gas supplies are better off shutting down their plants right now and selling the gas into the market,"" said one chemical plant supply manager, who asked to remain anonymous. ""It's terrible. It's awful. About 70% of my contracts for sale are pass-through based on the cost of raw materials, and that's the only thing that is keeping me in business right now. We would not be making cost right now otherwise. We might be at a break-even point. And we hedged about 40% of our purchases back in September of last year, which was a pretty good time, looking back right now. We just have to plan it day by day. A number of fertilizer companies have closed 
El Paso Open Season Was 'Rigged,' CPUC Says Armed with a ""smoking gun"" discovered in just-released data, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has launched a fresh offensive against El Paso Natural Gas' 1.22 Bcf/d transportation contract arrangement with affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. Based on information uncovered in an internal e-mail, the CPUC now contends that the open season last February for one third of El Paso's firm transportation capacity was ""rigged"" to show preference to El Paso Merchant. The e-mail revealed that during the open season El Paso Merchant had ""secretly negotiated"" a two cents/MMBtu transportation discount rate on Mojave Pipeline, another El Paso affiliate, for service from Topock to Southern California Gas at Wheeler Ridge for quantities above 100,000 MMBtu/d effective March 1, 2000, the CPUC told FERC. The interruptible discount would last the entire 15 months of the new contracts offered in El Paso Natural Gas' open season, state regulators said, adding that Mojave had withheld announcing the discount until Feb. 18 --- after El Paso's open season had ended. The discounted capacity on Mojave was critical, given that FERC previously had ruled that about half of the 1.22 Bcf/d El Paso capacity (Block II capacity) could not directly access the SoCal-Topock delivery point. As a way around this restriction, bidders in the El Paso open season knew they could use El Paso capacity to access Mojave Pipeline at Topock, and then have their gas shipped to SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, the CPUC said. But what they didn't know was that Mojave had negotiated a discount with El Paso Merchant, the commission noted. The shippers were operating under the assumption that the IT rate still was four cents/MMBtu, which it had been for the previous 18 months. The information about the discount was disclosed in a Feb. 9 e-mail written by El Paso Merchant Vice President Robin Cox, which acknowledged that ""Mojave is willing to offer"" a two cent/MMBtu discount rate for volumes above 100,000 MMBtu/d. ""I will not officially request this discount until next Wednesday assuming we win the capacity,"" the executive wrote. ""After it is posted, it 
Note:  Alliance announced an October 30 official in-service date for tariff services; however, they will be selling test gas in ramp up period.  Right now, these first deliveries are going into the ANR system because it is the only interconnect that is ready. Alliance Delayed, But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up After months of speculation in the industry, Alliance Pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct. 30. When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago, Oct. 2 was the target date for commercial service. However, the delay doesn't mean the market won't be getting any Canadian gas out of Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling 50-100 MMcf/d of gas into the market. It intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full 1.325 Bcf/d load prior to switching to commercial service on Oct. 30, said spokesman Jack Crawford. ""We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas. Right now I think we are dealing with three or four different marketers. Our initial deliveries right now are into the ANR system. That's because its basically the only connection that is ready, but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all. ""I'd be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases of 100 MMcf/d each week] but that's kind of the game plan,"" said Crawford. ""On Oct. 29 it will be Alliance selling [1.325 Bcf/d of] test gas, and on Oct. 30 it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other. The market may not see much of a difference. We obviously don't want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked 
Locations 
El Paso, Coastal Consolidate Pipeline Staff El Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said. The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II. Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern region headquartered in Birmingham, AL. John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J. Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C. Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James Yardley will report to Somerhalder. ""This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's pipeline system,"" said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. ""Our upcoming merger with Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation, border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, September 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: CERA Monthly Briefing: Supply Anxiety Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=3D5526&m=3D1357 , Alternative URL:=20 http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/091500_16/nag_alt_091500_16_ab.html ********************************************************* As the heating season approaches, a high=01*but justified=01*level of anxie= ty regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market. As things stand, the= =20 market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter= =20 even under normal weather conditions. This prospect has placed a floor on the ga= s price at the price of residual fuel oil, itself priced in the mid- to upper= =20 $4.00s range. Gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market, diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply=20 concerns again. To the upside, there is little demand response to price until=20 industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil, as of this writing near $7.0= 0=20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), is breached. However, distillate=20 markets themselves are extremely tight, and prices for that fuel would likely follo= w=20 gas prices up. Within this range, prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety= =01*the market=01,s judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall, which would b= e characterized by extreme pricing and volatility, and a difficult process of= =20 supply allocation by price. By now, exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain. Althou= gh CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately 2.0 billion cu= bic feet (Bcf) per day from August to September, this increase would still leav= e inventories at record lows for this month and next. Even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms, or if hot weather returns. For October, heating load enters the picture. With US supplies running clos= e=20 to year-earlier levels and imports slightly higher, demand priced out of the= =20 market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from las= t=20 year=01,s low level. As a result, although prices may close the month of September in= =20 the upper $4.00s per MMBtu, at the high end of the competitive range with resid= , any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward=20 during the remainder of September or in October. As the heating season begins, therefore, CERA expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter = to result in the first ever monthly average price of $5.00 at the Henry Hub (s= ee Table 1) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price. Gas Storage=01*New Record Lows CERA estimates that storage inventories in the United States crossed into= =20 record low territory as of the end of August, when inventories of 2,233 Bcf fell= =20 below the previous 1996 record low of 2,245 Bcf (see Table 2). More records will likely be broken in the coming months, and by widening margins. Injections = for September are expected to average 9.5 Bcf per day, an increase of 2.0 Bcf p= er day from the August level but below last year=01,s pace of 10.3 Bcf per day= . CERA=01,s September estimate could be exceeded under mild weather condition= s with no tropical activity hitting the Gulf of Mexico, but injections would= =20 likely fall below the 9.5 Bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation = of platforms. This rate would leave US inventories at 2,518 Bcf at month=01,s = end, a record low by 87 Bcf. For October, CERA expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last= =20 year. Injections of 5.5 Bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema= nd priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropica= l storm activity. October injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf pe= r=20 day (1989) to 8.5 Bcf per day (1998). Even if injections reached toward the upp= er end of this range, the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter. At the expected injection rate, US inventories of 2,689 Bcf at the= =20 end of October would result in an end of March 2001 inventory level of 669 Bcf und= er normal winter weather, 89 Bcf below the previous record low of 758 Bcf. Regional Markets=01*Waiting for Winter The pipeline explosion on El Paso during late August intensified the=20 subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets. Cuts in pipeline flows=20 limited access into California on the only pipeline route into the state with any= =20 excess capacity. The lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the California market. Although summer power loads in California will ease and much of the El Paso capacity has be= en restored, the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter= =20 heating load will keep intense pressure on Topock prices. Differentials in the rest= =20 of the West will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t= o ease pipeline bottlenecks (see Table 3). Differentials in the East, which have traded in a narrow range this summer,= =20 will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in= =20 October. However, exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this= =20 year. CERA=01,s outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during October. CERA expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity, differentials will narrow. October differentials should average $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. The resumption of flows on El Paso=01,s southern system, combined with production outages, has relieved some of the access constraints on San Juan supply. Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow October differentials to $0.35 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. The continuing pull on supplies from the West will support Permian prices, and the Midwestern pull on supplies will support Mid-Continent prices. CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of $0.06 per MMBtu for Mid-Continent supplies and $0.11 per MMBtu for Permian supplies. * Chicago. The delay in the in-service date for Alliance from October 2 to October 30 will take some gas out of the Chicago market next month. This delay, combined with the need to build Midwest storage inventories, should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the $0.05=01)$0.08 range to above $0.10 per MMBtu. CERA expects October differentials at the Chicago citygate to average $0.11. * Northeast markets. Gas prices near $5.00 have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast, raising the floor level for differentials to near $0.30 per MMBtu. The beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should support differentials above the floor during October, at near $0.40 per MMBtu. Canadian Markets=01*Outages Affect Supply Outages have affected supply thus far in September. Both British Columbia a= nd Alberta have been affected, resulting in a further year-over-year decline i= n Western Canadian supply. The various problems appear to be rectified, but t= he average supply for the month is likely to be down 100 to 150 million cubic= =20 feet (MMcf) per day from September 1999. Drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet=20 weather, but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels. More th= an 8,400 gas wells are expected for this year. Slight Drop in Export Demand Eastern Canadian demand is still down approximately 200 MMcf per day, with cooler-than-normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning. In the W= est however, cooler-than-normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand for heating requirements of about 200 MMcf per day. Exports are down slightly in September compared with September 1999, with PG&E GT-NW off 110 MMcf per day. Northern Border is running even with September 1999. Storage Picture Brighter in Canada Storage injections in eastern Canada have picked up, with inventories now expected to reach the five-year average of 210 Bcf. In the West, inventorie= s=20 at the end of the injection season will not only be above the five-year level = but should be even with those of 1999, at 250 Bcf. Wider Differentials Holding After widening substantially in August to US$1.17, the AECO-to-Henry differential has closed back to a more typical level of $0.60 in September.

Olympian Status for U.S. Gas Market Just so you'll know: ""The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across dozens of products.

Note:  Ken Lay's comments at the ""Governors' Natural Gas Summit:  Responding to the Growing Energy Crisis"" are quoted in this article. Industry Fears Consumer Backlash Because of High Prices The natural gas industry should be prepared to face customer revolts and attempts at price caps, similar to those witnessed this summer in San Diego if it's a cold winter and prices continue to hit new highs. That was the warning from government and industry representatives at the crisis conference held by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) yesterday. Representatives of producing states and industry speakers were unanimous in opposing government intervention to restrain prices, but no one had a ready remedy for consumer reaction if they are hit with a double whammy of greater energy use at higher prices this winter. One speaker offered a bright spot: the industry might emerge relatively unscathed if the winter is moderate. But then he added it's not just residential heating bills, but electric bills as well that will be impacted by higher natural gas prices. Others pointed out that demand and higher prices could spur lawmakers to open more areas to drilling and encourage new long lines. ""Industrial customers have been dealing with high prices for some time, but higher bills for residential and small commercial customers are just starting to hit the radar screen,"" Peggy Claytor, purchasing manager for steel-maker The Timken Co., told the group of more than 300 from the U.S., Canada and Mexico, meeting in Columbus, OH. ""We may see protests or proposals or calls for price caps this winter."" She said she is opposed to caps because they fail to solve the underlying problems, and she blamed the ""dysfunctional electricity grid"" in part for aggravating the run-up in natural gas prices. Asked whether he expected to see a public outcry from residentials this winter, Stephen L. Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary has borne the brunt of the California debacle (and whose 
Climate Prediction Center Winter  Outlook ? ??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South. East of the Mississippi  with the exception of Florida should be cooler this winter and most of  California and the northern half of the Rockies and the Dakotas.

News Brief: Enterprise Acquires Acadian Natural Gas Pipeline System Enterprise Products Partners L.P. said its operating partnership has executed a definitive agreement to purchase Acadian Gas, LLC from Coral Energy, LLC, an affiliate of Shell Oil Company, for $226 million in cash, inclusive of working capital. Acadian's assets are comprised of the Acadian, Cypress and Evangeline natural gas pipeline systems, which together include over 1,000 miles of pipeline and have over one billion cubic feet per day of capacity. The system includes a leased natural gas storage facility at Napoleonville, LA with 3.4 Bcf of capacity. The acquisition expands Enterprise Products' platform of fee-based, midstream energy services to include natural gas transportation and storage. Completion of this transaction is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. The purchase is expected to be completed in the fourth 
Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural gas deliverability by the end of this year. NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and transportation-related services, structured power and management services and energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's existing asset valuation. Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with headquarters in Houston. ""By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three years,"" said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year.

*UtiliCorp Wants To Spin Off Aquila Kansas City Business Journal =01) 09/29/2000 By Brian Cookson UtiliCorp United Inc. wants to parlay the rapid growth of its Aquila Energy= =20 subsidiary into a piece of a new, larger Aquila. The Kansas City-based utility has plans to spin off Aquila, possibly=20 retaining ownership of a third of it, selling another third to a partner an= d=20 offering the remainder in the stock market.  The move could allow Aquila, n= ow=20 engaged primarily in trading power and natural gas, to gain more hard asset= s=20 of its own and seek higher valuation from investors. =01&We really think the value of our company is much higher than the market= =20 currently values it because it values it as a utility,=018 Aquila spokesman= Al=20 Butkus said. Aquila, which moved its headquarters to Kansas City last year, has been the= =20 engine behind earnings growth for UtiliCorp.  For the second quarter of thi= s=20 year, Aquila reported earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $49.5=20 million, up 113 percent from the previous year.  UtiliCorp as a whole had= =20 EBIT of $103.9 million for the second quarter of 2000.

Note:  The market reaction is interesting.  One can surmise that quite a bit of the gas that was contracted for on Vector is firm utility gas.  The run up in Chicago may be temporary until alternate arrangements are completed. Vector Delay Confirms Market's Suspicions Future shippers on the new Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline had their fears confirmed Tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start-up date for the project, which was scheduled for Nov. 1 to coincide with the start-up of the long-awaited Alliance Pipeline, would be delayed until Dec. 1. Vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered construction of the pipeline, which --- when completed --- would provide initial takeaway for about 700 MMcf/d of the 1.3 Bcf/d of western Canadian gas that will be shipped to the Chicago market by Alliance. Alliance is due to begin operations on Oct. 31. The announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million-dollar question: ""where will that [Alliance] gas go?"" in the meantime. Alliance officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and LDCs serving the Chicago hub that could pick up the slack between Oct. 31 and Dec. 1. Alliance's Jack Crawford downplayed the impact of the Vector start-up delay on Alliance. ""We don't think [there will be] much effect at all. We have been working closely with Vector. Our connection with them, if it's not ready, is very close. We also have five other connections with other [existing] pipelines and LDCs"" in Chicago. Many shippers ""understand [that with ] a startup the magnitude of ours [Alliance] and Vector's, there are likely to be

Lorna ---------------------------------------------------- Dear CERA Members and Friends: Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude prices?? What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful calculations? One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates' (CERA) core businesses has been benchmark crude oil price analysis. In our new multiclient study, ""The Hole in the Barrel"", CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the structure of the market itself.? We argue the limits and real economic losses that can result from misunderstanding these prices - specifically the Brent benchmark - in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning, the magnitude of which can be significant, often amounting to dollars - not cents - per barrel. As an introduction to this new study, we would like to invite you to participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web presentation on October 12, 2000.? With the current volatility and high levels of energy prices, this conference call will bring clarity to these important and relevant issues. To enroll for the call, please RSVP to 1-800-289-0579 or 719-457-2550 and reference the Confirmation Code 984848 in order to participate in the call. In this detailed study, CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk about the oil price.? As part of the study, we: * Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and consider their long-term future given the steady decline of ""wet"" barrels, including how other price markers might evolve. * Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues (for a given volume of production) than is generally appreciated. * Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices (absolute price level, time and grade differentials), to show where revenue is being lost and what can be done to add it back again. * Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming, especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that they help to manage. In this evolving New World, while trading may or may not be good for you, not understanding the market can be fatal. CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS: * Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of internationally traded crude oils. * The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate contracts in the Brent market to different sectors of the oil industry * The risks and rewards of dealing in the Brent market Our speakers will address this topic for 20-30 minutes, with accompanying graphics presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer period.

Coastal Corp. announced that Engage Energy U.S., L.P. has changed its name to Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which coincides with the split of the Engage Energy joint venture by participants Coastal and Westcoast Energy. Effective on Oct. 3, the operations were divided into separate entities which are owned and operated solely by each company. Coastal Merchant Energy, which handles up to 3.5 Bcf/d, appointed James C. Dyer IV as president and CEO. ""Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P. will continue to provide a full spectrum of energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and transportation-related services, structured power and management services, and energy risk management services,"" said David A.

Kinder Morgan Transfers $300M in Assets to MLP Kinder Morgan, Inc. announced plans to contribute $300 million in assets to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., the company's master limited partnership. The largest asset to be contributed is Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, formerly MidCon Texas, a 2,600-mile natural gas pipeline system that extends from South Texas to Houston along the Texas Gulf Coast. Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing Systems, KMI's 50% interest in Coyote Gas Treating and KMI's 25% interest in Thunder Creek Gas Services. As consideration for the assets, KMI will receive $300 million, 50% in cash and 50% in KMP partnership units. KMI expects the transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. ""This transaction represents a true win-win for both KMI and KMP,"" said Kinder Morgan CEO Rich Kinder. ""It is expected to be accretive to cash available for distribution to KMP's unitholders by between 5-10 cents in 2001. The pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP because they complement existing KMP assets, have long-term contracts in place and offer significant growth opportunities."" Kinder noted that because the mix of consideration paid will include equity issued to KMI, it will not be necessary to raise funds for the transaction via a public offering of KMP units. ""KMI will also benefit from the transaction, as it will be able to reduce its debt by $150 million,"" Kinder said. ""Additionally, the transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share in 2001. By increasing its stake in the master limited partnership, KMI will enjoy 
Frontier Pipeline Project 
Note:  Williams does not give the amount of volume response they received in their open season.  540,000 Dth/d was their established volume at the onset.  Also, it is interesting that they are naming the Oklahoma intrastate markets as their market for the project. Western Frontier Pipe Gets Rave Reviews After successfully completing a non-binding open season on Sept. 21, for the Western Frontier project, Williams' gas pipeline unit plans to hold a binding open season in the near future to gauge the exact market interest in the project that would transport gas supply from the Rockies to the mid-continent region. ""We are very pleased with the interest the market has shown in our Western Frontier Project. We continue to believe that Western Frontier will be a cost-effective way to bring economically-priced Rockies supply into the mid-continent,"" said Kim Cocklin, vice president of customer services and rates for Williams' Central and Texas Gas pipeline systems. The Western Frontier Project is expected to transport up to 540,000 dth/d from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams' Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central system in southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton pipeline. The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Williams believes this project would be able to supply a ""seamless transport at an incremental cost"" to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central system. Through the Central system, customers would also be able to access storage including directly owned and third party storage fields. Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the mid-20 cents per dth. The company also expects a fuel rate of less than 1%. Expected to be in service during November 2003, the project will require the construction of almost 400 miles of pipeline and the addition of 13,000 HP. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Home Heating Costs to Soar this Winter Americans can expect home heating prices to jump as much as 44% this winter because of strong economic growth and high crude oil prices, according to the EIA. A winter with especially long periods of cold weather' could cause even higher prices because heating fuel storage levels are below average. Homes that use natural gas can expect to see the biggest jump in bills. Prices paid by residential customers are expected to average $8.58 per MMBtu, up about 30% from last winter's average of $6.61. The higher prices, combined with increased consumption, will push overall costs up to an average $780 this winter from $540 last year earlier, the EIA said in an annual report on winter fuels. High prices for competing petroleum-based fuels will help keep natural gas prices high. Homes with heating oil will pay about $949 for fuel this winter, up 25% from the $760  paid last winter. Prices will average about $1.37 per gallon, up 16% from last year's $1.18, the report said. The 4.5% of Americans who use propane to heat their homes will pay about 27% more this winter at $1,045, compared with $823 last year. Inventories of propane at the end of last month were about 62 million barrels, 3 million above last year's level. Distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, will be about 114 million to 118 million barrels at the start of the heating season, about 15% to 18% lower than last year, the report said. The government projection excludes the heating oil reserve created by the Clinton administration, which stores 2 million barrels. Distillate stocks in the East Coast are 41 million barrels, close to 40% less than last year's level. In New England stocks are over 60% below the 1999 level. The EIA estimated the monthly price of crude oil will remain above $28 per barrel for the rest of the year, and then gradually decline next year to an average $25 per barrel. Because of rising demand in Asia and continued growth in the US, higher oil production by OPEC has not been able to stem the rally in prices, the report said. US crude oil inventories are about 287 million barrels, 17 million barrels below last year. The deficit is smaller than last month, when there was a 26 million-barrel shortfall, though supplies are still 8% below normal and are not expected to move into the normal range before the end of winter, the report said.  Global oil demand this year is expected to increase 1.1 million barrels per day from last year and will grow by an additional 2 million barrels a day in 2001 to 78 million barrels a day, according to the report. The average retail price for gasoline, which was about $1.52 per gallon last week, will fall to about $1.46 per gallon in December and $1.40 by next March, the report said. The report says a very cold winter could cause Northeast heating oil prices to surge, and that could spill over into East Coast diesel markets. The government said the chances of this were greater this year because of tight distillate supplies, especially in the Northeast. Diesel prices will fall by about $0.09 to $1.55 per gallon in December and $1.35 by next summer, assuming normal conditions this

News Briefs: Chevron and Texaco Agree to $100 Billion Merger Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. announced plans to merge and ChevronTexaco Corp. In the merger, Texaco shareholders will receive 0.77 shares of Chevron common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron shareholders will retain their existing shares.  The exchange ratio represents approximately $64.87 per Texaco share based on Chevron's closing stock price of $84.25 on October 13.  The exchange ratio represents an 18% premium based upon Texaco's closing share price on October 13, and a 25% premium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during the 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron shareholders will own approximately 61% of the combined equity, and Texaco shareholders will own about 39%.  The combined company would have an enterprise value of more than $100 billion. The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and operations throughout the world.  In the U.S.,  ChevronTexaco would be the nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1 million BOE per day, and hold the nation's third largest reserve position,

From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati= on=20 of mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,= =20 and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than= =20 $0.20 above residual fuel oil. Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and= a=20 slightly lower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem= ber Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60. Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not= =20 expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas= =20 market. Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.= 5=20 Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return = to=20 the gas market should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil= d=20 through October, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much=20 greater, as distillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse= lf=20 in short supply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment= of demand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n= or=20 shutting down production comes easily or cheaply. Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain= s justifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20 significant settling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20 sustained in the mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).= =20 More luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to= =20 the gas market. Gas Storage--The Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20 approximately 8.5 Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag= e=20 5.5 Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of= =20 injections of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in= =20 futures prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of= =20 October. With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20 slowing of injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha= n=20 100 Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October. CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record= =20 low inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb= er. However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20 heating load from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic= h CERA estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,= =20 or even substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20 inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories= =20 will remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b= e=20 priced out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel= =20 oil. Regional Markets-Winter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start = of=20 winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri= ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20 between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t= he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with = the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset= =20 of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe= r=20 (see Table 3). CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load, but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November. * San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu for November. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should continue through November, with some slight widening in the Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively. * Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels, but there is little added delivery capacity into that market. CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s. Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20 uncertain. A line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of= =20 200-300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio= n=20 the pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20 quantities of gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses= s=20 precisely the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October = is=20 on par with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in= =20 2000, approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20 shallow trend does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected = to=20 produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl= y=20 build is expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive= =20 growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have= =20 accelerated; eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e= nd of=20 October. Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect= ed storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20 levels. PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord= er Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte= d=20 to be slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push= ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern= =20 Canadian demand. High Prices, Wide Differentials The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20 October.

ONEOK Acquires 56,200 Dth/d From Williams Williams and ONEOK reported yesterday that they have reached a two-year agreement in which Williams will provide incremental firm transportation service of 56,200 Dth/d to the Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) division of ONEOK. ""We have had a long-standing relationship with ONEOK through our service to its Kansas Gas Service division and we look forward to helping ONEOK serve its growing energy needs in Oklahoma,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president of Williams Gas Pipeline-SouthCentral (Central and Texas Gas systems). Service will begin on Nov. 1, and will require Williams to build two new meter stations along its existing pipeline system. A spokesman for ONG said the gas load from Williams was necessary to serve its steadily growing customer base of approximately 800,000 as the company unbundles its services. The transportation capacity will be used to serve customers in ONG's Oklahoma City and Enid, OK, markets. 
Alliance Deliveries Delayed until Nov. 13 In a move that is likely to send ripples through the market, particularly around Chicago, the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline extended its commercial in-service delay last week to Nov. 13 from Oct. 30. Pipeline officials said moisture and debris in the line caused the delay. ""As we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system 
Calpine Form Alliance 
News Briefs: +Calpine to Acquire SkyGen Energy Calpine Corp. said it plans to acquire SkyGen Energy LLC (SkyGen Energy) from Michael Polsky and from Wisvest Corp., a Wisconsin Energy Corp. affiliate, for $450 million, plus the assumption of certain obligations of SkyGen Energy. The SkyGen Energy acquisition -- along with other recently announced acquisitions -- would increase Calpine's 2004 operating portfolio to over 40,000 MW of generation. Upon closing of the transaction, expected during the third quarter of 2000, Calpine will increase its power portfolio by up to 13,500 MW of natural gas-fired generation in the U.S., and will acquire 34 General Electric 7 FA gas turbines. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will add three operating facilities (780 MW), three projects under construction (812 MW), 13 late-stage development facilities (5,258 MW) and 16 project development opportunities (6,615 MW). SkyGen was founded by Michael Polsky in 1991. SkyGen will continue to develop its portfolio of development projects as a wholly owned subsidiary of Calpine. Michael Polsky will serve as President of SkyGen and as a member of Calpine's Board of Directors. To fund the SkyGen Energy and other recently announced acquisitions, Calpine has obtained a $1 billion short-term credit facility with The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse First Boston and CIBC World Markets. The company expects to refinance this facility in the capital markets. ********** +Panda, Calpine Form Business Alliance Panda Energy International and Calpine Corp. formed a  business alliance involving eight power plant projects Panda has under development, representing nearly 10,000 MW of generating capacity. Under terms of the agreement, Panda will provide development capabilities and carry each of the projects to the construction phase. Calpine will have exclusive rights to construct, own and operate the plants. Panda will participate in 50% of the cash flow, above Calpine's priority return, in all the projects within the alliance. Included in the pact is the acquisition by Calpine of 24 General Electric 7FA combustion gas turbines and 12 steam turbines scheduled for delivery in 2001 to 2002. The first project to be developed under the alliance will be the Oneta Power Partners, L.P., a 1,000 MW  natural gas-fueled power plant now being built in Coweta, OK. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will pay Panda approximately $126 million, which includes reimbursement of development costs, payments for the gas and steam turbines and the Oneta facility. The Oneta transaction is expected to close in July. It is 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, June 23, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: New Peaks, New Prices Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1247 , In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season, which, along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more frequent use of gas-fired generators to meet demand, causes steadily rising power prices. CERA expects the West to be the only region in North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as demand reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. The convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last year's levels, growing demand for power, and reduced hydroelectric energy production when compared with levels in 1999 is pushing up western power prices. Merchant and other gas-fired generators will be pressed into service, experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of 1994. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads. The main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with year-earlier levels will be *  Peak WSCC load season. Summer weather will drive loads to the year's coincident peak, which is most likely to occur during the July/August period but could arrive any time during the June through October air-conditioning season. CERA expects demand growth of 3.1 percent in the third quarter compared with levels in 1999, which will push Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) coincident peak demand levels to 2.7 percent over 1999 levels. *  Waning hydroelectric output. Hydroelectric production is on its normal downward seasonal slide. This resource decline is more visible when compared with the 1999 hydro season, which was both abundant and prolonged. *  High utilization rates for gas-fired generators. Growing demand for electricity, coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy, will drive utilization rates of gas-fired power plants to their highest levels since the drought year of 1994. *  Higher fuel prices. Western gas prices have remained at $1.00-$1.50 per MMBtu above 1999 levels. Growing year-over-year gas demand for power generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets. These higher gas prices provide a boost to both on-peak and off-peak power prices of between $10 and $15 per megawatt-hour (MWh). Regional Power Market Drivers Power markets in the West are poised to break records for demand, peak load, and gas-fired plant utilization and, as a result, power prices. A return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will push demand for electricity up by 5,274 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the US West for the third quarter compared with 1999 levels, or almost 2,400 megawatts (MW) on average (see Table 1). This growth in the demand for electricity will also drive peak loads to new highs. CERA expects the 1999 WSCC coincident peak to be exceeded by 2.7 percent, climbing to nearly 119,000 MW. As was demonstrated by the mild summer of 1999, deviations from normal weather could boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure. Two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric production levels compared with 1999 levels. *  First, CERA expects West-wide total season hydroelectric production in 2000 of roughly 100 percent of historical average levels, substantially lower than the approximately 120 percent of average in 1999. *  Second, runoff was prolonged in 1999, serving to push a substantial portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period (see Figure 1). On average, CERA expects these factors will remove 9,187 GWh, or almost 4,200 average megawatts (aMW), from the western resource base compared with 1999 levels. Exacerbating this decline, refilling of reservoirs and flow restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant curtailments in power production at key Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facilities. Natural gas-fired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the expected increase in demand, while also replacing hydroelectric resources as they continue to decline. This will push average annual utilization rates of gas-fired combined cycle, steam, and cogeneration plants to approximately 38 percent in 2000--levels not experienced since the 41 percent annual average utilization rate in 1994, a year marked by drought and warmer-than-normal summer weather. Utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past 1999 levels, especially this summer. CERA anticipates a West-wide third quarter utilization rate of 59 percent for these facilities under normal summer weather conditions, compared with 46 percent for the same period of 1999. This level of utilization will certainly establish gas-fired generation as the floor to power prices during the third quarter, during not only the on-peak demand period but the off-peak as well. With natural gas prices at $1.00-$1.50 per MMBtu higher than 1999 levels, power prices are boosted by $10-$15 per MWh owing to fuel price increases alone. With supply tightness already evident in western power markets, the stage is set for increased price volatility compared with 1999 levels as episodes of hot weather require increased utilization of less-efficient generators throughout this summer. Pacific Northwest The water supply forecast for the Columbia River remains near average but has dropped a couple percentage points from last month. Flows are expected to remain at roughly 96 percent of average through September on the Lower Columbia and 103 percent of average on the Upper Columbia. Conditions overall are still sufficient to be considered average. This return to normal conditions in the Pacific Northwest should produce hydroelectric output nearly 2,700 GWh (18 percent) lower than last year for July and 8,405 GWh lower for the third quarter as a whole (see Table 2). The region's load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to elevate power prices in the Pacific Northwest relative to 1999 levels. Tighter supply conditions in California and the Southwest will attract energy exports from the Pacific Northwest, preserving a differential between the Pacific Northwest and California of about $1 per MWh on average. Price differentials between the Pacific Northwest and California have varied dramatically recently, with the north at times rising above those to the south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir filling operations. Since the end of May, volatility in both markets has pushed the difference between daily on-peak prices at COB and those in California from a premium of $120 per MWh to a discount of $55 per MWh within a few days. CERA expects that over the long run, California markets will clear at a premium as the summer progresses, but the differential will vary widely, with episodes of Pacific Northwest power pricing at a premium to those in California. California Despite below-average precipitation and snowpack this year, California reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal, ranging between 108 and 166 percent of average for the state's primary runoff regions. Under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly 4 percent (363 GWh) below last year's levels for the third quarter (see Table 2). With a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter 1999, cooling demand this summer will increase most in California, where weather was nearly 30 percent cooler than average last year. Recent day-ahead power prices in California have drawn attention to the West as the highest-cost market (if only temporarily) in North America. Record high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new day-ahead price records, with power prices on June 15 at $457 per MWh in the day-ahead on-peak market and real-time hourly prices at the market cap of $750 per MWh. Increased utilization of gas-fired generation and daily gas prices of around $5 per MMBtu (burner-tip in Southern California) have kept daily average off-peak prices between $40 and $80 per MWh. Notably, these higher price have occurred during periods when roughly 1,800 MW more coal-fire generation was available in the West compared with the same period in 1999. CERA expects prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer. Rockies and Southwest During summer 1999, the Rockies/Southwest was the only region to experience above-average cooling demand, suggesting that normal weather should bring only moderate demand growth of less than 1 percent (see Table 3). However, growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission transfer capability will pull energy from the Rockies/Southwest region when excess capacity is available, ensuring that prices in the region will remain tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the West. Palo Verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets, while maintaining their characteristic premium to the California Power Exchange during spring and early summer. CERA expects Southwest prices to strengthen relative to California when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of demand to the Southwest. However, California prices will maintain a premium on average to those in the Southwest, as the effects of the state's tight supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the Southwest or Pacific Northwest. Regional Gas Market Drivers Under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining supply and increasing gas demand for power generation, gas prices at the Henry Hub are expected to average $4.45 per MMBtu in July. The strong demand for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern half of the West. In the Rockies, pipeline constraints will keep differentials wide. The heightened call on gas demand for power generation, driven by the declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads, is expected to drive demand increases of 1.6 Bcf per day relative to July 1999 and 660 MMcf per day relative to June 2000 demand levels. Gas demand for power generation is expected to reach a monthly average record level of 4.9 Bcf per day in July (see Tables 4 and 5). These increases will result in declines in western storage injection rates and in exports from the West. Both Permian and San Juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the West Coast during July. Low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving North American gas pricing. The West is the one US region actually running a storage surplus, but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas supplies have eroded that surplus, particularly in California (see Table 6). Given the expected increases in gas demand, the western surplus should continue its decline. This decline and very high demand will reinforce the volatility in differentials already evident this summer. California Because of the early hot weather in the West and strong gas demand for power generation, Topock prices have been extremely high and volatile. So far this month, Topock has averaged over $0.30 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub. Flows on El Paso and Transwestern into California increased by over 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day during June relative to May averages, and flows are expected to continue to climb by an additional 400 MMcf per day during July. PGT continues to run near capacity (see Table 7). At the same time, the storage levels within California look likely to fall below last year's levels sometime during the month. This intense demand pressure--California demand should increase by nearly 500 MMcf per day in July relative to June--will keep utilization rates on import pipelines high and sustain Topock differentials. CERA expects the Topock to Henry Hub differential to average $0.30 per MMBtu during July (see Table 8). This high differential will likely persist through the summer, with differentials rising above $0.50 per MMBtu during West Coast heat waves. Southwest San Juan price differentials have been volatile, narrowing during periods of very high western demand. However, a very high utilization rate on pipeline capacity into California has widened the Topock-San Juan differential, and that wide gap is expected to persist. On average, San Juan differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern demand increases with western temperatures. Demand in the Southwest is expected to climb from 1.4 Bcf per day in June to 1.5 Bcf per day in July. This increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in Permian prices should result in an average San Juan differential to the Henry Hub of $0.18 per MMBtu. In the Permian Basin, prices are expected to strengthen as Texas power demand climbs. Combined with the pull on supplies from the West, Permian differentials should narrow from their current levels of $0.20 per MMBtu to below $0.10 per MMBtu. Pacific Northwest Strong June hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest so far this summer, but as hydroelectric output decreases in June and July, gas demand will increase dramatically. CERA expects an increase of nearly 200 MMcf per day during July relative to June levels. The limited demand so far has meant differentials between Malin and the Henry Hub of as much as $0.30 per MMBtu and Topock to Malin differentials of over $0.60 per MMBtu. The Malin to Henry Hub differential has narrowed slightly to around $0.20 per MMBtu. It should continue to strengthen with growth in regional demand and average $0.00 per MMBtu during July. Rocky Mountains Regional gas supply within the Rocky Mountains continues to increase, bolstered by continuing growth in the Powder River Basin. This April, exports out of the Rockies reached 3.2 Bcf per day, a record high. Although there is excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the Southwest on the Transcolorado and Northwest pipelines, high utilization rates have widened Rockies differentials with the rest of the West. In particular, Rockies to San Juan differentials have averaged nearly $0.25 per MMBtu for June after pricing close to parity earlier in the year. That gap should persist through the summer, as gas-fired generation climbs across the rest of the West. Demand is expected to average the same level in July as in June in the Rocky Mountains, where coal limits gas's gains in power generation. CERA expects prices within the Rockies to gather some support from increasing power loads in the Pacific Northwest, as well as from stronger differentials in the San Juan Basin. On average, Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to average $0.52 per MMBtu during July. In response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the Powder River Basin and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines, Trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend and expand the 500 mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska. Although timing and volumes have yet to be announced, the additional capacity could prevent serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region, which CERA would expect by 2002 without capacity additions. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables.

The result has been a steady and= =20 steep decline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 into the $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t= he=20 mid- $5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua= l=20 fuel oil in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20 inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade= quate supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to= a=20 quick return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap. Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe= r=20 20 accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif= t=20 in market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima= tely=20 3.8 Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and = 58=20 Bcf above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob= er=20 22. With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20 expected next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o= n October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table= =20 1). Is this inventory level ""enough""? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter= =20 under 15- year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf= =20 above the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20 withdrawals in the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo= ve=20 last year=01,s withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac= e=20 of a return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul= d bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20 winter, holding withdrawals down requires both of the following: * Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down. These markets represent approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return, should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol. * The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas. In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,= =20 particularly as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20 demand can be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c= an=20 be held reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar= ch=20 1996 and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag= e=20 of $3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was= =20 nearly 4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa= s=20 lower, and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20 customers in the United States.

Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired generation on the margin for most of November.

Quick Change in PG&E NW IT Allocation Within hours of a FERC vote yesterday ratifying proposed changes in its interruptible transportation (IT) queue, PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest announced new procedures effective today. The Commission rejected shippers complaints to the new scheme and accepted PG&E NW's tariff sheets as of Oct. 25, saying the revisions were ""generally in accord with industry practice and will simplify capacity allocation

FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J.

El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major player. The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the non-fee-based side. As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Note:  WEFA has made some interesting points in their conclusions of this study. Gas Turbines Headed for a 50% Meltdown High natural gas prices, performance issues and higher than expected maintenance costs, a general economic slowdown and several other key factors 
Note:  Raymond James and Associates is predicting gas prices to average $4.50 in 2001.  Consensus First Call estimates are now averaging $3.85 for 2001.  Read on to hear what the brokerage houses are predicting. Lorna Raymond James Sends Chills Up Gas Buyers' Spines Raymond James and Associates gave gas buyers a Halloween shriek yesterday that could be producing chills all the way through next April, perhaps even all of next year. The firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas prices this winter and said it expects prices to average $4.50/MMBtu in 2001. ""Regardless of a potentially warm winter, it is highly likely that the United States will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply,"" Raymond James said in its latest energy report. ""In other words, gas storage should test all-time low levels this winter regardless of weather. ""The situation should get worse, not better, next year. If we end the winter at all-time low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than we did this summer, then we should enter next winter with dangerously low levels of natural gas,"" Raymond James added. ""We believe that the United States will see gas demand increase by about 9 Bcf/d (or 15%) by the end of 2002 as new gas fired electric generation plants come on line. Unfortunately, even if every drilling rig is working, U.S. gas supply is likely to increase by less than 4 Bcf/d by the end of 2002. This means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over 5 Bcf/d of demand out of the gas supply/demand equation by 2002. At $5/Mcf, only about 1.5 Bcf/d of demand has been reduced so far. That means that gas prices must go 
Note:  There will be a briefing meeting on the project in Denver on Nov. 14 N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with direct access to several local distribution companies, including Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, NGPL, Northern and Vector. The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering ""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value. Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at (402) 398-7758 or James Hoff in Denver at (303) 575-6475, or see the 
El Paso declared an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Thursday that will remain in effect until further notice. The pipeline said it will limit scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system integrity. Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance

Note:  FYI Fitch Puts 2 CA Utilities on Negative Watch In the midst of the continuing uncertainty over regulatory treatment of growing wholesale electricity cost under-collections, Fitch Tuesday assigned a ""rating watch negative"" designation to the securities of California's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison (and its parent company, Edison International). In addition, it lowered Edison's commercial paper rating one notch to ""F1"" from ""F1+"". Fitch cited the need for ""significant and extensive regulatory decisions"" to resolve the continuing problem of retail utility electric rate under-collections plaguing both utilities. It indicated that with the ""watch negative"" status, the independent rating service expects to review the ratings within six months. A spokesperson for PG&E Corp., the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric, said the Fitch move doesn't lower any of its ratings, but it ""underscores the seriousness of the situation (in California) and the need for all the parties to come together for a collaborative solution."" The companies have asked for relief from the California Public Utilities Commission (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). Edison is the target of an investors' lawsuit which accuses it of illegally booking as revenue the wholesale power costs that have yet to be collected. (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1). The Fitch move had no effect on PG&E's latest utility debt line extension of $1.3 billion that was implemented recently in response to the continuing under-collections, the spokesperson said. Fitch reiterated that through September the two utilities had booked under-collections exceeding $5 billion collectively and that wholesale power prices continue to exceed the utilities' frozen retail rate levels. ""While these amounts exceed immediate funding requirements, their recovery through rates is uncertain,"" Fitch stated in its announcement on the negative watch. ""Barring a change in regulatory policy, PG&E and SoCal Edison anticipate they will be unable to recover their under-collections before the end of the statutory rate freeze period ending March 31, 2002. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
El Paso extended an unauthorized overpull penalty situation yesterday for all customers. ""You are urged to immediately review your supply/demand balance, and the performance of your suppliers, to insure sufficient gas is being delivered to El Paso to cover the gas being taken off the system,"" the pipeline said. To ensure system integrity, El Paso is placing limits on scheduled volumes at interconnects that are underperforming.

PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 levels. The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit charge. ""We're just keeping our legal options open,"" said a San Francsco-based utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders. Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9 billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's 
Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time (400-500 MMBtu/d hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to commission the Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through. Some predictors are saying the delay may get longer. Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. ""Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has been removed from the line,"" says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. ""However, periodic reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago."" A spokesman said the debris included ""bits of foam"" that came off equipment used to extract moisture following hydrostatic testing. The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the operation together around the clock 365 days a year. ""It's a tremendously complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A consent agreement has been filed with the FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP. El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would result in a $20 million loss. The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General. 
Note:  CERA gives a storage prediction for end of withdrawal season under a normal winter. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, November 10, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Taking up the Slack Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1415 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111000_11/nag_alt_111000_11_ab.html Cold weather in the Midwest and reduced storage injections have taken up much of the temporary slack that developed in the gas market during the warm October. As expected, prices have responded quickly to the cold, with the December futures contract price advancing by over $0.75 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the past week. As cold weather develops, late winter supply availability is still uncertain in CERA's view. For that reason, dual-fuel markets must remain off of gas, and market fundamentals support the recent price rebound, which places gas prices again at a premium to resid. CERA estimates that US working storage inventories as of the end of October were approximately 2,746 billion cubic feet (Bcf), an all-time low for that date by 64 Bcf (see table below). Storage injections of 36 Bcf for the week ending November 3 were higher than a normal weather pattern would indicate, but more normal weather for the remainder of the month would result in withdrawals averaging 3.5 Bcf per day during November. This withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards but 2.5 Bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two years (see table below). This pace of withdrawals places inventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of 771 Bcf under normal winter weather conditions, only 13 Bcf above the previous all-time low. This market remains tight. Although added supplies will begin to help by the end of the winter, for now some demand must still be priced out of the market in order to preserve storage inventories. **end** Follow URL for HTML version of this message only. ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate Program, the company said. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations.

Williams to Expand Kern River by 124,500 Dth/d Kern River Gas Transmission, a subsidiary of Williams, said it planned on filing an application yesterday with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The company said the California Expansion Project will not only provide additional natural gas capacity from Wyoming to markets in California, but also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on the recent approval by FERC of Kern River's Extended Term Rate Program. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The project includes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. Kern River said the $80 million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. The company said demand for firm transportation on Kern River was driven by several factors: the diversion of Canadian gas supplies to markets in the Midwest from the Pacific region; increased production in the Rocky Mountain basin; strong economic growth in Kern River's market areas; and increased demand from gas-fired electric generation facilities. Williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the Kern River pipeline. ""The demand for competitively priced transportation to markets in Nevada and California continues to grow. At the same time, gas producers in the Rocky Mountain basin are stepping up production. An 
Kern River discovered a mechanical problem with an oil seal at the Fillmore Compressor Station in Utah. Fillmore will be inoperable while repairs are made Nov. 30, but no impact to firm capacity is expected. However, interruptible capacity will be reduced as necessary for the Nov. 28-29 gas days and will not be available Nov. 30. Northwest noted that despite putting its system into entitlement and issuing a realignment OFO, primary scheduled volumes through Kemmerer (WY) Station remain greater than physical capacity. Therefore, starting today the pipeline is invoking a ""must-flow OFO"" provision of its tariff. Until further notice, shippers with primary corridor rights southbound through Kemmerer are required to flow up to 10% of their contract demand from receipt points north of Kemmerer to delivery points south of Kemmerer or take some other mutually agreeable action to alleviate the Kemmerer capacity problem.

American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111500_18/nag_alt_111500_18_ab.html ********************************************************* After a warm October, the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November, a heavy early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter. Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750 billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record low heading into the heating season, and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next, difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil, but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end users may be required. None of these measures comes easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time high for December. But even this estimate could prove low. If the current cold snap extends through early December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00 per MMBtu range. Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month, increasing the withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of the past two years. By the end of this month, the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to 350 Bcf. CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996 all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter, as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced out of the market. Demand-Keeping Warm After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter (November through March) was the warmest of the decade, and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season. Under normal weather conditions, * Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5 Bcf per day higher than last year's. * Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day in January. * December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per day relative to last December. Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day relative to normal weather. Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight, there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run, which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market. This winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 MMcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of 4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November, with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching. Supply-The Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the soaring gas-related rig count. * The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in 2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam play. * Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews. Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February, with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline. Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again, this time until December 1. Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf per day. During November that total should climb to 750 MMcf per day, despite the later published start date. With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast, differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA expects a December average differential of $0.25 per MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average $0.20 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per MMBtu for December. * Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15 per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices $0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at $5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000 MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's weather be colder than normal, we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000. These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized. Canadian Markets-Winter Begins The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East. Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf below the five-year average. Even with modest withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs. Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well above the five-year average. With the eastward movement of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin. This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada. The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal ""freeze-up,"" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year. Further Delays for Alliance? The ""commercial"" in-service date for Alliance has been delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line, delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant, the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up since September. It is estimated that flows for November will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year- over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern Canada. High Prices: Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a result of this increased pull. For December, the differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.10 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this message with associated Tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Western Undeterred By Grueling Regulatory Process Expressing frustration but continuing its resolve, Texas-based Western Hub Properties is ironing out some ""technical issues"" of financing with California regulators and now expects to start construction in February on its delayed Lodi gas storage field in northern California. The merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year, said Western Hub's California-based manager, Jim Fossum, who added that with faster approvals, the project could have been in service during this summer's electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages. Despite the regulatory struggle, he said the company still plans to go through with its other California storage project near Bakersfield and the natural gas hub called Wheeler Ridge. Western has acquired leases on the property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed site over the first three to six months of next year. The company intends to make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001.

El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection program. Line 1100 between Eunice and Pecos River Stations will be smart pigged Sunday (postponed one day), causing a 200 MMcf/d flow reduction through Eunice to the South Mainline. Six interconnects will not be able to deliver into El Paso for 10 hours that day. Another smart pigging of Line 1100 between Pecos River and Guadalupe Stations will occur Nov. 22 (also postponed one day), requiring a reduction of 200 MMcf/d through Pecos River. Line 1203 (Maricopa Line) pigging will be done Nov. 21-24, reducing the line's capacity by 60 MMcf/d and affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the Phoenix area.

In a letter last month (see Daily GPI, Oct. 19), Northwest announced a policy revision allowing a shipper holding capacity from Sumas to off-system delivery points to amend primary delivery points and shorten the path without being subject to a contractual OFO upon extending its contract term. However, citing ""the current OFO situation on the pipeline system,"" Northwest said last week the policy change is under review and has been suspended until further notice. El Paso reported Thursday an injection unit at its Washington Ranch storage facility had gone down for emergency maintenance. Capacity through Pecos River Station has been reduced by 100 MMcf/d until further notice, causing the pipeline to impose allocations on Permian Basin production and deliveries of San Juan Basin gas to the South Mainline. El Paso said work on Lines 1106 and 1107 was extended by one more day, causing the shut-in of deliveries into El Paso at the IUTBENED and IHYBENDM interconnects to continue through Dec. 1. The delay also postpones scheduled work on Line 3137, which now will be shut in Dec. 4-5, affecting the IVALEROZ, ISONORA, ISHOZONA and IBARNHRT points. Line 3177 is scheduled for Dec. 7 inspection, affecting IMOBILPE.

Transportation Notes Projecting that linepack would slip below its minimum target level through Thursday, Pacific Gas & Electric issued a systemwide Stage 3 OFO, effective today until further notice. The order carries penalties of $5/Dth for negative daily imbalances exceeding a 3% tolerance. As a result of warmer area weather and banking on its system, Northwest said it is operationally feasible to loosen conditions of its entitlement for delivery points north of Kemmerer (WY) Station. A Declared Stage II (8% tolerance) Overrun Entitlement will take effect today; through Tuesday the pipeline was in a Stage I (3%) Entitlement. A shipper is subject to penalties for overtakes north of Kemmerer that exceed an amount 8% greater than its confirmed nominations. El Paso will take the B turbine at Cornudas Station in West Texas down for maintenance today and Thursday, reducing South Mainline capacity there by 60 MMcf/d. However, Cornudas capacity has not been fully utilized recently, the pipeline said, so this reduction should not affect current markets. The Kinder Morgan pipeline group (NGPL, Kinder Morgan Interstate, Trailblazer, Canyon Creek, KN Wattenburg and TransColorado) reminded shippers it has a new 24-hour hotline phone number for information and questions about point confirmations and related issues: (713) 369-9683.

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market. NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis market. ""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is scheduled for completion in June of 2002. NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the area. ""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season will determine the final scope of the project. ""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the Houston audience. ""In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry,"" he said, pointing to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things upside down. When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy companies are now adopting that method. In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy industry. ""We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom of this synopsis, the web site address  will direct you to the full report released today if you would like further information. EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from $2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's latest report. EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for about half the change in energy projections. EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. ""In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases

American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1432 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/113000_15/nag_alt_113000_15_ab.html ********************************************************* Cold November weather, with heating degree-days 22 percent above normal through the twenty-fifth, fueled withdrawals from storage that CERA estimates will average approximately 8.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day for the month, near the all-time record for November set in 1995. This is approximately 5.0 Bcf per day higher than the previously expected withdrawal rate under normal weather conditions. The result is that storage inventories as of the end of the month are about 500 Bcf below the year-earlier level and are on track to dip well into record low territory by the end of the winter (see Table 1). For December, normal weather would result in storage withdrawals of 17.0 Bcf per day on average for the month. At that rate, storage inventories would fall below 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the year, the first time that has ever occurred. By the end of March CERA expects working inventories to be reduced to 606 Bcf in the United States, compared with the previous record low of 758 Bcf. This weather and high withdrawal rates have moved prices higher within the wide and volatile range between residual fuel oil and distillate, with gas prices moving farther above those of resid ($4.75 to $5.00) and closer to the price of distillate fuel oil (approximately $7.00). Strength in the oil market has kept the resid-distillate range high, but should gas test either boundary of this range, the price of either distillate or resid would move as well. Under normal weather CERA now expects December prices to average $6.25 at the Henry Hub, a higher level within this range reflective of reduced storage inventories. Although prices have abated somewhat in recent days and will continue to rise and fall with weather and weather forecasts, fundamentals now are so tight that a return to cold weather would quickly drive prices back above $6.50 and potentially above $7.00 at the Henry Hub. It is only at that level or above that any significant additional demand response is likely, and even then such a response would require time. The possibility of curtailments of interruptible loads late this winter has grown, while the possibility of significant price relief appears increasingly remote. **end** Follow URL for HTML version of this message with associated Table. ********************************************************* Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, ""Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future"" in Houston, February 12-16, 2001!

El Paso Puts Off Maintenance to Meet CA Demand 
Distributed Power: The Next Big Investment? With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters. With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the ""next big investment opportunity for the coming decade."" In Winters' 250 page report, ""Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: Set for a Revolution-Part 2,"" he examines technologies and companies within the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage of the current situation. ""Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in the early 1980's,"" said Winters. ""Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of high quality, reliable power,"" added Winters. According to his research, microturbines are the best positioned of the ""new"" technologies that would be able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, efficient and very versatile. ""They can be used as a main power source, a back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in traditional energy prices,"" the analyst said. ""Microturbines can also be used in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access to electricity."" Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other fuels as well. In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering flywheel technology, as a ""buy"" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading manufacturer of microturbines, as ""attractive."" The companies are in addition to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

American Gas Memeber: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/120800_18/nag_alt_120800_18_ab.html ********************************************************* Western Markets Disconnect The western energy markets are currently in a pricing crisis. Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California, and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West. Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over $40.00 per MMBtu during December after averaging over $15.00 per MMBtu through the second half of November. Extreme weather, strong power demand for gas, and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor. 
Update from CERA on pricing and rest of the season. 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, December 08, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Storm Arrives Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/120800_16/nag_alt_120800_16_ab.html ********************************************************* Cold Weather Path Colder-than-normal weather through November and forecasted cold for the first half of December throughout the Midwest and Northeast have driven gas prices well into record territory, with the January Henry Hub price trading near $9.00 per MMBtu and closing above $8.00 on the New York Mercantile Exchange December 6. This six-week cold period and the quick depletion of already low storage inventories has established prices at or above CERA's cold weather path for the remainder of the winter and in all likelihood beyond. If December storage withdrawals are as high as CERA now expects, the gas market will remain on the cold weather path through 2001 as well, even if weather returns to normal during the second half of December. The enormous increase in storage injections that is likely to be required next summer would keep the pressure on gas markets throughout the year. So long as weather remains cold (or even normal) this winter, a new market dynamic is in effect in which gas prices interact more with distillate fuel oil prices rather than with those of residual fuel oil. In addition, gas is likely to have an increasingly direct influence on power prices in the growing number of regions in which gas-fired generation is now on the margin in winter. This winter, the gas market is likely to rediscover for the first time in decades which end users value natural gas most highly, and which ultimately do not. The gas market is also rediscovering the value of firm pipeline capacity, particularly into market areas. Both the West Coast and the Northeast have experienced even more extreme price spikes, with daily prices in both regions peaking above $20.00 per MMBtu. Indeed, the shortage of gas in California is so acute that prices above $40.00 per MMBtu have been reported. If sustained, these price levels will induce a political reaction that will reverberate throughout the industry. Storage Update-Even High Seems Low Panic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat as storage withdrawals for the week ending December 1, at 73 billion cubic feet (Bcf), proved to be less than expected. This withdrawal was half the previous week's rate, and in CERA's view actual withdrawals for both weeks probably lie between these two readings. (In some cases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings in the AGA survey.) But even the 73 Bcf figure, though a significant retreat from the previous week's rate, is high by historical standards. One would have to go back to 1994 to find a higher reading for a comparable week in the AGA survey. Inventories as of the beginning of December, at an estimated 2,466 Bcf (see Table 1), were 525 Bcf below the year-earlier level, and this deficit is likely to increase substantially during December. If weather forecasts indicating colder-than-normal weather through mid-December in key heating markets hold true, storage withdrawals for the month will average approximately 20.0 Bcf per day. This rate is an increase from CERA's normal weather estimate of 17.0 Bcf per day, and even this rate depends on weather returning to normal in mid- December. This level of withdrawals would leave only 1,846 Bcf in storage on January 1, an inventory 663 Bcf below the year-earlier level. Assuming normal weather, such an inventory would place storage on track to reach a March minimum of 488 Bcf, 270 Bcf below the 1996 record low. At a US inventory level this low, many storage operators would be dipping into base-load gas in order to support service even to firm gas customers. * Physical deliverability from storage fields will be significantly lower this year in midwinter, forcing a greater reliance on pipeline gas and peaking facilities during January and February. The actual reduction in field deliverability is impossible to quantify, but storage inventories cannot be withdrawn at steady rates throughout the winter; withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced. *  Pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through 2001 and probably into 2002. During the past two summers, high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall US storage injections to reach barely 1.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). If normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter, 2.2 Tcf of injections-which would be nearly impossible to achieve-would be required during 2001 if inventories are to recover to 2.7 Tcf at peak. If weather this winter is merely normal from mid-December through March, going into winter next year the United States will have considerably less gas in storage. Reaching even the 2,362 Bcf level, according to CERA estimates (see Table 1), would require an additional 275 Bcf of injections next year, and that alone would prove challenging. Price-The Cold Weather Path The weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above CERA's cold weather path for this winter (see Table 2). Storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through mid-December proves accurate, and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense. For these reasons CERA's outlook for prices for January and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold weather path.  Prices could take an even higher path, particularly if colder-than-normal weather endures beyond mid-December or returns on a sustained basis in January or February. Several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will begin to enter the market during the winter, but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over. Such factors include a building US supply capability, growing imports, softening oil prices (allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends), and potentially weakening economic growth. Although the influence of these factors will increase, it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer. Demand-The Difficult Next Round of Switching With gas prices hitting new record highs, CERA expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market. Because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since May, however, the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred. Even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate (approximately $7.23 per MMBtu in New York), switching from gas to distillate requires changes in long-standing consumer habit, will occur only over time, and is likely limited in volume. Significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself. There are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets: * Additional switching to resid in industrial boilers. The next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector, through additional fuel switching to resid (and to some extent to distillate). These markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume. CERA estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts (less than 0.5 Bcf per day) in switching to resid, given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than $0.50 per MMBtu. * Investment in restoring switching capability. As premiums move far beyond this level, industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial short-term levels. However, such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets. CERA estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year, switching to resid could eventually reach as high as 1.3 Bcf per day. There is already some movement here; given the impact of high gas prices on earnings, energy prices have already begun to receive management attention. * Switching to distillate. US Department of Energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly 1.3 Bcf per day to distillate in the short term. This switch would represent additional distillate demand of over 200,000 barrels per day (bd) in a US market of 3.8 million barrels. This marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price, and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation. In addition, the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a long-term solution to tight markets. * Shutting down industrial plants. Also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock. The major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries, and, not surprisingly given the tight margins available, manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand. However, in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk. Whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the Gulf Coast is relatively readily replaced by imports, substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast (because of transportation logistics) and for facilities whose production is linked to value-added fertilizer products. Hence, CERA still estimates that even with nonexistent margins, substantial ammonia production would continue, with additional losses of perhaps 200 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed. Extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of North American methanol capacity, putting at risk another 100 to 200 MMcf per day of gas demand for that sector. Switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals, paper, and refining sectors in the South and the food products sector in the Midwest. Continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the South Central region. For process users, even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term. Energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users, and a physical changeover would be time-intensive and elemental in its impact on end-use product quality. The Northeast-Cold Weather Operations Begin All of the Northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed, or are highly likely to need to impose, transportation restrictions of various types. The most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services (secondary and interruptible type services), which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines. Other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match. Even hourly flow orders have also been implemented. These actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected. Whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions, the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up. The spot market, primarily made up of nonfirm customers, has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area, as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week. The result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to Henry Hub. At one point, gas for next-day delivery to New York traded near $24.00 per MMBtu delivered, although the average price was closer to $14.20. These high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas. Although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal, CERA now expects basis into the New York citygate to average $1.31 per MMBtu for December and $1.36 per MMBtu for January. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated tables. ********************************************************* Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, ""Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future"" in Houston, February 12-16, 2001!

High Prices Force Chemicals to Sell Gas, Futures Chemical companies, forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices, are nevertheless making money --- by selling gas futures contracts. Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp. became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs. Iowa-based Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December natural gas purchases, and shutdown 50% of its Verdigis, OK, ammonia facility. The company had previously reported that it would not operate its Bytheville, AR, and Beaumont, TX, facilities during the month of December as well. In a similar maneuver, Mississippi Chemical Corp., a producer of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium-based products in Mississippi, Louisiana and New Mexico, reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from January forward, in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices. Mississippi Chemical said it expects to realize a pre-tax gain of $16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31 from the recently sold contracts. The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices. An overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low, while gas prices, a feedstock for some chemicals, continue to climb. The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products, said Ron Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute. Duke Energy's Ken Nyiri, divisional director of strategic planning and research, commented on Mississippi Chemical's transactions, ""I guess they probably made about a $4/MMBtu margin on the gas, which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia; in fact, they would have lost $30/unit. Their ammonia was probably costing them about $205/ton to make (with gas bought at $5/MMBtu in November) and the market today is at $205 so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs. By selling the gas at around $9/MMBtu they made $4/MMBtu. It was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it, or do they sell the gas

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to markets in New Jersey and New York. Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered by the original certificate. The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The $80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines currently are running full. 
Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge new rival for Western Canadian supply. ""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
Calpine Announces Development of 600-MW Energy Center Calpine Corporation announced that through a development agreement with Adair International Oil and Gas, Inc. it has secured the rights to develop, build, own and operate a 600-MW natural gas-fired electricity generating facility near the town of Thermal in Riverside County, CA. The $275 million Teayawa Energy Center will be located on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians' land through a long-term lease agreement between Calpine and the Torres Martinez. Construction of the project may begin as soon as mid-2001, with commercial operation slated to begin in late 2003. The project will interconnect with an existing transmission line adjacent to the property. As the power project is located on Native American land, the lead permitting agency under the National Environmental Policy Act is the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Additionally, BIA approval is necessary to ensure that the Teayawa Energy Center appropriately meets the cultural, environmental and economic

News Briefs: +Calpine to Acquire SkyGen Energy Calpine Corp. said it plans to acquire SkyGen Energy LLC (SkyGen Energy) from Michael Polsky and from Wisvest Corp., a Wisconsin Energy Corp. affiliate, for $450 million, plus the assumption of certain obligations of SkyGen Energy. The SkyGen Energy acquisition -- along with other recently announced acquisitions -- would increase Calpine's 2004 operating portfolio to over 40,000 MW of generation. Upon closing of the transaction, expected during the third quarter of 2000, Calpine will increase its power portfolio by up to 13,500 MW of natural gas-fired generation in the U.S., and will acquire 34 General Electric 7 FA gas turbines. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will add three operating facilities (780 MW), three projects under construction (812 MW), 13 late-stage development facilities (5,258 MW) and 16 project development opportunities (6,615 MW). SkyGen was founded by Michael Polsky in 1991. SkyGen will continue to develop its portfolio of development projects as a wholly owned subsidiary of Calpine. Michael Polsky will serve as President of SkyGen and as a member of Calpine's Board of Directors. To fund the SkyGen Energy and other recently announced acquisitions, Calpine has obtained a $1 billion short-term credit facility with The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse First Boston and CIBC World Markets. The company expects to refinance this facility in the capital markets. ********** +Panda, Calpine Form Business Alliance Panda Energy International and Calpine Corp. formed a  business alliance involving eight power plant projects Panda has under development, representing nearly 10,000 MW of generating capacity. Under terms of the agreement, Panda will provide development capabilities and carry each of the projects to the construction phase. Calpine will have exclusive rights to construct, own and operate the plants. Panda will participate in 50% of the cash flow, above Calpine's priority return, in all the projects within the alliance. Included in the pact is the acquisition by Calpine of 24 General Electric 7FA combustion gas turbines and 12 steam turbines scheduled for delivery in 2001 to 2002. The first project to be developed under the alliance will be the Oneta Power Partners, L.P., a 1,000 MW  natural gas-fueled power plant now being built in Coweta, OK. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will pay Panda approximately $126 million, which includes reimbursement of development costs, payments for the gas and steam turbines and the Oneta facility. The Oneta transaction is expected to close in July. It is 
News : EnronOnline Forms Alliances with HoustonStreet and True Quote Time:  2:30 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000 HoustonStreet Exchange has branched out into realms of the top energy e-commerce platforms today by signing an agreement to post the North American electricity and natural gas prices of EnronOnline. The prices will be posted automatically on HoustonStreet.com and traders will be able to act on the EnronOnline prices via either platform. The addition of EnronOnline pricing will correspond with the launch of HoustonStreet's natural gas platform in September, the companies said. Enron also signed an agreement today to post its gas and power prices simultaneously on True Quote.com. EnronOnline has conducted commodity transactions worth more than $90 billion in 2000. It posts two-way prices for more than 800 products in global energy and commodities markets. 
Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time (400-500 MMBtu/d hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to commission the Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through. Some predictors are saying the delay may get longer. Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. ""Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has been removed from the line,"" says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. ""However, periodic reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago."" A spokesman said the debris included ""bits of foam"" that came off equipment used to extract moisture following hydrostatic testing. The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the operation together around the clock 365 days a year. ""It's a tremendously complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A consent agreement has been filed with the FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP. El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would result in a $20 million loss. The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General. 
Note:  CERA gives a storage prediction for end of withdrawal season under a normal winter. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, November 10, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Taking up the Slack Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1415 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111000_11/nag_alt_111000_11_ab.html Cold weather in the Midwest and reduced storage injections have taken up much of the temporary slack that developed in the gas market during the warm October. As expected, prices have responded quickly to the cold, with the December futures contract price advancing by over $0.75 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the past week. As cold weather develops, late winter supply availability is still uncertain in CERA's view. For that reason, dual-fuel markets must remain off of gas, and market fundamentals support the recent price rebound, which places gas prices again at a premium to resid. CERA estimates that US working storage inventories as of the end of October were approximately 2,746 billion cubic feet (Bcf), an all-time low for that date by 64 Bcf (see table below). Storage injections of 36 Bcf for the week ending November 3 were higher than a normal weather pattern would indicate, but more normal weather for the remainder of the month would result in withdrawals averaging 3.5 Bcf per day during November. This withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards but 2.5 Bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two years (see table below). This pace of withdrawals places inventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of 771 Bcf under normal winter weather conditions, only 13 Bcf above the previous all-time low. This market remains tight. Although added supplies will begin to help by the end of the winter, for now some demand must still be priced out of the market in order to preserve storage inventories. **end** Follow URL for HTML version of this message only. ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate Program, the company said. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. 
Williams to Expand Kern River by 124,500 Dth/d Kern River Gas Transmission, a subsidiary of Williams, said it planned on filing an application yesterday with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The company said the California Expansion Project will not only provide additional natural gas capacity from Wyoming to markets in California, but also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on the recent approval by FERC of Kern River's Extended Term Rate Program. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The project includes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. Kern River said the $80 million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. The company said demand for firm transportation on Kern River was driven by several factors: the diversion of Canadian gas supplies to markets in the Midwest from the Pacific region; increased production in the Rocky Mountain basin; strong economic growth in Kern River's market areas; and increased demand from gas-fired electric generation facilities. Williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the Kern River pipeline. ""The demand for competitively priced transportation to markets in Nevada and California continues to grow. At the same time, gas producers in the Rocky Mountain basin are stepping up production. An 
Kern River discovered a mechanical problem with an oil seal at the Fillmore Compressor Station in Utah. Fillmore will be inoperable while repairs are made Nov. 30, but no impact to firm capacity is expected. However, interruptible capacity will be reduced as necessary for the Nov. 28-29 gas days and will not be available Nov. 30. Northwest noted that despite putting its system into entitlement and issuing a realignment OFO, primary scheduled volumes through Kemmerer (WY) Station remain greater than physical capacity. Therefore, starting today the pipeline is invoking a ""must-flow OFO"" provision of its tariff. Until further notice, shippers with primary corridor rights southbound through Kemmerer are required to flow up to 10% of their contract demand from receipt points north of Kemmerer to delivery points south of Kemmerer or take some other mutually agreeable action to alleviate the Kemmerer capacity problem. See the Northwest bulletin board for details. El Paso:  Saying linepack had stabilized, El Paso canceled Wednesday an

Author: Zenker, Mortizburke E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1264 , Recent events in California, culminating in new market rules established for the energy and ancillary services markets, indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they established. The hot weather in California during June triggered high electricity demand, corresponding record-breaking power prices, and rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area. Although the economic impact of both the outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant, a recent decision by California's Independent System Operator (ISO) to intervene in the markets by lowering price caps through the summer of 2000 from $750 to $500 per megawatt-hour (MWh) may prove to be the most important product of the market events.* Ironically, the proclivity to continue to change the market rules, whatever the intention, could create market distortions that delay the addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and driving away needed capit! al. This would only prolong the state's supply shortage and resultant high prices. Although the record-setting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area is not likely to be repeated, the West as a whole will experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this summer. CERA expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand this year, but the high price levels of June will be repeated during peak demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of 2001 and possibly 2002. The Pressure Builds The blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall, but instead by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient quantities of power to the San Francisco area. The quantity of generating capacity out of service in the West was near average levels, despite a nuclear unit outage in Washington. Although the blackouts were brief and wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures, the intense scrutiny over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they designed. The market's architects assumed that competition would lower wholesale prices in the state. However, prices in June have been roughly eight times higher than in 1997's prerestructured California market, leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are flawed, requiring additional caps and market rules. Although some state officials strongly favored lo! wering the price caps, many within the ISO's Board of Governors strongly opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to tight supply and demand fundamentals. The current tight supply situation in California and the West as a whole is a product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with the slow process of permitting new power plants. Owing to strong economic growth in California in 1998 and 1999 (5.2 and 5.5 percent, respectively*), capacity margins have shrunk from 12 percent in 1997 to 7 percent in 2000. Demand growth throughout the West has reduced the amount of energy available for export from the Pacific Northwest and Southwest to California. As a result, even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the curtailment of approximately 2,800 megawatts (MW) of interruptible load within the state, California capacity margins will fall well below North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reliability criteria (roughly 15 percent) this summer. The West is the only region in North America that will experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in 1999 under normal weather conditions. CERA anticipates peak demand growth to continue to outpace new capacity additions through 2001, with slightly growing capacity margins in 2002. At these levels, an unusual amount of either plant capacity or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions would require the ISO to mandate blackouts of a portion of the state's load to maintain the overall stability of the grid. Thus, the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure prices to high levels, which may provoke legislators and regulators to attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rules. Market Distorting Effects Under tremendous pressure from some legislators, regulators, and market participants, the California ISO Board of Governors lowered the current price caps on energy from $750 to $500 per MWh in a special meeting conducted June 28.** Owing to the interconnectedness of western markets, the decision to lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to change the rules governing California's electricity markets will affect power market participants throughout the West. * Profitability of existing and future generators degraded. High power prices and volatility levels in June, although detrimental to most buyers, provide strong encouragement to plant developers. Limiting the level of price fly-ups degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a return on that capital. In most periods of the year, competition drives prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital. Generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in California's energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply scarcity. Existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the imposition of caps. * Supply shortfall prolonged. The process of siting and permitting power plants in California is cumbersome, requiring as long as five years from plant proposal to synchronization with the grid. The California Energy Commission (CEC), the state agency charged with approving new plants, has repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the state. Price-dampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that California officials may continue to reengineer the state's power markets to the detriment of generator profitability and, when added to the difficult permitting process, potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to meet rapidly growing state demand. Prominent plant developers have recently indicated that markets outside of California may provide a more stable market and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating equipment such as turbines. * Trading positions affected. Lowering price caps reduces the degree of price volatility and the level of overall average prices. Market participants have executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous, higher price cap. By lowering the price cap, not only are the value of existing physical (e.g., power plant) and financial (e.g., forward contracts) positions significantly affected, but market participants must also incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into their trading.* * Circumventing market rules. The variety of energy and capacity markets in California, as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state, provides opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules, further distorting the markets in the West. Although lowering price caps in California will likely temporarily reduce price levels, the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in the market. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert.

American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111500_18/nag_alt_111500_18_ab.html ********************************************************* After a warm October, the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November, a heavy early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter. Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750 billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record low heading into the heating season, and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next, difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil, but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end users may be required. None of these measures comes easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time high for December. But even this estimate could prove low. If the current cold snap extends through early December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00 per MMBtu range. Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month, increasing the withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of the past two years. By the end of this month, the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to 350 Bcf. CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996 all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter, as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced out of the market. Demand-Keeping Warm After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter (November through March) was the warmest of the decade, and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season. Under normal weather conditions, * Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5 Bcf per day higher than last year's. * Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day in January. * December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per day relative to last December. Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day relative to normal weather. Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight, there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run, which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market. This winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 MMcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of 4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November, with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching. Supply-The Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the soaring gas-related rig count. * The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in 2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam play. * Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews. Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February, with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline. Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again, this time until December 1. Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf per day. During November that total should climb to 750 MMcf per day, despite the later published start date. With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast, differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA expects a December average differential of $0.25 per MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average $0.20 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per MMBtu for December. * Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15 per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices $0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at $5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000 MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's weather be colder than normal, we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000. These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized. Canadian Markets-Winter Begins The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East. Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf below the five-year average. Even with modest withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs. Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well above the five-year average. With the eastward movement of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin. This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada. The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal ""freeze-up,"" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year. Further Delays for Alliance? The ""commercial"" in-service date for Alliance has been delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line, delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant, the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up since September. It is estimated that flows for November will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year- over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern Canada. High Prices: Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a result of this increased pull. For December, the differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.10 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this message with associated Tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Western Undeterred By Grueling Regulatory Process Expressing frustration but continuing its resolve, Texas-based Western Hub Properties is ironing out some ""technical issues"" of financing with California regulators and now expects to start construction in February on its delayed Lodi gas storage field in northern California. The merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year, said Western Hub's California-based manager, Jim Fossum, who added that with faster approvals, the project could have been in service during this summer's electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages. Despite the regulatory struggle, he said the company still plans to go through with its other California storage project near Bakersfield and the natural gas hub called Wheeler Ridge. Western has acquired leases on the property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed site over the first three to six months of next year. The company intends to make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001. In both the approved Lodi project (see Daily GPI, May 19) and the proposed Wheeler Ridge storage field, Western is not concerned about lining up customers, said Fossum. The projects are not contingent on contracts, he said. ""Now that we are a bona fide (certified plant) utility under the California Public Utilities Commission, we are getting some technical things worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces 
El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection program.

Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which is in dire need of new power generation. The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer 2003. Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process recently enacted by the California legislature. Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition, construction management and operation of global power production facilities. The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand,

In a letter last month (see Daily GPI, Oct. 19), Northwest announced a policy revision allowing a shipper holding capacity from Sumas to off-system delivery points to amend primary delivery points and shorten the path without being subject to a contractual OFO upon extending its contract term. However, citing ""the current OFO situation on the pipeline system,"" Northwest said last week the policy change is under review and has been suspended until further notice. El Paso reported Thursday an injection unit at its Washington Ranch storage facility had gone down for emergency maintenance. Capacity through Pecos River Station has been reduced by 100 MMcf/d until further notice, causing the pipeline to impose allocations on Permian Basin production and deliveries of San Juan Basin gas to the South Mainline. El Paso said work on Lines 1106 and 1107 was extended by one more day, causing the shut-in of deliveries into El Paso at the IUTBENED and IHYBENDM interconnects to continue through Dec. 1. The delay also postpones scheduled work on Line 3137, which now will be shut in Dec. 4-5, affecting the IVALEROZ, ISONORA, ISHOZONA and IBARNHRT points. Line 3177 is scheduled for Dec. 7 inspection, affecting IMOBILPE.

But the meetings did serve to highlight divisions within the three negotiating blocks and identify the most contentious areas for future discussion. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/22/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Hitting Retail Energy Over the Net: e-Commerce Companies Join the Game Author: Robertson, Behrens, Biehl E-Mail Category: Private Report Product Line: Retail Energy Forum,Energy & e-Business URL: For Retail Energy Retainer Service members: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/ref/pr/062100_12/ref_pr_062100_12_ab.html For e2 Business Retainer Service members: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/e2/pr/062100_12/e2_pr_062100_12_ab.html Summary: The retail energy industry and the Internet are becoming increasingly interlinked. The past 12 months have seen the formation of a wave of new retail energy businesses seeking ways to utilize the Internet to create a ""new"" retail energy industry. The difference is that this ""new"" industry will invert the energy supply chain and be built from the demand side (customer end) back upstream. This fosters a new role for customers and their relationship with suppliers, an expansion in the number and types of products and services being offered, and a change in the composition of the companies involved in this segment. In this Private Report we analyze these new entrants, their business models, and the prospects for success in what to date has been a difficult marketplace. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/02/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Turkish Parliament Votes on the Blue Stream Tax Protocol Author: Vatansever E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Eurasia Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/fsu/alt/060200_17/fsu_alt_060200_17_ab.html Summary: The last remaining obstacle to the Blue Stream gas pipeline project between Russia and Turkey appears about to be cleared away. Over the past two days the Turkish parliament has been debating a key tax protocol connected to the project. CERA believes the measure is very close to passage, as the Turkish governing coalition has successfully resolved its internal differences over Blue Stream. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: More Oil Is Coming into the Black Sea: Will It Cause a Bosphorus Crisis? Author: Gustafson E-Mail Category: Private Report Product Line: Eurasia Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/fsu/pr/062300_15/fsu_pr_062300_15_ab.html Summary: Crude volumes transiting through the Bosphorus will soon build rapidly as new Caspian pipelines come online. This Private Report by CERA Director Thane Gustafson explores how the increased costs and risks of shipping oil through the Bosphorus will be handled. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/16/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: European Green Energy: Let the Market Decide Author: de La Tournelle E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: European Power URL: http://www.cera.com/client/ep/alt/061600_15/ep_alt_061600_15_ab.html Summary: The proposed directive on renewables issued by the European Commission on May 10 may appear to be a weak compromise between widely divergent interests. Rather, CERA sees the proposal as a potentially important building block for a competitive market in renewable energy sources; the establishment of a method for guaranteeing a renewable origin for energy lays the foundation for green energy markets in the medium term. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/05/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Pastrana: Facing the Sunset? Author: Puyana, Scott E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/db/060500_11/la_db_060500_11_ab.html Summary: Colombia is expected to begin an economic recovery in 2000 after a contraction of over 5 percent in 1999. Despite this expansion, unemployment levels will remain stable at 19 percent, and losses incurred by companies, by individuals, and by the government through lower tax revenues during the last nine quarters of negative economic growth will not be recovered this year. The administration of Andr,s Pastrana Arango faces the difficult challenge of getting the economy back in shape at a time when his popularity is waning. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/09/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: ANP Round Two: Brazil's Upstream Auction? Author: Scott, Mattos E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/060900_16/la_alt_060900_16_ab.html Summary: The opening of Brazil's upstream oil sector has taken another step forward this week following the successful ANP auction of 21 blocks. This bidding round comes one year after ANP's first round, held in June 1999. The bid was well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in Brazil. Although the ANP collected lower participation fees than in the first round (US$9.0 million compared with US$9.8 million in the first round), the second round was generally considered a success. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/16/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Brazilian Power Markets: Demand Recovery Gathers Steam but Supply Questions Remain Author: Bailey, Mattos E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/061600_17/la_alt_061600_17_ab.html Summary: Brazil's power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000. February demand was 6.8 percent over February 1999 levels, and March demand grew a further 7.6 percent above the previous year. The industrial sector continued to lead the recovery with year-to-date demand growing 9.8 percent over 1999, and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7.5 percent over a similar period. As demand growth strengthened, hydro power generation increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in January. Hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by the end of April, signaling the end of the wet season. With rapidly increasing demand, particularly in the South and Southeast regions, Brazil could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several months are delayed. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Mexico after the Elections: The Real Battle Begins Author: Puyana E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/db/062000_12/la_db_062000_12_ab.html Summary: For the first time in many decades, the presidential and parliamentary campaigns are highly competitive, and the results of these democratically conducted elections will have a large impact on the effectiveness and future of the new administration. However, the real political battle begins after the elections. Indeed, the winning party will have to exercise all its political skills to create coalitions and advance negotiations in order to take control of the government. Three different scenarios are portrayed in this CERA Decision Brief. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/26/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Colombia: Weary of War, Wary of Peace Author: Puyana, Scott E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/db/062600_10/la_db_062600_10_ab.html Summary: July 2000 marks the second anniversary of the widely publicized visit of then President-elect Andres Pastrana to elderly guerilla chief of the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC), Manuel Marulanda. Two years later, the country is no closer to peace, and resolution of the ongoing negotiations is uncertain at best. This prolongation and stagnation of the peace process has had a direct negative impact on energy sector investment in Colombia. The government will likely proceed with formal negotiations, but time--and Pastrana's remaining term in office--is running out. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/30/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Argentine Power Markets: Winter Constraints Push Prices Higher in May Author: Bailey E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://www.cera.com/client/la/alt/063000_16/la_alt_063000_16_ab.html Summary: Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing to the combination of continued low hydro output, strong demand growth, and periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos Aires region. Spot power prices (energy component only) averaged $18.24 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in May. Although average power prices declined from last year, price volatility increased, with several short-duration episodes of prices over $60 per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region forced several midcost units offline during peak hours. In June, prices are expected to continue strengthening to the $24-$28 per MWh range on average. Beyond June, price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing hydro output, new and returning low-cost thermal capacity, and the end of gas constraints push average prices back toward $15 per MWh or below by August or September. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/01/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: US Gas Markets Reach New Heights: Where Will It Stop? Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/060100_15/nag_alt_060100_15_ab.html Summary: The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as $4.50 per MMBtu--up from less than $3.00 per MMBtu during April. Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply, the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation. The gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories, with injections so far this spring running between 1.5 and 2.0 Bcf per day below last year's rate. The continued tension between these two forces will keep the pressure on prices this summer, and the need to inject gas into storage will price out increments of demand. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/alt/061500_16/nag_alt_061500_16_ab.html Summary: Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factors--the increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound--call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. Prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years. In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer--with pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise--with the result that gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use demand. CERA expects a July average price of $4.45 per MMBtu. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Western Canada Supply Growth: Getting Nowhere Faster Author: Eynon, Small E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/db/061500_18/nag_db_061500_18_ab.html Summary: As US supply declines and demand grows, current high gas prices are reinforced, but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering when it is needed most. Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie the disappointing production growth results. The largely weather-related transitory factors have had a near-term impact on drilling and connection activity. The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time. More shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well production rates. Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace production. With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling, higher supply growth rates are possible, but if that does not occur, other potential supply sources may step in. Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight. Coal bed methane has become a str! ong source of US supply. Although now ignored in Canada, it may become a future source of Canadian gas. ********************************************************************** CERA Watch : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Reaching New Heights Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Watch Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/wch/061600_11/nag_wch_061600_11_ab.html Summary: Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the development of spot markets. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/21/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Closing the Utility Stock Valuation Gap: Does Strategy Matter? Author: Parshley E-Mail Category: Private Report Product Line: North American Power URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/pr/062000_14/nap_pr_062000_14_ab.html Summary: The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility industry. Traditionally undervalued in the market, the sector is trading at a historically wide 50 percent discount to Standard and Poor's S&P 500. The S&P Utility Index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent, with huge gains by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 electric utilities. Yet early this year, the SPU outpaced all other industry groups. How should constantly evolving utilities in this wide-open sector form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success? The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999--a record $50 billion--was double the 1998 value. But are these choices ahead of the curve? And when will the market catch up? Three groups of new companies with distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape: multiservice and technology providers, superregionals, and global power and ! energy companies. Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating responses to these challenges. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Summer 2000 Spot Electricity Markets Outlook: Divergent Trends in Price Volatility Author: Makovich, Sannicandro E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: North American Power URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/db/062200_18/nap_db_062200_18_ab.html Summary: While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price spikes this summer, other markets are likely to see a reversal in price volatility as supply-demand balances improve dramatically. One way to interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations. Therefore, forward prices for on-peak wholesale power reflect the common expectation that prices will spike as high as--or even higher than--in 1999. A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/02/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Atlantic Basin Gasoline Markets Soar Author: Meyers E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/rp/alt/060200_17/rp_alt_060200_17_ab.html Summary: Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season, spot gasoline-to-crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War. In CERA's view, this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors: very low inventories, tightening gasoline specifications, and legal uncertainty. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/13/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products Line--US Markets Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/061300_18/rp_alt_061300_18_ab.html Summary: The US gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during May. US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline surged to $8.40 per barrel measured against WTI, up $3.58 per barrel over the strong April value of $4.82. Apparent demand for gasoline skyrocketed to 8.64 million barrels per day (mbd) in response to the start of the summer driving season. Despite increases in the reported demand for distillate and jet/kerosene, these markets did not experience the same month-over-month strength in differentials, dropping to $1.58 and $2.58 per barrel versus WTI, respectively. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products Line--European Markets Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/062000_14/rp_alt_062000_14_ab.html Summary: As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials to Brent and thus lower refinery margins, refiners attempted to prevent this situation from worsening by reducing throughputs. However, very tight markets for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the fall in those products' values. Meanwhile, fuel oil discounts to crude oil widened in May, driving down simple/hydroskimming margins. In recent weeks, the combination of lower primary products inventories and reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to recover. This has pushed margins to above May's averages, although still below April's peaks. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/26/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Recent Actions Signal Progress Toward MTBE Elimination Author: Stackpole E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/rp/alt/062600_16/rp_alt_062600_16_ab.html Summary: The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline (RFG) now faces from the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) use in the US gasoline pool. Additional signposts, including heightened congressional debate over legislation eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE, continue to emerge that point the way toward MTBE-free gasoline in the United States. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/29/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products: Market Update Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/062900_16/rp_alt_062900_16_ab.html Summary: Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences. In the Atlantic Basin, low gasoline inventories in both the United States and Europe, which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint, continue to dominate the market, and gasoline differentials above crude are at their highest level in over ten years. Although signs are emerging of a possible correction in the North American market in the coming month, the 2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by Atlantic Basin refiners in many years. In contrast, Asia Pacific spot refining margins were weak through most of June, until the recent accident at KPC's Mina al-Ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt Singapore margins. However, with ample unused refining capacity available east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in July, CERA's outlook is for that strength to be of short duration. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: New Peaks, New Prices Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/ce/alt/062300_17/ce_alt_062300_17_ab.html Summary: In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and steadily rising power prices. CERA expect the West to be the only region in North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. The convergence of higher gas prices, growing power demand, and reduced hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up western power prices. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer ! power loads. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Oil Market Turmoil: OPEC Seeks a Short-term Fix Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/061500_18/wo_alt_061500_18_ab.html Summary: Driven by strong demand--especially in the recovering Asian economies and the United States--oil prices (both WTI and Brent) have again broken the $30 level--a mark that is of particular significance in this US election year. In turn, the oil market's attention is again fixed on OPEC, as it prepares for its June 21 meeting, but its members are deeply divided over how to respond. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/16/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The State of the Oil Market: Market Supported, Psychology Enhanced, and OPEC Driven Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/061600_19/wo_alt_061600_19_ab.html Summary: The key ingredient in the volatile oil market is the new OPEC--and its successful implementation of a strategy to keep supply one half step behind demand-driving inventories down for crude, with the side effect of lowering stocks for several products in markets such as the United States and Europe. Three features of the current oil market are supporting prices: * Market supported * Psychology enhanced * OPEC driven ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/22/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: OPEC's Cautious New Agreement Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/062200_16/wo_alt_062200_16_ab.html Summary: OPEC's agreement to raise its production quota beginning July 1 by 708,000 barrels per day to 25.4 million barrels per day is consistent with its strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low levels. The gain in supply is a short-term fix meant to alleviate political pressure for increased production and to push prices below $30 but keep them in a mid- to upper $20s range. **end** Follow URL for HTML Version of this message only.

Transportation Notes Projecting that linepack would slip below its minimum target level through Thursday, Pacific Gas & Electric issued a systemwide Stage 3 OFO, effective today until further notice. The order carries penalties of $5/Dth for negative daily imbalances exceeding a 3% tolerance. As a result of warmer area weather and banking on its system, Northwest said it is operationally feasible to loosen conditions of its entitlement for delivery points north of Kemmerer (WY) Station. A Declared Stage II (8% tolerance) Overrun Entitlement will take effect today; through Tuesday the pipeline was in a Stage I (3%) Entitlement. A shipper is subject to penalties for overtakes north of Kemmerer that exceed an amount 8% greater than its confirmed nominations. El Paso will take the B turbine at Cornudas Station in West Texas down for maintenance today and Thursday, reducing South Mainline capacity there by 60 MMcf/d. However, Cornudas capacity has not been fully utilized recently, the pipeline said, so this reduction should not affect current markets. The Kinder Morgan pipeline group (NGPL, Kinder Morgan Interstate, Trailblazer, Canyon Creek, KN Wattenburg and TransColorado) reminded shippers it has a new 24-hour hotline phone number for information and questions about point confirmations and related issues: (713) 369-9683. The old hotline will stay in service through Dec. 31, but callers will hear a recording giving the new number. The current number for nomination-related issues, (713) 369-9670,

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market. NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis market. ""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is scheduled for completion in June of 2002. NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the area. ""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season will determine the final scope of the project. ""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the Houston audience. ""In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry,"" he said, pointing to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things upside down. When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy companies are now adopting that method. In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy industry. ""We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom of this synopsis, the web site address  will direct you to the full report released today if you would like further information. EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from $2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's latest report. EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for about half the change in energy projections. EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. ""In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases

This is approximately 5.0 Bcf per day higher than the previously expected withdrawal rate under normal weather conditions. The result is that storage inventories as of the end of the month are about 500 Bcf below the year-earlier level and are on track to dip well into record low territory by the end of the winter (see Table 1). For December, normal weather would result in storage withdrawals of 17.0 Bcf per day on average for the month. At that rate, storage inventories would fall below 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the year, the first time that has ever occurred. By the end of March CERA expects working inventories to be reduced to 606 Bcf in the United States, compared with the previous record low of 758 Bcf. This weather and high withdrawal rates have moved prices higher within the wide and volatile range between residual fuel oil and distillate, with gas prices moving farther above those of resid ($4.75 to $5.00) and closer to the price of distillate fuel oil (approximately $7.00). Strength in the oil market has kept the resid-distillate range high, but should gas test either boundary of this range, the price of either distillate or resid would move as well. Under normal weather CERA now expects December prices to average $6.25 at the Henry Hub, a higher level within this range reflective of reduced storage inventories. Although prices have abated somewhat in recent days and will continue to rise and fall with weather and weather forecasts, fundamentals now are so tight that a return to cold weather would quickly drive prices back above $6.50 and potentially above $7.00 at the Henry Hub. It is only at that level or above that any significant additional demand response is likely, and even then such a response would require time. The possibility of curtailments of interruptible loads late this winter has grown, while the possibility of significant price relief appears increasingly remote. **end** Follow URL for HTML version of this message with associated Table. ********************************************************* Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, ""Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future"" in Houston, February 12-16, 2001!

El Paso Puts Off Maintenance to Meet CA Demand 
Distributed Power: The Next Big Investment? With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters. With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the ""next big investment opportunity for the coming decade."" In Winters' 250 page report, ""Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: Set for a Revolution-Part 2,"" he examines technologies and companies within the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage of the current situation. ""Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in the early 1980's,"" said Winters. ""Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of high quality, reliable power,"" added Winters. According to his research, microturbines are the best positioned of the ""new"" technologies that would be able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, efficient and very versatile. ""They can be used as a main power source, a back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in traditional energy prices,"" the analyst said. ""Microturbines can also be used in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access to electricity."" Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other fuels as well. In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering flywheel technology, as a ""buy"" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading manufacturer of microturbines, as ""attractive."" The companies are in addition to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Update from CERA on pricing and rest of the season. 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, December 08, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Storm Arrives Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/120800_16/nag_alt_120800_16_ab.html ********************************************************* Cold Weather Path Colder-than-normal weather through November and forecasted cold for the first half of December throughout the Midwest and Northeast have driven gas prices well into record territory, with the January Henry Hub price trading near $9.00 per MMBtu and closing above $8.00 on the New York Mercantile Exchange December 6. This six-week cold period and the quick depletion of already low storage inventories has established prices at or above CERA's cold weather path for the remainder of the winter and in all likelihood beyond. If December storage withdrawals are as high as CERA now expects, the gas market will remain on the cold weather path through 2001 as well, even if weather returns to normal during the second half of December. The enormous increase in storage injections that is likely to be required next summer would keep the pressure on gas markets throughout the year. So long as weather remains cold (or even normal) this winter, a new market dynamic is in effect in which gas prices interact more with distillate fuel oil prices rather than with those of residual fuel oil. In addition, gas is likely to have an increasingly direct influence on power prices in the growing number of regions in which gas-fired generation is now on the margin in winter. This winter, the gas market is likely to rediscover for the first time in decades which end users value natural gas most highly, and which ultimately do not. The gas market is also rediscovering the value of firm pipeline capacity, particularly into market areas. Both the West Coast and the Northeast have experienced even more extreme price spikes, with daily prices in both regions peaking above $20.00 per MMBtu. Indeed, the shortage of gas in California is so acute that prices above $40.00 per MMBtu have been reported. If sustained, these price levels will induce a political reaction that will reverberate throughout the industry. Storage Update-Even High Seems Low Panic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat as storage withdrawals for the week ending December 1, at 73 billion cubic feet (Bcf), proved to be less than expected. This withdrawal was half the previous week's rate, and in CERA's view actual withdrawals for both weeks probably lie between these two readings. (In some cases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings in the AGA survey.) But even the 73 Bcf figure, though a significant retreat from the previous week's rate, is high by historical standards. One would have to go back to 1994 to find a higher reading for a comparable week in the AGA survey. Inventories as of the beginning of December, at an estimated 2,466 Bcf (see Table 1), were 525 Bcf below the year-earlier level, and this deficit is likely to increase substantially during December. If weather forecasts indicating colder-than-normal weather through mid-December in key heating markets hold true, storage withdrawals for the month will average approximately 20.0 Bcf per day. This rate is an increase from CERA's normal weather estimate of 17.0 Bcf per day, and even this rate depends on weather returning to normal in mid- December. This level of withdrawals would leave only 1,846 Bcf in storage on January 1, an inventory 663 Bcf below the year-earlier level. Assuming normal weather, such an inventory would place storage on track to reach a March minimum of 488 Bcf, 270 Bcf below the 1996 record low. At a US inventory level this low, many storage operators would be dipping into base-load gas in order to support service even to firm gas customers. * Physical deliverability from storage fields will be significantly lower this year in midwinter, forcing a greater reliance on pipeline gas and peaking facilities during January and February. The actual reduction in field deliverability is impossible to quantify, but storage inventories cannot be withdrawn at steady rates throughout the winter; withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced. *  Pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through 2001 and probably into 2002. During the past two summers, high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall US storage injections to reach barely 1.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). If normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter, 2.2 Tcf of injections-which would be nearly impossible to achieve-would be required during 2001 if inventories are to recover to 2.7 Tcf at peak. If weather this winter is merely normal from mid-December through March, going into winter next year the United States will have considerably less gas in storage. Reaching even the 2,362 Bcf level, according to CERA estimates (see Table 1), would require an additional 275 Bcf of injections next year, and that alone would prove challenging. Price-The Cold Weather Path The weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above CERA's cold weather path for this winter (see Table 2). Storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through mid-December proves accurate, and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense. For these reasons CERA's outlook for prices for January and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold weather path.  Prices could take an even higher path, particularly if colder-than-normal weather endures beyond mid-December or returns on a sustained basis in January or February. Several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will begin to enter the market during the winter, but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over. Such factors include a building US supply capability, growing imports, softening oil prices (allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends), and potentially weakening economic growth. Although the influence of these factors will increase, it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer. Demand-The Difficult Next Round of Switching With gas prices hitting new record highs, CERA expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market. Because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since May, however, the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred. Even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate (approximately $7.23 per MMBtu in New York), switching from gas to distillate requires changes in long-standing consumer habit, will occur only over time, and is likely limited in volume. Significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself. There are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets: * Additional switching to resid in industrial boilers. The next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector, through additional fuel switching to resid (and to some extent to distillate). These markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume. CERA estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts (less than 0.5 Bcf per day) in switching to resid, given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than $0.50 per MMBtu. * Investment in restoring switching capability. As premiums move far beyond this level, industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial short-term levels. However, such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets. CERA estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year, switching to resid could eventually reach as high as 1.3 Bcf per day. There is already some movement here; given the impact of high gas prices on earnings, energy prices have already begun to receive management attention. * Switching to distillate. US Department of Energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly 1.3 Bcf per day to distillate in the short term. This switch would represent additional distillate demand of over 200,000 barrels per day (bd) in a US market of 3.8 million barrels. This marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price, and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation. In addition, the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a long-term solution to tight markets. * Shutting down industrial plants. Also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock. The major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries, and, not surprisingly given the tight margins available, manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand. However, in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk. Whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the Gulf Coast is relatively readily replaced by imports, substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast (because of transportation logistics) and for facilities whose production is linked to value-added fertilizer products. Hence, CERA still estimates that even with nonexistent margins, substantial ammonia production would continue, with additional losses of perhaps 200 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed. Extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of North American methanol capacity, putting at risk another 100 to 200 MMcf per day of gas demand for that sector. Switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals, paper, and refining sectors in the South and the food products sector in the Midwest. Continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the South Central region. For process users, even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term. Energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users, and a physical changeover would be time-intensive and elemental in its impact on end-use product quality. The Northeast-Cold Weather Operations Begin All of the Northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed, or are highly likely to need to impose, transportation restrictions of various types. The most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services (secondary and interruptible type services), which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines. Other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match. Even hourly flow orders have also been implemented. These actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected. Whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions, the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up. The spot market, primarily made up of nonfirm customers, has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area, as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week. The result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to Henry Hub. At one point, gas for next-day delivery to New York traded near $24.00 per MMBtu delivered, although the average price was closer to $14.20. These high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas. Although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal, CERA now expects basis into the New York citygate to average $1.31 per MMBtu for December and $1.36 per MMBtu for January. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated tables. ********************************************************* Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, ""Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future"" in Houston, February 12-16, 2001!

High Prices Force Chemicals to Sell Gas, Futures Chemical companies, forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices, are nevertheless making money --- by selling gas futures contracts. Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp. became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs. Iowa-based Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December natural gas purchases, and shutdown 50% of its Verdigis, OK, ammonia facility. The company had previously reported that it would not operate its Bytheville, AR, and Beaumont, TX, facilities during the month of December as well. In a similar maneuver, Mississippi Chemical Corp., a producer of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium-based products in Mississippi, Louisiana and New Mexico, reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from January forward, in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices. Mississippi Chemical said it expects to realize a pre-tax gain of $16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31 from the recently sold contracts. The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices. An overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low, while gas prices, a feedstock for some chemicals, continue to climb. The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products, said Ron Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute. Duke Energy's Ken Nyiri, divisional director of strategic planning and research, commented on Mississippi Chemical's transactions, ""I guess they probably made about a $4/MMBtu margin on the gas, which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia; in fact, they would have lost $30/unit. Their ammonia was probably costing them about $205/ton to make (with gas bought at $5/MMBtu in November) and the market today is at $205 so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs. By selling the gas at around $9/MMBtu they made $4/MMBtu. It was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it, or do they sell the gas

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Thu, June 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1230 , Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market, as three factors-increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound-call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. As strong as gas market fundamentals are, gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years.  In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer-with pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise-and gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use demand. The $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) increase in gas prices since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users. First, gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the East Coast, and gas will likely lose approximately 600 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer. Second, several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down. Equally telling, however, is that heat in any one region of the country-most recently the West-is all that is required to sustain gas prices above $4.00 at the Henry Hub, despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets. Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive. For these reasons CERA expects prices to average $4.45 at the Henry Hub during July (see Table 1), and even greater volatility is ! possible. The intense competition and need to price out end-use demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above $5.00 per MMBtu amid heat waves this summer. Gas Storage-Injections Increase, but Little Relief Yet The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages, with the American Gas Association (AGA) reporting 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of injections during each of the weeks ending June 2 and 9. However, these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to 400 Bcf on a year-over-year basis, and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks, or even months, to come. As temperatures rise through the end of the month, injections are likely to slow, so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of approximately 10 Bcf per day. The deficit that stood at an estimated 394 Bcf as of the end of May (see Table 2), on an inventory level of approximately 1,454 Bcf, is expected to rise slightly during June, to 403 Bcf, despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month. With US wellhead supply still running an estimated 0.5 to 1.0 Bcf per day below year-earlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting this decline, even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task. Each month in which this 400 Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October. Injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this pattern to reverse in a significant way, an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions. Regional Markets With the exception of the Rocky Mountains, western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region. This strong demand is pulling supplies from the Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California. Prices at the California border have been particularly strong, averaging over a $0.30 premium to the Henry Hub so far this month. Continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through July, as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines. In addition, the early heat waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus, although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: *  Rockies. Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region. High utilization rates on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer. CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry Hub of $0.55 per MMBtu. *  San Juan. The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub, and this West Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer. CERA expects a differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of $0.16 per MMBtu during July. *  Permian and Mid-Continent. As Texas power loads increase, the competition from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify. Permian differentials, which have been averaging around $0.15 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub, should narrow. CERA expects a $0.06 per MMBtu differential for July. Mid-Continent supplies should price just below Permian supplies, at an $0.08 per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub. *  Chicago. Chicago differentials continue to trade around $0.05 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub, and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials, ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure. CERA expects a July differential of $0.06 per MMBtu. *  Northeast. New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer, namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of $4.00 gas. The result has been differentials above $0.30 from Transco Station 65 but closer to $0.30 from the Henry Hub. As power generation load reaches its peak, however, differentials can rise even in summer. Short-lived power load peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the $0.40s, but for the month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average $0.34. Canadian Markets-Demand Still Down Canadian demand continues to be down on a year-over-year basis. Volumes on TransCanada Pipeline are 400 MMcf below levels at this time last year, and Alberta demand is 200 MMcf below; both of these reductions are primarily storage related. Weak storage injections, driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summer-winter price spread, continue to place inventories further behind 1999 levels. Although inventories are still well above the five-year average, unless injections increase, it is more likely that end-of-season inventories will be comparable to the five-year average (450 Bcf) rather than to 1999 levels (484 Bcf). Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year. Thus far in June, flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to 1999, while PG&E GT-NW is currently operating 300 MMcf higher. Demand on the West Coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer. Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with 1999 levels. An outage pattern similar to last year's has emerged. TCE/NOVA has had maintenance projects ongoing in June, but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds. Thus far in June, reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as 850 MMcf but should average 300 MMcf for the month. Even though June is expected to be flat year-over-year, the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than 1999 maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred. Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year, largely in the fourth quarter, as a result of the increased level of drilling. The annual average supply is expected to be around 100 MMcf per day higher than in 1999 as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and modest growth in British Columbia (again primarily later in the year), as well as the new production from! Ft. Liard that is now onstream. The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada. AECO is expected to average C$5.15 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.69 per MMBtu) for June with a differential in the low US$0.60s. July is expected to average C$5.44 per GJ (US$3.90 per MMBtu). The Henry-to-AECO differential is likely to remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand.

American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Watch Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1235 , Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the development of spot markets. **end** Follow URL for complete report.

Predictions of Fuel Switching 
High Prices Put a Damper on Industrial Demand Gas producers must be wringing their hands in glee as futures prices top $4.45/MMBtu, but some of their customers clearly are a little less than overjoyed. High gas prices are forcing some fertilizer producers to consider shutting down their plants and selling their feedstock on the open market just to make ends meet. WEFA Inc. energy analyst Ron Denhardt estimates the gas industry will lose 25% (400 MMcf/d) of demand from the ammonia and urea industry this year because of the high price of natural gas. Other observers are expecting much larger losses, reaching as high as 1.5 Bcf/d. Denhardt also estimates the loss of an additional 1-2 Bcf/d due to fuel switching in the power production sector and possibly another 2.2 Bcf/d as industrial end users switch over to fuel oil. But those numbers are dependent on the comparative price of Nos. 1 and 2 fuel oil, both of which currently exceed the price of natural gas per Btu. ""Chemical and fertilizer companies who have hedged their gas supplies are better off shutting down their plants right now and selling the gas into the market,"" said one chemical plant supply manager, who asked to remain anonymous. ""It's terrible. It's awful. About 70% of my contracts for sale are pass-through based on the cost of raw materials, and that's the only thing that is keeping me in business right now. We would not be making cost right now otherwise. We might be at a break-even point. And we hedged about 40% of our purchases back in September of last year, which was a pretty good time, looking back right now. We just have to plan it day by day.

NGPL Recontracts with NIPSCO Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter. Since Kinder Morgan took over NGPL parent KN Energy last year, the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the Midwest, including another deal announced yesterday with Northern Indiana Public Service (NIPSCO). NGPL and NIPSCO signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling 295,100 MMBtu/d of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and Dec. 1, 2001 and continuing through Nov. 30, 2002. They also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling 10.5 Bcf of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001 and continuing through March 31, 2003. NIPSCO, a NiSource subsidiary, is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly 700,000 customers and electricity to 416,000 customers across the northern third of Indiana. ""Virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year,"" said NGPL President Deborah Mcdonald in an interview. ""Basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year. We've been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [NiGas, NIPSCO and Peoples]."" Despite increasing competitive pressure from Northern Border and Alliance Pipeline, the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators. ""In contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the Midcontinent and Louisiana to Chicago, we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core LDCs. Obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with Aquila Energy for 500,000 MMBtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts,"" Mcdonald said. ""We also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power generators. Growth in NGPL will come from natural gas-fired generation. You probably saw our press release about the Ameren contracts for [construction of 1,700 MW of generation along the NGPL system]. In the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3,000 MW of gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 MW next year as well [which would represent up to 900 MMcf/d in gas transportation capacity]. ""Obviously another challenge is going to be [the 1.325 Bcf/d] Alliance Pipeline coming into the market this fall. It's anyone's guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time. I think a lot of that will be coming into Chicago and moving back out on Vector. But we're ready at Hub America to kind of serve as a giant header system [with Texas Eastern as 
NEW POWER PLANT ADDED TO PNM SYSTEM PNM, Public Service Company of New Mexico, now has an additional 132 megawatts of electricity available to help meet peak summer demand.  A new gas-fired generating plant, Delta-Person Station, is now fully operational in Albuquerque, PNM announced this week.

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Wed, July 26, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The West: Keeping Its Fingers Crossed Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1286 , A strong dose of summer weather in June propelled West-wide demand levels up by nearly 12 percent over the same period in 1999. These higher demand levels provided the year's first example of the power price spikes that can be produced when the West's tight capacity intersects with normal summer load levels, lower-than-normal hydroelectric levels, strong gas prices, and California's immature wholesale power market structure. As power markets reacted in June with unprecedented price strength throughout the region, regulators and the California Independent System Operator (ISO) intervened to dampen markets from a maximum of $750 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to $500 per MWh.* Although some market participants have filed protests at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to raise or eliminate the caps, utilities, legislators, and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market. As western markets move through the critical July-August peak electricity demand period, market participants and regulators alike are wondering if power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in June. CERA expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer weather conditions, barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages. However, normal August weather conditions will push demand levels significantly higher than in June, creating an even tighter supply-demand balance, straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key demand regions adequately. A hot weather event could exhaust both in-state and imported supplies for California. The tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong price response, similar to that in June. This will fuel the unease of regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that are considering restructuring. Even as regulators' continued support of restructured power markets begins to waver, a weather event that forces regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene. CERA's outlook for August power markets is driven by * High peak loads. Under normal weather conditions, West-wide August loads will be on average 1,400 megawatts (MW) higher than last August. The peak load in California is expected to push capacity margins to 6 percent, even after curtailing interruptible load. * Lower hydroelectric output. As the West enters its peak load period, hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly 3,900 average megawatts (aMW) from July to August. Compared with the high, sustained output of last August, hydroelectric output this August, although roughly average on a historical basis, will be roughly 4,900 aMW (20 percent) lower. * High levels of gas-fired generation. Compared with August 1999, higher utilization rates, along with gas prices that have climbed $1.88 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), will increase the incremental cost of energy production by over $20 per MWh. Although CERA expects power prices in August to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness, higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all periods of the day. The extremely tight power supply-demand balance within the West, and within California specifically, has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand for power generation. This high demand level-combined with seasonal storage injection needs in California-has pushed up utilization rates on pipelines into California and pushed Topock differentials over $0.75 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub. Strong demand should continue through August in the West and support premium pricing at Topock. The Rocky Mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed on Topock deliveries. In the Rockies supply is building relative to export pipeline capacity, and market access is becoming a challenge. Weak seasonal demand compounds the problem; the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the Rockies. Generation within the region remains nearly all coal-fired. These regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through September. Moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the Henry Hub. However, summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels. Higher gas prices are likely to resurface. Regional Power Market Drivers August demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional 7 percent, or nearly 5,500 aMW, over average June levels (see Table 1). Peak demand levels should exceed those in June as well, with a coincident peak over the whole Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) of 118,600 MW expected under normal weather conditions in 2000, a 2.7 percent increase over the weather-muted 1999 peak. California alone should experience peak loads that are approximately 3,600 MW higher than peak levels in June. Available generation capacity in the West has been at normal levels for this time of year, although coal-fired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but short-lived outages. The steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove 3,900 aMW from the West resource base when compared with July levels and about 6,800 aMW since June, although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of June. Given hydro operators' economic interest in maximizing on-peak production at the expense of off-peak production, the loss of capacity during the on-peak period will be lower than these levels. August will be a critical month for the heavily import-dependent state of California. While the state will be drawing approximately 7,000 aMW of imports during August to meet demands during peak periods, CERA expects the level of imports to exceed 8,200 MW during peak demand conditions. The Southwest's need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to California, and lower year-over-year hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest will limit exports from that region. Pacific Northwest CERA expects Pacific Northwest demand in August to climb by nearly 1,300 aMW when compared with June levels. The water supply for the Pacific Northwest has declined to 91 percent of normal levels for the Lower Columbia owing to warmer-than-normal weather in June. In addition, normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about 6,000 aMW from the resource base when compared with levels in June (see Table 2). Generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gas-fired generation at high levels. Although less than 4,000 MW of gas-fired generation is currently available in the region, it has been running at high utilization rates. High energy demand in California for Pacific Northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions. As in June, Pacific Northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility CERA expects to occur in California in August. In addition, if hot weather in the Pacific Northwest pressures regional energy reserves, local prices will rise to keep energy in the region, potentially causing prices in the Pacific Northwest to move higher than those to the south. California California is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance. Although hydroelectric output continues to decline, statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly 118 percent of normal. Nevertheless, declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about 730 aMW when compared with hydroelectric production levels in June. Normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about 3,600 aMW over June levels, which were high (see Table 3). California's peak load is expected to exceed 57,000 MW, compared with a peak load in June of approximately 53,500 MW (43,447 MW on the state's ISO system alone, according to its own estimate). Assuming normal plant outage rates, this demand level will necessitate the import of about 8,200 MW of energy to meet the statewide peak. Even after curtailing the approximately 2,800 MW of interruptible load available for tight supply situations, the state has a precarious 6 percent capacity margin during the system peak. An extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional 3,000 MW. Outages are likely if additional imports are not available. A capacity limit of 4,600 MW will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the Pacific Northwest to Northern California. The import limit from the Pacific Northwest to southern California will be 3,100 MW. Rockies and Southwest August demand levels in the combined Rockies/Southwest region will increase only slightly above levels in August 1999, climbing approximately 275 aMW, as loads in the region-unlike the rest of the below-average WSCC-were near normal last August. Even so, August loads will increase demand by over 1,250 aMW when compared with levels in June of this year. As with last year and this June, supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather, although growing loads in the Rockies/Southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions. High loads driven by hot weather will keep the region's prices high. Differentials between the region and California will be tight, but California, having tighter supply-demand balances, will need to price at a premium to attract energy. The high-capacity transmission ties between the Rockies/Southwest and the California market, which is about 150 percent the size of the Rockies/Southwest market, will ensure that prices in the Rockies/Southwest stay close behind California prices whenever loads are high in California. Regional Gas Market Drivers Evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the West, and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures. Since the Northern Border expansion in late 1998, narrow north-south and east-west differentials across pricing points defined the market. This summer, the continuing supply growth in the Rocky Mountains has widened differentials between the Rockies and the rest of the West. At Topock, increasing gas demand in California and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums. Overall in North American gas markets, strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices-from an early July Henry Hub price of $4.50 per MMBtu to under $4.00 per MMBtu. However, despite these high injection rates, the supply-demand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious. Summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices. The ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average Henry Hub price of $4.20 per MMBtu in August. Through the end of the summer, differentials in the West should hold near current levels. The pressure of growing Rocky Mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall. In California high seasonal power loads should continue through August with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation. Demand strength is expected to continue. Across the West, August demand for gas should climb from 9.8 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day in June to 10.4 Bcf per day, buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation (see Table 4). California High gas demand for power generation within California will continue through August. CERA expects an increase from the state's June demand levels of 5.6 Bcf per day to 6.2 Bcf per day during August. The increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads. Total demand is expected to exceed last year's demand level by 1.2 Bcf per day. This will increase flows on pipelines into California, reduce the state's storage surplus, and sustain high prices. CERA expects pipeline utilization rates during August to average 95 percent (see Table 5). CERA expects an August Topock-Henry Hub differential of $0.45 per MMBtu (see Table 6). Pacific Northwest Despite the extremely high prices at Topock and high demand in California, until recently gas at Malin priced at a slight discount to Henry Hub prices. After averaging $0.17 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during the third quarter last year, the differential so far during the third quarter this year is $0.15 per MMBtu below the Hub. This week Malin is pricing at a $0.25 per MMBtu premium relative to the Henry Hub. The Topock-Malin differential has swelled to over $0.60 per MMBtu, signaling intra-California pipeline capacity constraints. Two factors pressured Malin differentials during the early summer. * Pressure on Rocky Mountain and AECO differentials. Prices in the two areas supplying the Pacific Northwest are under some pressure. Increasing supplies in the Rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on Rockies prices by limiting external market access. At AECO, although export capacity out of the province is available, almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern Canada on TransCanada Pipeline. Pipelines into the United States are running near capacity. Because of TransCanada's limited ability to discount interruptible transport, the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled. * Low early summer regional demand. Gas demand in the Pacific Northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output. Even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year, seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in May and June even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in California. Increasing power loads are already evident. The first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the Rockies and western Canada begins climbing. However, gas demand for power generation in the Pacific Northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of July and into August as hydroelectric generation wanes. This added demand-200 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day above June demand levels-will provide some support for Malin prices and limited support for Rockies and AECO prices. Malin-Henry Hub differentials are expected to average $0.05 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price during August. Rocky Mountains Pressure on regional supplies within the Rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs. Differentials to the Henry Hub have widened to over $0.70 per MMBtu and although prices in the rest of the West will gain some support from high power loads, regional demand in the Rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through August. August demand is expected to average 1.2 Bcf per day in the region, approximately equal to June's 1.1 Bcf per day total demand. Demand begins to build during September, but until the heating season begins in October, Rocky Mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the West. CERA expects a Rocky Mountain-Henry Hub differential of $0.60 per MMBtu during August. Although some narrowing in Rocky Mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall, the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during 2001. CERA expects a supply build this year of nearly 300 MMcf per day, followed by a build of over 350 MMcf per day during 2001. Currently, approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region, with the largest increment on Transcolorado into the San Juan Basin. Next summer, all capacity will likely run close to full. Until export pipelines expand-the first likely expansion is Trailblazer-differentials will remain wide. For 2001, CERA expects an average annual differential below the Henry Hub of $0.65 per MMBtu. Southwest Differentials in the San Juan and Permian Basins have gained considerable strength relative to Henry Hub prices amid the recent hot weather in Texas. Permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price, and in the San Juan Basin prices have narrowed from an early July differential of $0.35 per MMBtu to a differential of less than $0.20 per MMBtu. CERA expects demand in the Southwest during August of 1.4 Bcf per day, an increase from June's level of 1.3 Bcf per day, but the larger Texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins. CERA expects a San Juan differential of $0.30 per MMBtu during August, with a Permian Basin differential of $0.06 per MMBtu. Differentials between the Rocky Mountains and the San Juan Basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the Rocky Mountains. Flows on Transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under 20 MMcf per day to over 100 MMcf per day during June. Supply in the two regions is following opposite paths; Rockies supply is climbing rapidly, and San Juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year. CERA expects a decline in supply of 30 MMcf per day during 2000 relative to 1999 and an additional decline of 150 MMcf per day during 2001. Because of these different outlooks, wider Rockies-San Juan differentials will persist. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables.

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, June 23, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: New Peaks, New Prices Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1247 , In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season, which, along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more frequent use of gas-fired generators to meet demand, causes steadily rising power prices. CERA expects the West to be the only region in North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as demand reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. The convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last year's levels, growing demand for power, and reduced hydroelectric energy production when compared with levels in 1999 is pushing up western power prices. Merchant and other gas-fired generators will be pressed into service, experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of 1994. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads. The main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with year-earlier levels will be *  Peak WSCC load season. Summer weather will drive loads to the year's coincident peak, which is most likely to occur during the July/August period but could arrive any time during the June through October air-conditioning season. CERA expects demand growth of 3.1 percent in the third quarter compared with levels in 1999, which will push Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) coincident peak demand levels to 2.7 percent over 1999 levels. *  Waning hydroelectric output. Hydroelectric production is on its normal downward seasonal slide. This resource decline is more visible when compared with the 1999 hydro season, which was both abundant and prolonged. *  High utilization rates for gas-fired generators. Growing demand for electricity, coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy, will drive utilization rates of gas-fired power plants to their highest levels since the drought year of 1994. *  Higher fuel prices. Western gas prices have remained at $1.00-$1.50 per MMBtu above 1999 levels. Growing year-over-year gas demand for power generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets. These higher gas prices provide a boost to both on-peak and off-peak power prices of between $10 and $15 per megawatt-hour (MWh). Regional Power Market Drivers Power markets in the West are poised to break records for demand, peak load, and gas-fired plant utilization and, as a result, power prices. A return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will push demand for electricity up by 5,274 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the US West for the third quarter compared with 1999 levels, or almost 2,400 megawatts (MW) on average (see Table 1). This growth in the demand for electricity will also drive peak loads to new highs. CERA expects the 1999 WSCC coincident peak to be exceeded by 2.7 percent, climbing to nearly 119,000 MW. As was demonstrated by the mild summer of 1999, deviations from normal weather could boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure. Two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric production levels compared with 1999 levels. *  First, CERA expects West-wide total season hydroelectric production in 2000 of roughly 100 percent of historical average levels, substantially lower than the approximately 120 percent of average in 1999. *  Second, runoff was prolonged in 1999, serving to push a substantial portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period (see Figure 1). On average, CERA expects these factors will remove 9,187 GWh, or almost 4,200 average megawatts (aMW), from the western resource base compared with 1999 levels. Exacerbating this decline, refilling of reservoirs and flow restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant curtailments in power production at key Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facilities. Natural gas-fired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the expected increase in demand, while also replacing hydroelectric resources as they continue to decline. This will push average annual utilization rates of gas-fired combined cycle, steam, and cogeneration plants to approximately 38 percent in 2000--levels not experienced since the 41 percent annual average utilization rate in 1994, a year marked by drought and warmer-than-normal summer weather. Utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past 1999 levels, especially this summer. CERA anticipates a West-wide third quarter utilization rate of 59 percent for these facilities under normal summer weather conditions, compared with 46 percent for the same period of 1999. This level of utilization will certainly establish gas-fired generation as the floor to power prices during the third quarter, during not only the on-peak demand period but the off-peak as well. With natural gas prices at $1.00-$1.50 per MMBtu higher than 1999 levels, power prices are boosted by $10-$15 per MWh owing to fuel price increases alone. With supply tightness already evident in western power markets, the stage is set for increased price volatility compared with 1999 levels as episodes of hot weather require increased utilization of less-efficient generators throughout this summer. Pacific Northwest The water supply forecast for the Columbia River remains near average but has dropped a couple percentage points from last month. Flows are expected to remain at roughly 96 percent of average through September on the Lower Columbia and 103 percent of average on the Upper Columbia. Conditions overall are still sufficient to be considered average. This return to normal conditions in the Pacific Northwest should produce hydroelectric output nearly 2,700 GWh (18 percent) lower than last year for July and 8,405 GWh lower for the third quarter as a whole (see Table 2). The region's load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to elevate power prices in the Pacific Northwest relative to 1999 levels. Tighter supply conditions in California and the Southwest will attract energy exports from the Pacific Northwest, preserving a differential between the Pacific Northwest and California of about $1 per MWh on average. Price differentials between the Pacific Northwest and California have varied dramatically recently, with the north at times rising above those to the south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir filling operations. Since the end of May, volatility in both markets has pushed the difference between daily on-peak prices at COB and those in California from a premium of $120 per MWh to a discount of $55 per MWh within a few days. CERA expects that over the long run, California markets will clear at a premium as the summer progresses, but the differential will vary widely, with episodes of Pacific Northwest power pricing at a premium to those in California. California Despite below-average precipitation and snowpack this year, California reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal, ranging between 108 and 166 percent of average for the state's primary runoff regions. Under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly 4 percent (363 GWh) below last year's levels for the third quarter (see Table 2). With a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter 1999, cooling demand this summer will increase most in California, where weather was nearly 30 percent cooler than average last year. Recent day-ahead power prices in California have drawn attention to the West as the highest-cost market (if only temporarily) in North America. Record high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new day-ahead price records, with power prices on June 15 at $457 per MWh in the day-ahead on-peak market and real-time hourly prices at the market cap of $750 per MWh. Increased utilization of gas-fired generation and daily gas prices of around $5 per MMBtu (burner-tip in Southern California) have kept daily average off-peak prices between $40 and $80 per MWh. Notably, these higher price have occurred during periods when roughly 1,800 MW more coal-fire generation was available in the West compared with the same period in 1999. CERA expects prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer. Rockies and Southwest During summer 1999, the Rockies/Southwest was the only region to experience above-average cooling demand, suggesting that normal weather should bring only moderate demand growth of less than 1 percent (see Table 3). However, growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission transfer capability will pull energy from the Rockies/Southwest region when excess capacity is available, ensuring that prices in the region will remain tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the West. Palo Verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets, while maintaining their characteristic premium to the California Power Exchange during spring and early summer. CERA expects Southwest prices to strengthen relative to California when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of demand to the Southwest. However, California prices will maintain a premium on average to those in the Southwest, as the effects of the state's tight supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the Southwest or Pacific Northwest. Regional Gas Market Drivers Under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining supply and increasing gas demand for power generation, gas prices at the Henry Hub are expected to average $4.45 per MMBtu in July. The strong demand for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern half of the West. In the Rockies, pipeline constraints will keep differentials wide. The heightened call on gas demand for power generation, driven by the declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads, is expected to drive demand increases of 1.6 Bcf per day relative to July 1999 and 660 MMcf per day relative to June 2000 demand levels. Gas demand for power generation is expected to reach a monthly average record level of 4.9 Bcf per day in July (see Tables 4 and 5). These increases will result in declines in western storage injection rates and in exports from the West. Both Permian and San Juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the West Coast during July. Low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving North American gas pricing. The West is the one US region actually running a storage surplus, but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas supplies have eroded that surplus, particularly in California (see Table 6). Given the expected increases in gas demand, the western surplus should continue its decline. This decline and very high demand will reinforce the volatility in differentials already evident this summer. California Because of the early hot weather in the West and strong gas demand for power generation, Topock prices have been extremely high and volatile. So far this month, Topock has averaged over $0.30 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub. Flows on El Paso and Transwestern into California increased by over 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day during June relative to May averages, and flows are expected to continue to climb by an additional 400 MMcf per day during July. PGT continues to run near capacity (see Table 7). At the same time, the storage levels within California look likely to fall below last year's levels sometime during the month. This intense demand pressure--California demand should increase by nearly 500 MMcf per day in July relative to June--will keep utilization rates on import pipelines high and sustain Topock differentials. CERA expects the Topock to Henry Hub differential to average $0.30 per MMBtu during July (see Table 8). This high differential will likely persist through the summer, with differentials rising above $0.50 per MMBtu during West Coast heat waves. Southwest San Juan price differentials have been volatile, narrowing during periods of very high western demand. However, a very high utilization rate on pipeline capacity into California has widened the Topock-San Juan differential, and that wide gap is expected to persist. On average, San Juan differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern demand increases with western temperatures. Demand in the Southwest is expected to climb from 1.4 Bcf per day in June to 1.5 Bcf per day in July. This increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in Permian prices should result in an average San Juan differential to the Henry Hub of $0.18 per MMBtu. In the Permian Basin, prices are expected to strengthen as Texas power demand climbs. Combined with the pull on supplies from the West, Permian differentials should narrow from their current levels of $0.20 per MMBtu to below $0.10 per MMBtu. Pacific Northwest Strong June hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest so far this summer, but as hydroelectric output decreases in June and July, gas demand will increase dramatically. CERA expects an increase of nearly 200 MMcf per day during July relative to June levels. The limited demand so far has meant differentials between Malin and the Henry Hub of as much as $0.30 per MMBtu and Topock to Malin differentials of over $0.60 per MMBtu. The Malin to Henry Hub differential has narrowed slightly to around $0.20 per MMBtu. It should continue to strengthen with growth in regional demand and average $0.00 per MMBtu during July. Rocky Mountains Regional gas supply within the Rocky Mountains continues to increase, bolstered by continuing growth in the Powder River Basin. This April, exports out of the Rockies reached 3.2 Bcf per day, a record high. Although there is excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the Southwest on the Transcolorado and Northwest pipelines, high utilization rates have widened Rockies differentials with the rest of the West. In particular, Rockies to San Juan differentials have averaged nearly $0.25 per MMBtu for June after pricing close to parity earlier in the year. That gap should persist through the summer, as gas-fired generation climbs across the rest of the West. Demand is expected to average the same level in July as in June in the Rocky Mountains, where coal limits gas's gains in power generation. CERA expects prices within the Rockies to gather some support from increasing power loads in the Pacific Northwest, as well as from stronger differentials in the San Juan Basin. On average, Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to average $0.52 per MMBtu during July. In response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the Powder River Basin and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines, Trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend and expand the 500 mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska. Although timing and volumes have yet to be announced, the additional capacity could prevent serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region, which CERA would expect by 2002 without capacity additions. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables.

News Briefs: Reliant Energy Plans to Form Two Public Companies Reliant Energy said it plans to file with the Texas Public Utility Commission a business separation plan under which it would divide into two publicly traded companies to separate its unregulated businesses from its regulated businesses. The company plans an initial public offering of approximately 20% of the common stock of its unregulated operations late this year or early in 2001, assuming market conditions remain favorable. The company expects the IPO to be followed by a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the unregulated company within 12 months. The remaining businesses, which are predominately regulated, will be structured as a holding company. The unregulated company will own Reliant Energy's unregulated power generation and related energy trading and marketing operations, its unregulated retail businesses, which currently include energy, telecommunications and internet services, and the company's European electric generating and trading/marketing operations. The plan also contemplates that in 2004 the unregulated company will receive from the regulated company cash equal to the market value of the regulated company's interest in its Texas regulated generation operations. In addition, the unregulated company will have an option to purchase the regulated company's interest in these operations at a price equal to the market value. The regulated company will include Reliant Energy's electricity and natural gas companies, which serve about four million customers in the U.S. and include Reliant Energy HL&P/Entex, Reliant Energy Arkla, Reliant Energy Entex and Reliant Energy Minnegasco. Other operations in the entity will include its U.S. interstate pipelines, its interests in Latin America and, initially, its Texas regulated generation. 
Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural gas deliverability by the end of this year. NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and transportation-related services, structured power and management services and energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's existing asset valuation. Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with headquarters in Houston. ""By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three years,"" said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year. 
FERC Approves Questar Pipeline The FERC has given final approval for a Questar $155 million pipeline project to transport natural gas to southern California from the Four Corners area at the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. The ruling came after the commission was satisfied the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline project would not harm the environment. The project will consist of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline that was bought by Questar in 1998 from Arco. The pipeline will be converted for natural gas and several new compressors will be built. The pipeline would be divided into a East Zone and a West Zone. The East Zone will begin in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and end at the California border and carry up to 88 MMcf per day. The West Zone is within California and has a capacity of 120 MMcf per 
FPL Acquires Entergy FPL Group will acquire Entergy for about $6.4 billion in stock in a deal that will create the largest US power company. The news sent FPLs shares lower because of disappointment that FPL was not the takeover target. The combined company will have 6.3 million customers and 48,000 MW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electric service to about 3.8 million customers throughout Florida. Entergy delivers electricity to about 2.5 million customers in parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The deal, a $27 billion merger, which included their combined market value of $16.4 billion, $6.9 billion of Entergy debt and $3.8 billion of FPL debt. FPL shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Entergys 43%. The board of directors will be made up of 8 FPL members and 7 Entergy members. To support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back a total of $1 billion in stock, $570 million in FPL stock and $430 million in Entergy stock. FPL shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of FPLs 170.5 million diluted shares outstanding. Entergy shareholders would receive 0.585 share in the new company for each of their 228.1 million diluted shares outstanding. Shares of FPL fell more than 8%, to 48-1/4 and Entergy shares fell more than 10% to 27-1/4 yesterday afternoon. Based on FPLs price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at about $28.33 per share. Many had speculated FPL was to be bought rather than be involved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $200 million break-up fee in case either side terminates the deal. The merger of FPL and Entergy must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal regulators and was expected to close next year. The combined company expects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPLs current dividend policy. Based on its current annual dividend of $2.16 per share, Entergys shareholders would receive $1.26 per share compared with its current dividend of $1.20 per share. FPLs Broadhead will become the chairman and Entergy Chief Executive Leonard will become chief executive of the new company. The expected annual cost savings and increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businesses may range from $150 million to $275 million, with about half the cost savings to come from work force reductions, mainly through attrition, 
Due to a compressor failure at its Riner Station, Williams declared a force majeure situation on Line Segments 490 and 491. Necessary repairs are expected to be completed by next Monday's gas day. Since capacity in the two segments has been reduced, maintenance originally scheduled for the week of Aug. 21 at the Cheyenne and Ogallah Stations will be done this week to minimize 
El Paso declared an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Thursday that will remain in effect until further notice. The pipeline said it will limit scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system integrity. Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance 
Kern River Open Season Kern River is holding an open season through Aug. 18 to determine interest in year-round FT to Nevada and California and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm shippers. The pipeline said it can offer significantly reduced FT rates based on recent FERC approval of Kern River's Extended Term Rate Program (ET Program). Under ET Program, customers could receive a rate reduction from $0.64/Dth to approximately $0.42 under a 15-year contract. Because system expansion can be accomplished by the addition of compression facilities, it could result in an overall lowering of rolled-in rates for all shippers, Kern River said. Depending on open season results, the pipeline is proposing a mainline expansion of up to 500 MMcf/d with an in-service target date of May 1, 2002. If goals can be met using relinquished capacity and no new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as Oct. 1, 2001. Call Laurie Brown at (801) 584-6410 or Greg Snow at -7270 for more information. Panda Links to Transmission Grid for Gila Bend Plant Panda Energy International inked a firm electrical transmission agreement with Arizona Public Service to supply power from its proposed natural gas-fired 2,000 MW plant to be located in the town of Gila Bend. The proposed plant is before the Arizona Corporation Committee for review. Senior vice president of merchant plant development for Panda, Garry Hubbard, said that the firm contract is ""a critical step forward for the plant."" The new plant is on schedule to commence construction later this year, with start up 18 months later, he added.

Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California, and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West. Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over $40.00 per MMBtu during December after averaging over $15.00 per MMBtu through the second half of November. Extreme weather, strong power demand for gas, and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor.

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to markets in New Jersey and New York. Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered by the original certificate. The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The $80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines currently are running full. 
Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge new rival for Western Canadian supply. ""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
CERA Alert: December 13, 2000 Title: California on the Brink CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK The California Stalemate California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible. Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a challenging siting and permitting process. Medicine Worse than the Illness Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of California's electric market woes.* * Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities. * Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. * Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development. * Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development. * Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust. CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state. Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage. The Road to Recovery There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall: * Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? * Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build. * Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence (and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments. * Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response. * Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) future price volatility. * Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its course. * Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions. * Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power. **end** This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours. ********************************************************************** This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

InterGen Takes 30% Stake in Coral Energy With plans to grow its power generation portfolio in the United States, InterGen, the power generation joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings Inc., closed a deal yesterday giving the international developer a 30% equity interest in Houston-based Coral Energy, one of the largest natural gas and power marketers in the country. Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction giant Bechtel would fold InterGen, InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business (see Daily GPI, July 10). Under the agreement announced yesterday, InterGen will receive the majority of the natural gas pipeline, storage and power generation assets of Shell's Coral Energy affiliate in the United States. It remains a joint venture of Shell and Bechtel. The move gives Shell a 68% ownership in InterGen, with Bechtel owning the remaining 32%. InterGen had been formed as a 50/50 joint venture, and Bechtel made an undisclosed payment to Shell in the deal. About 230 Coral employees, mostly related to the Texas-based assets in Houston, will become InterGen employees under the agreement. InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development, with projects around the world. Carlos Riva, InterGen's CEO, said that the transaction ""represents a significant boost to our plans in the United States. These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier U.S. gas and electricity trading enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the U.S.

FERC Restructures California Power Market Responding to a California power market gone haywire and teetering on the brink of operational and financial disaster, FERC Friday issued a series of remedial measures, virtually stripping the Cal-PX and Cal-ISO of their control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate bilateral forward contracts. The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange (Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market. FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec. 19 in Washington of parties in the state's power market to negotiate those contracts. ""California does [not] have the benefit of a competitive market,"" Chairman James Hoecker said, noting he had heard the state's power market called ""crisis by design."" The design was ""an unworkable state law, the product of command and control that described in detail"" exactly how the market should function. ""It wasn't competition,"" Hoecker said. ""It's time to get serious about saving the future of competitive markets...Competition did not fail in principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never 
Title: Into the Stratosphere URL: http://www20.cera.com/client/knowledgearea/report/0,1448,CID1295_KID8_SRTDAT_T YPRPT,00.html High demand, perilously low storage inventories, and a supply response that is only beginning have driven gas prices in North America to stratospheric levels. The physical shortfall is now real enough, and prices have risen well above previous record highs to levels that should drive any demand that can realistically do so to leave the market. Gas is now pricing near the level of distillate for the first time ever, providing strong economic incentives to push to maximum levels of fuel switching. ?

Shippers Condemn Northwest's Must-Flow OFOs Several northern Nevada industrial gas users have accused Northwest Pipeline of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily must-flow operational flow orders (OFOs) that it has issued since early December in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system. In a Section 5 complaint filed Friday, the industrial gas customers called on FERC to direct Northwest to ""cease and desist"" the alleged violation of the tariff, which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of Northwest's system. The effect of the must-flow OFOs is to compel shippers to make up the capacity shortfall on Northwest's system via displacement, the industrials noted. Northwest's firm contractual demand is 720,000 Dth/d, but its physical capacity is only 474,000 Dth/d. Pan-Alberta Gas (U.S.) Inc. provides 144,000 Dth/d through a displacement arrangement, while shippers are left to make up the remaining 102,000 Dth/d. The industrial users contend they shouldn't be penalized for not complying with the must-flow OFOs because Northwest's tariff exempts shippers that have made ""good faith efforts"" to obtain gas supply, but have been unsuccessful. At issue is whether the ""good faith efforts"" applies to purchasing gas at reasonable costs, which is how the industrials interpret the tariff, or

PG&E to Expand Pacific Northwest System Responding to tight energy supplies in the Pacific Northwest and California, PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group revealed plans Wednesday to begin an open season early next year, kicking off a five-year expansion effort. The first phase would add 200 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity out of western Canada on its Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) pipeline system. The PG&E GTN group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by November 2002 at the latest. ""As we have been anticipating, the western natural gas market is at a critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity,"" said Thomas B. King, president of the PG&E National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) West Region. ""Gas supplies into the Pacific Northwest and California are very tight. At the same time, the market is strong and growing, and the PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum capacity levels for the greater part of the year. We believe GTN is now positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional supplies of natural gas --- at competitive transportation rates --- in this 
El Paso Proceeding with NM Pipe Integrity Testing El Paso Natural Gas has received approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) to conduct more internal inspections on its rebuilt New Mexico pipeline, which ruptured August 19 killing 11 people (see Daily GPI, Aug. 22). Since the explosion, flows through the line, which runs from West Texas to California, have been reduced to 85% capacity, or about 920 MMcf/d. OPS said the El Paso line has already been repaired and put through hydrostatic testing, which it passed. Hydrostatic testing checks for cracks by forcing high-pressure water through the line. Now El Paso has the green light to begin smart pig testing, which will examine the internal integrity of the line. The device, called a pig because of the sound it makes during inspections, has sensors and once placed inside the line, it can detect dents, deformities and changes in wall thickness. Neither OPS nor El Paso released a timetable as to when the pigging would occur or how long it would take. However, once the testing is completed, the results will be evaluated by OPS, which then would determine if the line were safe for commercial use. OPS has not issued actual regulations on smart pig use, but they have become increasingly sophisticated and more widely used. Even though hydrostatic testing can actually detect certain flaws that are invisible to smart pigs, the pigging process is considered a complement to the water testing and ensures more integrity in test results. OPS requires all pipe to undergo at least one hydrostatic test after construction. Although not mandated, OPS also has proposed requiring pipelines that transport liquid petroleum products to use direct assessment methods such as pigging to evaluate the pipeline's integrity. Other types of inspections include using magnetic particles or ultrasound to measure the pipe wall's thickness. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Note:  Did this request really happen this way?  Why would the FERC ask one pipeline to expand and not all of them feeding the state.  What have you all heard? FERC Asks El Paso to Expand A key FERC staffer this week asked El Paso Natural Gas to consider switching its Line 2000 crude-oil conversion from a replacement project to an expansion of its existing system to ease pipeline capacity constraints to the California border. ""I am writing to inquire about the feasibility of modifying the...project in a manner which could assist the difficult situation now confronting the California gas market,"" said Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects. In August, El Paso filed an application to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso seeks to convert the 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion. ""It appears that if El Paso kept the six...compressor stations on the line and implemented any necessary facility additions and modifications to integrate the converted line with its existing South System, it may be 
DEFS Finishes 2000 With Multiple Transactions Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) finished off 2000 with a bang by completing three year-end asset transactions. First, the company finalized the $91 million sale of natural gas liquid (NGL) pipeline assets to TEPPCO Crude Pipeline, L.P., then it completed the purchase of certain natural gas pipeline assets from El Paso Field Services in two separate deals for an undisclosed sum. The assets sold to TEPPCO include the Panola Pipeline and the San Jacinto Pipeline, both of which are NGL pipelines. Under the agreement, TEPPCO also agreed to take over the lease of a 34-mile condensate pipeline. The three pipelines included in the sale all originate at DEFS' East Texas Plant Complex located in Panola County, TX. ""This sale underscores our strategy of growing earnings through our TEPPCO master limited partnership,"" said Jim Mogg, CEO of DEFS. ""In 2000, we almost doubled the distribution that DEFS received as the general partner of TEPPCO Partners, L.P., and at the same time increased the distribution to limited 
Nymex Moves Gas Opening Bell Up to 9:30 a.m. The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange has amended plans to move up the start-up time for natural gas futures trading because of the overlap with crude oil markets, which share an options ring with natural gas. Daily gas futures trading now will commence at 9:30 a.m. rather than 9:45. The board has scheduled expanded energy trading hours to begin with the Sept. 8 trading session. On July 13, the board voted to expand futures trading hours electronically for its light sweet crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas futures and options markets. It also voted to have an earlier opening for the open outcry session for natural gas futures and options. Beginning at 4 p.m. on Sept. 7 the Nymex Access electronic trading sessions for those commodities will be extended to run from 4 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, to 9 a.m. the following day.

Breaking News : California Stakeholders Agree to Key Objectives posted 10:18 AM (CST) Jan 10, 2001 Signs of compromise and cooperation emerged from a marathon seven-hour meeting last night between California government officials, power industry executives and the Clinton administration on California's continuing energy crisis. A set of key principles were hammered out by the two dozen participants, according to a statement issued following the meeting. The stakeholders agreed on the need for cooperation to ""maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy of California utilities and assure the long-term regularity of market conditions."" The utilities have amassed $12 billion in unrecovered wholesale power costs, and despite the recent approval of new rate surcharges the utilities remain on the brink of financial insolvency. The meeting participants agreed on a few crucial elements of a solution to California's power woes, including the following: development of approaches to promote long-term purchases of power, possibly by the state, from generators at an ""attractive fixed rate;"" the willingness of generators and qualifying facilities and marketers to provide on a short-term basis ""forebearance of amounts owed by Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison"" in the context of a comprehensive solution; the need to find ""satisfactory approaches"" to the utilities' obligations to purchase power; cooperation to ""better match supply and demand;"" and review of the existing qualifying facilities payment structures. Working groups are meeting today in Washington, D.C. to address additional technical details and the senior policy makers will reconvene this weekend to complete an agreement. FERC Chairman James Hoecker, said it was ""to early to declare victory,"" but it was ""an important first step to try to find ways to maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy."" Hoecker, who also announced today that he will be leaving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Jan. 18, said the atmosphere at the meeting was highly cooperative. ""They appear to be headed in the direction that would seem to be consistent with FERC's Dec. 15 order,"" he said. 
Note:  The EIA says that gas storage levels at the end of December were 10% lower than the previous record low set in 1976. They have revised their price forecast for 2001 to $5.20 (with the heating season at $6.23) and estimate that 2000 will come in at $3.70. EIA Raises Price Forecasts, Confirms Dire Storage Situation The Energy Information Administration (EIA) again raised its wholesale and retail gas price projections for the winter and confirmed that gas storage levels at the end of December were lower by 10% than the previous record low set in 1976. Strong demand during November and December, which the National Weather Service has said were the coldest on record, reduced gas stocks to record lows for the period, and continued cold should keep storage low and prices very high for the remainder of the heating season, EIA said yesterday in its Short Term Energy Outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2000, gas-weighted heating degree-days were estimated to have been up by 28% over last year's relatively mild fourth quarter. Gas demand increased 10% over the year prior. Over the entire six months of winter (Oct. 1, 2000 to March 31, 2001), EIA projects demand will rise by 7% compared to the prior winter, with residential and commercial sector demand up by 17% over last winter. EIA now expects wellhead prices to average $5.20/Mcf in 2001 compared to an estimated $3.70 in 2000 (72% higher than in 1999) and about $4.50 projected for 2002. It also raised its projections on retail prices to 70% above winter 1999-2000 levels. The expected 45% increase in the nominal average residential price would be 
Title: A Colossal and Dangerous Failure URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2185 Overview: WESTERN ENERGY=01*CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR STAYS THE COURSE California governor Gray Davis provided his strongest public statements to= =20 date regarding the state=01,s power crisis in his annual State of the State= =20 Address on January 8, 2001. Echoing many of his previous positions on what = he=20 perceives as a flawed and unfair California market structure, the governor= =20 labeled the state=01,s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous= =20 failure. Among other actions, he launched new initiatives valued at $1=20 billion to encourage conservation, provide financing and land to new=20 generators, grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of=20 transactions to manage electricity costs, and increase regulatory scrutiny = of=20 existing market suppliers. The governor also called for a greater role for= =20 the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants. The governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the=20 steps necessary to put California on the road to recovery. Details regardin= g=20 sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming. Although he=20 stated that California=01,s investor-owned utilities must not be allowed to= go=20 bankrupt, no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given. The financi= al=20 community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provid= e=20 financial backing for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California=20 Edison. At this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to= =20 guarantee their solvency. The governor again criticized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for= =20 what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the= =20 wholesale market. Merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the=20 state, and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their= =20 operations, jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid. New, more sever= e=20 sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting wh= at=20 investigators find as unreasonable profits. A Los Angeles Times poll released the morning before the governor=01,s addr= ess=20 indicated that the majority of Californians still do not believe there is a= n=20 energy crisis. Although the 33 percent growth in the state=01,s economy ove= r the=20 past ten years has nearly outstripped the state=01,s and surrounding region= =01,s=20 supplies of power, the bulk of the governor=01,s statements continue to foc= us on=20 the culpability of power producers, rather than the serious supply shortfal= l.

El Paso Merchant Ordered to Relinquish Data FERC yesterday ordered El Paso Merchant Energy to stop stonewalling and turn over protected materials to parties involved in a complaint case in which it's alleged the affiliate received preferential treatment when it acquired 1.2 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. Specifically, the Commission denied El Paso Merchant's request for rehearing of a June 2000 order that granted in part the discovery sought by the California Public Utilities Commission, and rejected rehearing of a September protective order. The latter directed El Paso Merchant to make available to all intervening parties, who agreed to the terms of the protective order, all of the materials that were being submitted to the CPUC and FERC in the case. So far, El Paso Merchant has refused to release the information to these parties, claiming the materials being filed with the CPUC and FERC are for ""Government Eyes Only."" It also argues that the protective order offers inadequate protection of commercially sensitive information. The Commission disagreed. ""El Paso Merchant has not substantiated or sufficiently justified its broad claim that all of the 'protected materials' provided to CPUC and this Commission warrant the designation 'Government Eyes Only.' Indeed, all of the information that El Paso Merchant seeks to shield...relates directly to the issues,"" the order said [RP00-241]. Also, FERC finds that the protective order provides ""sufficient protection for El

American Electric Power Buys Houston Pipe Line American Electric Power Thursday announced it has made a major move to expand its wholesale natural gas business in the Southwest, agreeing to acquire the 2.4 Bcf/d Houston Pipe Line (HPL) along with the Bammel storage field, one of the largest storage fields in North America, from Enron. AEP said since some details remain to be worked out, it was not disclosing the terms of the transaction at this time. AEP will be acquiring the stock of HPL and it expects to complete the deal in the next couple months. HPL, one of the two original pipelines joined by Enron Chairman Ken Lay to form the company in the mid-1980s, has an extensive 4,400 mile transportation and gathering system through southern Texas. The 118 Bcf Bammel field, located near the Houston Ship Channel market area, has a 65.7 Bcf working gas capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities. It has a 1.4 Bcf/d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 MMcf/d injection capacity. ""Adding HPL to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of becoming a top-10 gas trader and marketer,"" said Paul Addis, executive vice president for AEP. The company currently is second in the U.S. in electricity volume. ""HPL will enhance AEP's natural gas business with its multiple connections into the production areas of Texas, its numerous interconnects with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around 
CA Power Market Awaits Bailout California power watchers were hoping for results early this week from the marathon government-industry negotiations. The principals of last Tuesday night's marathon session were expected to meet by video-conference over the weekend to review solutions developed by staff working groups, which met through the end of the week. (see Daily GPI, Jan. 11) On the West Coast the week ended with emergency legislation starting its dash through the state capital, and the governor holding a 90-minute meeting with two neighboring western governors to piece together a regional strategy on joint energy conversation/supply cooperation. On Friday Gov. Gray Davis said if FERC fails to act, he is sure Congress will take up legislation to stabilize power prices throughout the country, ""or at least give governors the option to opt into a stabilized pricing mechanism. Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-CA, announced she was working on a bill to be offered later this month, which would allow the energy secretary to impose price caps. Davis indicated that he and federal officials would be working over the weekend and he expects to have something to announce early next week, and in the long term he expects to ""solve this problem in the next 90 days and in 
CMS, DEFS Swap Strategic Properties In a strategic move said to benefit both midstream energy companies, CMS Field Services Inc. has swapped some of its natural gas assets in Oklahoma and Kansas for some of Duke Energy Field Services' similar assets onshore and offshore Louisiana. DEFS' natural gas gathering and condensate measuring and transportation assets onshore and offshore Louisiana were exchanged with CMS Field Services' assets in Oklahoma and Kansas, giving each company more proximity to their other assets. The deal closed Dec. 20 and was announced Friday. No financial details were disclosed. 
Briefing 
A hydrostatic test of Line 3201 identified some pipe that must be replaced, El Paso said Thursday, and once that is done the test must be performed again. It estimated the project will extend through Sunday, reducing Bondad Mainline capacity by 180 MMcf/d (normal capacity is 675 MMcf/d) and affecting seven receipt points. With Line 3201 out of service, the 180 MMcf/d loss can not be made up at points downstream of Bondad Mainline, El Paso said. Thus the same (not additional) 180 MMcf/d reduction must be applied at Gallup (NM) Station. PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest said its Internet-based nomination system became operational again Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening power failure caused the server to crash. El Paso will hold meetings Aug. 9 in Houston, Aug. 10 in Los Angeles and Aug. 11 in Phoenix to present details of its Line No. 2000 Project. The project requires FERC approval to abandon certain mainline compressor facilities and replace them with a 30-inch crude oil pipeline upon its conversion to natural gas service. El Paso announced early this year (see Daily GPI, Feb. 4) it was buying part of the All American Pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. and would invest $75 million to convert the segment to a natural gas pipeline. The segment being converted extends 1,088 miles from Emidio, CA, to McCamey, TX. Those planning to attend one of next week's meetings should call Lisa Holmes at 
Breaking News: CA Governor Declares State of Emergency posted 2:37 AM (CST) Jan 18, 2001 Late Wednesday following a day of rolling blackouts and the prospect for more with electricity supplies drying up throughout the West, California Gov. Gray Davis declared a state of emergency due to the power shortage and directed the state water resources department to begin securing power supplies for the beleaguered state grid. In making the bold move, Gov. Davis also announced that his conservation plan for state facilities and operations already has reached its goal of reducing energy use by more than 5%. In the emergency proclamation, the governor said that electricity presently available through California three major investor-owned utilities is ""insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruptions of electric service,"" and thus, he was ordering all state agencies to use their resources to do whatever they can to alleviate the power shortage. Then he went on to specifically empower the water resources agency, which has been a key player in helping the state's transmission grid operator (Cal-ISO) narrowly avoid blackouts or avoid them being felt more pervasively throughout the state. Noting that peak electrical loads for state buildings and institutions are on target for a 200 MW reduction and the water resources department peak pumping load has been reduced by 450 MW, Gov. Davis lauded Californians for having ""stepped up to the plate and dramatically reduced their appetite for electricity,"" noting that the state already is 47th in the nation among the lowest per-capita energy use and the state's electricity prices are the 10th 
El Paso Says It's Open to Expansion of System El Paso Natural Gas ""is willing to expand its system"" to the California border if ""sufficient support"" for such a project can be demonstrated through long-term capacity contracts, the pipeline told FERC. The pipeline's comments were in response to a Commission inquiry asking El Paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed Line 2000 crude-oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline capacity crunch in the West.  Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, raised the prospect in a Jan. 3 letter to El Paso, saying that modifying the project ""could assist the difficult situation"" now facing the California gas market. Specifically, the Commission has recommended that El Paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion. 
Enron Q4 profit rises 32 percent Strong business mix pushes energy firm past estimates MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 2001 11:19:00 AM EST By Andrew Kelly HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas, on Monday reported a sharp rise in fourth-quarter operating earnings, surpassing expectations, as online trading drove strong growth at its core wholesale energy operations. Enron said it took a net non-recurring after-tax charge of $287 million in the fourth quarter related to its troubled water affiliate Azurix Corp. AZX </quotes/quotes.asp?symb=AZX&source=>. Enron announced plans last year to finance a buyout that would take Azurix private. Earnings before non-recurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 million, or 41 cents a share, from $259 million or 31 cents a share a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 35 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. In early Monday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron's shares were up $3-1/8, or 4.41 percent, at $74. Fourth-quarter net income including the Azurix charge was $60 million, or 5 cents per share. The company's fourth-quarter revenues rose 271 percent from a year earlier, to $40.8 billion. ""The impressive thing is the overall growth that they experienced,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. ""I think it had been in most people's

Bush Administration Extends Emergency Supply Orders Despite recent indications that the Bush administration would take a more hands-off approach to the California crisis, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham late yesterday gave PG&E and Southern California Edison another two weeks of breathing room by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power suppliers to continue supplying the cash-strapped utilities. The emergency gas order now expires at 3 a.m. (EST) Feb. 7. In granting the extensions, Abraham urged the state to get to work to solve its own problems. He said only California can implement the policies necessary to resolve the short-term and long-term supply challenges. ""Our action today is designed to give the governor, the California legislature and other relevant parties the time to take necessary action. I strongly urge the parties to act immediately,"" said Abraham. He also said he was keenly aware that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas. Despite the action, PG&E said it still is having trouble getting gas suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued Jan. 19. ""The gas supply situation is [not good],"" utility spokeswoman Staci Homrig said yesterday afternoon. ""We are quickly depleting our storage. Even under the order, J. Aron & Co. [a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs] has not delivered gas. They represent about 9% of our daily needs (1.5 Bcf/d in January). ""Oh yeah, we've been in contact with them,"" she said. ""We've been in contact with the DOE, too. The other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to us last week have made gas available to us under the order. They are Sempra Energy Trading and Western Gas Resources."" Homrig said PG&E expected DOE to take legal action against those who didn't resume deliveries. The order applied to 27 gas suppliers, all of which supplied gas to PG&E within the last 30 days. ""There's not a lot I can say,"" said J. Aron spokeswoman Kate Baum. ""J. Aron has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order.

CA Reviews State Power Auction Results California's closely watched entry into the long-term, bulk power market turned up 39 bidders at an average 6.9 cents/kWh price, the governor's office reported late Wednesday, as the state government finished its whirlwind 27-hour, sealed-bid power auction. Gov. Gray Davis said the state received a ""very representative bid with a good deal of power bid for, and it was a very good sample, certainly one that 
Breaking News: Cal-PX Shuts Down Trading posted 2:47 PM (CST) Jan 30, 2001 In direct reaction to federal regulatory moves Monday, the California Power Exchange (Cal-PX) board decided to shut down day-ahead and day-of wholesale electricity markets by noon Wednesday, Jan. 31. Today will be the last day of trading for the day-ahead, and Wednesday the final day for the day-of, bringing to a close one part of the state's initial 1996 electric industry restructuring law that created the state-chartered, nonprofit public benefits corporation to provide a wholesale spot market through which California's three major investor-owned utilities were required to buy and sell all of their wholesale power. They are no longer required to do so. ""Regrettably, Cal-PX must take this extraordinary action in response to Monday's FERC order that directs us to immediately comply with the terms of its Dec. 15 order and implement a $150/MWh breakpoint,"" said Cal-PX CEO George Sladoje, who noted that there is a Feb. 7 oral argument set for the power exchanges emergency motion and petition with the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, requesting a stay and rehearing of the original FERC Dec. 15 order. The Cal-PX will not close down entirely as yet. It will continue to perform all scheduling and settlement services for its current participants. ""Forward contracts will be scheduled via approved alternative delivery mechanisms, assuring both buyers and sellers will not be inconvenienced or exposed to adverse economic impact as a result of the suspension of the day-ahead

New Hurricane Forecast out of CSU Renowned hurricane soothsayer Dr. William Gray and his team at Colorado State University have scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the season to be more active than average. Seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three of them are expected to be intense rather than the four expected in the group's prior forecast on June 7. In round numbers, the August forecast is for three named storms, two hurricanes, and one intense or major hurricane. ""Information obtained through July 2000 indicates that the Atlantic hurricane season in 2000 is likely to be less active than the four recent very busy years of 1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999. However, total activity is expected to exceed the long term average and is anticipated to be considerably more active than the mean for the recent period of 1970 through 1994. ""We estimate that the 2000 season will have seven hurricanes (average is 5.7), 11 named storms (average is 9.3), 55 named storm days (average is 47), 30 hurricane days (average is 24), three intense (category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.2), six intense hurricane days (average is 4.7) and a Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) of 90 (average is 71). Collectively, net tropical cyclone activity in year 2000 is expected to be about 130% of the long term average. The early August forecast update is in close to Gray's Dec. 8, 1999) and April 7 forecasts, but somewhat lower than his recent June 7 update. ""The forecast has been lowered slightly [because] June-July global circulation conditions have not progressed quite as favorably for hurricane

CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing A special session yesterday of California's regulators gave PG&E's utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past Feb. 7 when the current federal DOE emergency order expires, but it postponed action on another PG&E request that Southern California Gas Co. --- which has strongly objected --- be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the PG&E utility's residential and small business customers. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said PG&E's utility is a ""victim --- a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers,"" now demanding payment for future supplies up front --- not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its credit-worthiness. The CPUC action allows PG&E's utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with PG&E's gas utility operations while the credit-worthiness of the company itself is dubious. It won't be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation, according to PG&E gas utility spokesperson Staci Homrig. On the operational side, PG&E on Wednesday declared a low-inventory OFO because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system. The action was thought to help cause the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point, Homrig said. Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. ""These gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh,"" Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. ""Suppliers who have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these

Note:  Official results not yet released.   Kern River currently has a project on file for an expansion to be placed in service on 5-1-02 for 124,500 Dth/day at a cost of $80MM. Second Kern River Open Season Successful Williams' Kern River Gas Transmission last week completed an open season for added firm capacity on its pipeline into Nevada and/or California amid rave reviews, although specific details were not yet released by the Salt Lake City-based interstate pipeline. ""The results were outstanding,"" said a Williams spokesperson in Salt Lake City. ""I mean they were huge, but we don't have that many details yet."" The pipeline indicated it should have more information this week. New service resulting from this open season would be available May 1, 2003 for terms of 10 or 15 years, the company said at the time of starting the two-month open season. The capacity dates are geared to coincide with the proposed opening of several new electric generating plants in Nevada and California, and since that date the call for added generation throughout the western states has been reiterated as it was at last Friday's Western Governors' Association energy roundtable in Portland, OR. Although Kern River has ruled out proposing new laterals, it has indicated it planned to help meet the increased gas demand for new power plants by adding compression and looping. The company has intends to finalize expansion design and rate impact analyses following the close of this most recent open season. Another open season last fall was held on an added 124,500 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity into California along Kern's 922-mile interstate pipeline from Wyoming (see Daily GPI, Nov. 16, 2000 <d20001116g.html>). 
Filings: The Ball is in FERC's Court 
Note:  There are a lot of good names and organizations in this article, especially the Economic Development Councils.  Worth spending some time with them? Lorna Wednesday, February 7, 2001 Nevada Goes for the Gold By Dave Todd dtodd@ftenergy.com <mailto:dtodd@ftenergy.com> It's a reverse twist on America's economic history. One might even call it a case of Eastward Ho! For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part of the United States, entrepreneurs are talking about leaving, not moving into, the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east. Not much farther east, only over the mountains into neighboring states, but still in that direction, as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of California. And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from Nevada. Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes ""could be the genesis for industry departures from the state."" The impact on large industrial users, he warned, could ""provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn"" in California, which accounts for about 12% of the United States GDP. California's mass exodus Since the beginning of the year, Nevada's primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state. The bad news for California is that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or ""wannabes"" whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery. Somer Hollingsworth, president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in Las Vegas, said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to Nevada. In meeting with the company he asked, ""Are there others like you? And

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Tue, August 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing: In a High Range Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1314 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/081500_17/nag_alt_081500_17_ab.html ********************************************************************** Gas prices remain within a high range, with prices volatile between approximately $3.75 and $4.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). Prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall, until the uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself. At the lower end of this range--and with oil prices in the upper $20s per barrel or higher--price support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to reactivate industrial demand. Gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions, allowing storage injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter. Above-normal heat in only one or two regions, however, or even the threat of storms in the Gulf of Mexico will pull prices quickly upward. As for the upper boundary, although prices in specific regions such as California and the Northeast may reach above $5.00, an actual storm in the Gulf or more widespread heat than! has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the Henry Hub much above $4.50. Absent tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico, CERA expects prices to settle into the lower portion of this band during September (see Table 1). Although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely to sustain prices through much of August, the seasonal decline in generation demand into September should allow storage injections to increase by 1.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. As a result, CERA expects prices to settle somewhat, averaging $3.95 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub during September. However, the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged: supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter. Any interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward; next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year. Gas Storage--Not Yet Enough Mild weather over much of the United States during July allowed a much-needed recovery in storage injections, with the estimated injection rate increasing by nearly 2.5 Bcf per day from year-earlier levels (see Table 2). This rate was enabled entirely by lower demand, however, and not added supply. The result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during August, the US storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near 350 Bcf. Although the deficit is likely to decline on average during August, it is even more likely to expand again during September, especially should any storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms. Absolute inventories and supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market. Inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from occurring next spring. Should injections continue as expected, inventories would reach approximately 2,750 Bcf by October 31; but reaching even this level, still an all-time low annual maximum inventory, requires some help from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in October. Storage inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season. Regional Markets--Western Disconnects Continue Wide differentials emerged this summer in the West and look likely to persist through September. In Southern California record summer demand levels have pushed pipeline flows to new highs. Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America. In the Rockies supply growth has pushed up pipeline flows out of the region. Power loads should ease somewhat in Southern California, and that easing will bring some decline in the Topock premium. Pressure on Rocky Mountains and San Juan prices should persist until the start of the heating season in late October (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: *  Rockies. Pipeline capacity out of the Rockies is running nearly full to every export market except the San Juan Basin. Emerging pipeline bottlenecks should keep differentials wide during September, with an average differential of $0.75 per MMBtu. *  San Juan. In the San Juan increased imports from the Rocky Mountains and high utilization rates on capacity into California are pressuring prices. CERA expects differentials to average $0.55 per MMBtu for the month of September. San Juan differentials will narrow more substantially when Rocky Mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand during the fourth quarter. *  Permian and Mid-Continent. Strong power loads in Texas have supported Permian Basin prices during July and August. Persistent power demand is expected to keep differentials around $0.08 per MMBtu for September. Mid-Continent prices should average just under Permian prices. *  Chicago. Steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at Chicago in the face of declining power generation into September. July premiums of $0.06 to $0.07 have already come down in early August and are likely to remain low, at approximately $0.03 for September. *  Northeast markets. Northeast price premiums have averaged from the mid-$0.20s to the mid-$0.30s, depending on generation load and proximity to the New York Facilities Group major meters. CERA expects little to change this relationship, but as generation loads decline into September, premiums could move closer to the fuel cost floor, the mid- to high $0.20s. Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Disappointing Although June displayed year-over-year growth in production in western Canada, July reverted to a decline, and August is running close to last year's level. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in 2000, approximately 9,200 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is expected to produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western Canadian supply build is expected to be flat with 1999, increasing to a positive growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are down 275 MMcf per day on average for 2000 but have been down by over 350 MMcf per day so far in the third quarter. PG&E GT-NW volumes were up by over 300 MMcf per day in June and July but have dropped to year-earlier levels in August and are expected to remain close to last year's levels for September. Northern Border Pipeline is operating at rates similar to last year's on average in 2000 but is expected to decrease about 50 MMcf per day for the third quarter. Western Canadian demand is currently up slightly, driven by the warmer-than-normal weather in late July and early August, but should be closer to 1999 levels in September. High Prices: Wide Differentials The AECO-Henry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few months from the low US$0.30s of the first quarter to US$0.84 in July. The differential increased to well over a dollar in the second week of August, but the driver for that increase was maintenance that reduced the export capacity at Empress. August and September are expected to average in the mid-$0.80s. AECO is expected to average C$4.67 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.35 per MMBtu) for August, with September softening to C$4.53 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu) for a third quarter average of C$4.54 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables. ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Note the discussion on market share halfway through the article. Top Gas Gorillas Show Strong Volume Growth The year 2000 was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing, with huge increases in gas prices, enormous volatility, continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits. Physical gas sales volumes for the top 20 marketers in NGI's ranking grew 17% to nearly 150 Bcf/d, and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as Williams reporting 2,000% profit increases in their energy merchant segments. However, for many of the smaller players it was a tough year. ""The big news 
NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : October 29, 2001 ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
Kenosha Exp, Gulf South's Gulf Pines, CIG's Western Frontier 
Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001 Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power producers-may have been lulled to sleep. Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a hold on their fuel costs. However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are raring to get what they believe they deserve. One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com. 
Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/ NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week. For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience.

Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term. FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would ""no longer make available to the public"" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to ""respond timely to legitimate requests"" for such documents. The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
Monthly Briefing 
Note:  The following 3 articles deal with 3 different issues: 1st -- Marketing related 2nd - Operations/marketing related 3rd - Legislative/regulatory related El Paso Explosion Takes 500 MMcf/d Off Market About 1 Bcf/d of flow on El Paso's South Mainline downstream of Pecos River (NM) Station ceased after the pipeline exploded early Saturday, killing 10 people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite. El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers, maximum storage withdrawals, an OFO and other customer cooperation. The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points rose by about 35 cents to lead an overall price surge. However, utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems. SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems. A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power also saw no reason for panic. From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines, he expected that the approximately 80-feet-long section missing from El Paso's line could be ""slapped back into place rather

Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. ""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
Second CA Merchant Storage Field Pushes Back Opening California's second merchant underground natural gas storage project near Sacramento began injecting supplies this month, but its commercial start-up date has been pushed back to Dec. 1, according to the California operations manager for Houston-based Western Hub Properties LLC, the developer. Although it is not fully subscribed more than half the capacity is under contract, according to Jim Fossum, the in-state manager for Western Hub, which was purchased last summer by a partnership of Aquila Inc and ArcLight Energy Partners Fund in a $220 million deal that is still several months away from approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. The Lodi Storage Project near the town of Lodi, CA, about 35 miles south of the state capital, will have ""high-performance, quick-cycle-capabilities"" in a project that stores 12 Bcf of natural gas with a 500 MMcf/d withdrawal rate and 400 MMcf/d injection rate. Fossum said Western Hub also is pursuing a second merchant storage project in the southern half of the state around Bakersfield in the Wheeler Ridge area close to the nexus of all the major interstate natural gas pipeline coming into California. That project, he said, is not included in the Aquila partnership purchase at this time, and will be developed initial by a still-to-be-named company using some of the same personnel that developed Lodi. 
Note:   Update on ammonia plant operations.  Check out the economics in the last paragrph.  LB Ammonia Industry Finally Approaches Full Production Plummeting gas prices have prompted a large number of idled ammonia producers to restart operations this month, after lengthy downtime due to last winter's record gas price increases. Houston-based Industrialinfo.com, which tracks manufacturing, said most of the Gulf Coast and Midcontinent plants are at partial or full capacity.

Initial ALJ Decision in Transwestern Case Delayed FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. has extended by two weeks the deadline for an initial decision in the case in which Transwestern Pipeline is alleged to have arranged more lucrative negotiated-rate deals last winter prior to posting available firm transportation capacity to its web site -- a move that extracted higher rates and limited the capacity availability for recourse-rate shippers for service to California. Due to ""scheduling conflicts,"" Wagner pushed back the deadline for president ALJ Jacob Leventhal to issue a decision to Oct. 30 from Oct. 15. 
Williams Launches uE Web Site For Cross Commodity Pricing Tulsa-based Williams on Monday launched uE, a cross-commodity price index for both spot and future energy prices, as a companion to its web-based EnergyNewsLive.com.

The site includes information on pricing trends including a national spot uE, forward uE, regional uE, commodity quotes, as well as daily, weekly and monthly commentary. Included on the site is EnergyPulse, which will feature Dr. Dennis O'Brien, director of energy and policy at the University of Oklahoma. EnergyPulse now airs every Friday on Williams' EnergyNewsLive site, and offers an analysis of trends in energy pricing and the impact the economy has on energy. 
Note:  This text was released today by Natural Gas Intelligence after an interview with Alliance personnel Construction Completed on Alliance Pipeline The C$4.6 billion Alliance natural gas and liquids pipeline, designed to transport 1.325 Bcf/d from northeast British Columbia to Chicago, has completed its construction phase and now is commissioning the main line, laterals, compressors and supervisory equipment. The final weld was completed last week near Regina, SK, and Alliance now is injecting linepack. The 1,857 mile mainline is stretched to the Chicago area from northeastern BC. October is still the target month to begin service of the pipeline, which will carry both natural gas and liquids. The pipeline system will transport natural gas through a 36-inch diameter high-pressure line. There will be 14 mainline compressor stations: seven in Canada and seven in the U.S. When it began construction in 1999, Alliance already had commitments from 37 shippers for 15-year contracts worth a total of $8.2 billion. The large volumes of gas Alliance will haul from western Canada into the U.S. Midwest is expected to have a major impact on existing pipelines, markets and prices. TransCanada PipeLines already has filed for new tolls to compensate for customers which have failed to renew firm contracts on its line and instead are routing their gas through Alliance. New gas that makes its way into the Chicago area could be sent on to southern Ontario through the Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline, scheduled to open in late October with intial capacity of 720 Bcf/d.  The Foothills/Northern Border route from western Canada into the Midwest also is expected to see some slack. Alliance spokesman Jay Godfrey said last month that ""when October comes we won't be in the position that we'll have to start filling the pipe. It essentially already is going to be full."" Connections to 37 gas plants are already complete. Investors in Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnerships include affiliates of Coastal (14.4%), Enbridge (21.4%), Fort Chicago Energy Partners LP (26%), Williams (14.6%) and Westcoast Energy (23.6%). 
Note:  Kinder says that NGPL expected to add 3000-4000 MW of new gas-fired generation to NGPL each year through 2004. TXU, Kinder Morgan to Build Gas Pipes for FPL Power Plant TXU and Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) subsidiaries have been selected by FPL Energy LLC to fuel its gas-fired power plant near Forney, TX that is scheduled for commercial operation in mid-2003. Both TXU and Kinder Morgan subsidiaries will construct lines that connect to existing facilities. A KMI subsidiary also obtained a long-term contract with FPL to transport gas to a new facility. Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline LLC, a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, will construct a 30-inch, 85-mile pipe from an interconnect in Lamar County, TX to FPL Energy's existing 1,000 MW plant in Paris, TX and its 1,789 MW plant in Forney now under construction. The new pipeline will cost about $70 million and will have a capacity of 325,000 MMBtu/d. The company plans to finalize the new pipeline's route to minimize environmental and public impact and ""wherever possible"" to follow existing linear facilities such as power lines, highways and railroads. Construction is set to begin next summer. Richard Kinder, CEO of KMI, said that when the pipe is completed in the spring of 2003, it will be immediately accretive to KMI's earnings and cash flow, and called it ""another example of our strategy of investing in pipeline infrastructure to enter new markets"" where natural gas use is growing. TXU Lone Star Pipeline, a subsidiary of TXU, will construct a two-mile-long, 24-inch pipeline from its existing gas transmission system in eastern Dallas County to the Forney plant. TXU will replace a smaller, existing pipe in an existing pipeline right-of-way. Construction will begin next spring. No financial details on the TXU pipe were disclosed. Along with gaining the pipe contract, KMI subsidiary Natural Gas Pipeline Co.(NGPL) signed a firm transportation contract to provide FPL with natural gas to power its 1,789 MW facility in Forney. Under the long-term agreement, FPL Energy has subscribed for 250,000 MMBtu/d of firm capacity on the NGPL system, effective with the startup of operations at the new plant. FPL also agreed to extend an existing contract for 50,000 MMBtu/d of firm transportation service for another 18 years. ""We expect to add 3,000-4,000 new megawatts of gas-fired electric generation to NGPL each year through 2004,"" said CEO Kinder. FPL owns and operates power plants with more than 4,400 total net MW in 12 states around the country. New projects will add nearly 6,000 MW of capacity to its portfolio by the end of 2003.

Wood Signals That El Paso's FR Contracts Are High on Agenda FERC denied rehearing of a June order that permits Arizona Public Service Co. to assign its full-requirements (FR) capacity contract on El Paso Natural Gas to affiliate Pinnacle West Energy to serve a new gas-fired generation facility that it is building in Arizona. On the surface, it seemed a clear victory for the companies involved. However, Chairman Pat Wood made it very clear that he has concerns about FR service on El Paso, which entitles customers to unlimited capacity at frozen rates, and that he plans to take up the issue at a later date. ""I will reluctantly go along with the order denying rehearing, but [I] look forward very aggressively to a forum in which we can address the capacity concerns"" on El Paso, Wood said Wednesday during a marathon Commission meeting, the first over which he presided [CP01-90, RP00-336]. The proper forum for discussion of the FR service will be El Paso's Order 637 proceeding, he noted. 
Note:  Most people have probably seen the announcement on the sale of TransCanada Gas Marketing (Cibola and other operations) to BP unit.  There are a few additional details in this announcement.  LB TransCanada Sells Gas Marketing, Trading To BP Following through on a cost-cutting initiative begun in 1999 under another CEO, Calgary-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. on Friday said it has reached an agreement to sell some of its natural gas marketing and trading operations to BP Gas & Power. Included in the sale is CanStates Gas Marketing, a contract to manage gas supply assets for SEMCO Energy Gas Co., and the marketing and trading operations in its Omaha, NE office. Financial details were not disclosed. The sale, expected to close in the fourth quarter, is part of a long process first begun in 1999 by then-CEO Doug Baldwin, who told investors to expect C$3 billion of the company's C$26 billion in assets to be put on the auction block by the end of 2001.  Earlier this year, TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas transporter, said it would exit the natural gas marketing business to focus on its core natural gas transmission and power businesses in Canada and the northern tier of the United States. 
Note:  This summary of the Canadian Gas Potential Committee Report outlines the basic downside analysis of the reserves that exist in the Alaskan Frontier as well as the coalbed methane gas.  There will much discussion on this topic over the next few months.  Anyone that wants a copy of the entire Canadian Gas Potential Committee report should contact me at 402-398-7573 or go to the following web site:  www.canadiangaspotential.com  when our internet capability returns.  Lorna Energy Insight News for Thursday, September 20, 2001: Expectations fall for Canada's natural gas 'frontier' Canada's arctic north may not be North America's next big natural gas-producing basin after all. In what one geologist said was a ""major, major"" reduction in estimated natural gas potential, the Canadian Gas Potential Committee-a volunteer group of 50 geologists and other professionals who assess Canada's undiscovered gas potential-last week reported that Canada's frontier basins, which include the arctic and Mackenzie Delta regions, may hold no more than 60 to 65 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas that ultimately could make it to market. The new estimate falls short of previous estimates that 300 to 400 tcf of gas could be found in the Beaufort Basin, the arctic islands and Mackenzie corridor. It was those estimates that helped encourage geologists, producers and a number of U.S.-based power plant developers to consider the north as almost a second Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Gas from that historically prolific yet now declining basin makes up around 15% of U.S. imports. ""We thought the gas was greener,"" said Rob Woronuk, a senior analyst with the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. Still more potentially bad news came from the committee's report. In what Woronuk said was an ""embarrassment,"" the committee has now decided that Canadian coalbed methane may have less of a role to play than was previously thought. The committee reversed the findings of its 1997 report that estimated coalbed methane could account for up to 270 tcf of Canada's overall 570 tcf natural gas resource. 
Alert 
September Forecast 
Alert ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Tue, August 22, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing: A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices Author: Zenker, Snyder, Moritzburke E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1320 , Alternate URL: http://www.cera.com/client/ce/alt/082200_18/ce_alt_082200_18_ab.html ********************************************************************** As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices for both power and natural gas, September looms as the start of the fall shoulder season. The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels. CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past, however, with power and gas markets producing strong year-over-year prices and little relief from summer levels, even with normal September weather. West-wide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June, a month with high power prices. In addition, compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows, leaving more expensive gas-fired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output. CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push on-peak prices in the West to 244 percent over September 1999 levels. Continued strong use of gas-fired generation in the West, as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances, will keep the pressure on gas prices. Topock prices are expected to average $4.45 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in September. These high September gas and power prices are driven by * Declining hydroelectric output. The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West, with rainfall historically boosting output in December. Approximately 16,400 average megawatts (aMW) will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the three-month period. This represents a net reduction in capacity of 6,900 aMW when compared with the recent June-August summer months and a reduction of 3,600 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels. * Higher, more variable power demand. The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September, and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a year's peak load event will occur in September. Spiking loads, however, can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather. Thus, power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September. * High levels of gas-fired generation. Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gas-fired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June 2000, a month with similar average demand and monthly average on-peak power prices in the $150-$178 per megawatt-hour (MWh) range, depending on the region. This strong pull on gas-fired plants will push deep into the generation resource base, driving prices upward. An additional 1.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day will be required for gas-fired generators in the US West compared with September 1999 levels. * Strong North American gas prices. Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summer's peak levels, as North American supplies remain tight. A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall. As a result, average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around $3.95 per MMBtu. An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the $4.50 mark. * Strong western basis differentials. The strong demand for gas to serve gas-fired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels, especially in the California markets. CERA expects a Topock-to-Henry Hub differential of $0.40 per MMBtu during September. Extended operational problems associated with El Paso's pipeline rupture would raise that outlook. Regional Power Market Drivers Hotter-than-normal August weather, transmission and generator outages, high natural gas prices, and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August. Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of $90 per MWh during the on-peak period and by $14 per MWh during the off-peak period. Mid-Columbia power prices, bearing the brunt of fire-induced transmission outages, experienced a jump from July price levels of $114 per MWh for the on-peak period and $20 per MWh in the off-peak period. Off-peak prices, which have averaged above $60 per MWh during the June-August period, are clearly defined by the production cost of gas-fired resources. On-peak prices during this same period, at over $100 per MWh in all regions in all months, have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator (see Table 1). A return to normal weather should drive West-wide loads down by 8,300 aMW in September from August levels. However, load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by 5,400 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels. These greater loads, coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of 3,600 aMW from last September's levels, will create supply tightness during September (see Tables 2 and 3). Hydroelectric, coal, and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve West-wide demand in September, even during much of the off-peak periods, requiring gas-fired resources to meet a significant portion of the load. Gas demand for power generation is expected to average 5.2 Bcf per day in September, down from over 5.9 Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic 1.7 Bcf per day compared with levels in September 1999. September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gas-fired generation, approximately $50 per MWh, with prices frequently higher as demand increases. As this summer has clearly demonstrated, prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight. Hot weather-induced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship. * Cooler- or hotter-than-normal weather in September, coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads, will produce a wide range of price outcomes. Under normal weather, on-peak power prices are expected to fall in the $113-$123 per MWh range, depending on location, representing a 244 percent premium to year-ago September prices (see Figure 1). The latest revision of the California Independent System Operator's (ISO's) imbalance energy market cap down to $250 per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September. CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well. Pacific Northwest Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least 1,100 aMW compared with those in the hotter-than-normal month of August, the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to 1,900 aMW over the same period (see Table 4). Thus, the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions. With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period, power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California. These price levels will continue to support the operation of the region's limited quantity of gas-fired generation. Mid-Columbia on-peak price levels are expected to average $118 per MWh in September. Off-peak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south. The expected September level of $54 per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets. California The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path 15 and those to the south. As in years past, hydro-depleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region. Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle, and energy from the nuclear and coal-rich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path 15 import limitations. This condition, which is expected to persist from September through November, allows Northern California to price at a premium. The expected monthly average on-peak Northern California price of $123 per MWh incorporates this dynamic. Notably, the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California, in part to capture locational price differences more effectively. Southern California, like the Southwest, will typically experience hot weather episodes in September. During these high demand periods, prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer. In addition, California as a whole should see average loads in September that are 4,600 aMW higher than those of September 1999. Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices. Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region, allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California. An $8 per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected, with Southern California on-peak prices averaging $115 per MWh. Off-peak prices of $53 and $47 per MWh for Northern and Southern California, respectively, reflect the continued need for gas-fired resources to support September off-peak loads. Rockies and Southwest An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies, a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning. Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West. A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North. Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads, with a September monthly on-peak price average of $113 per MWh and an off-peak price average of $43 per MWh. CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis. The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns, and a strong 7,600 MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other. Strong gas prices and occasional market tightness-induced price run-ups will maintain on-peak prices at the $115 per MWh level in September. Off-peak prices will, like those in Southern California, be buoyed by the high cost of gas-fired generation. A price level of $47 per MWh is expected for off-peak prices. Regional Gas Market Drivers The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America, with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition. Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States, the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile. The storage deficit now stands at approximately 350 Bcf, and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels. This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September. CERA expects a Henry Hub price of $3.95 per MMBtu during September. In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September, especially in California. Overall, total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from 10.1 Bcf per day during August to 9.8 Bcf per day during September (see Table 5). This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month. The recent price disconnects between the supply-rich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demand-charged California will persist. October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase. In general, winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West. The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads. Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan. On the other hand, healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season. The start-up of the new Alliance pipeline, which will draw gas to the Midwest, will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California. California Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America, although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near $1.00 per MMBtu before this weekend's pipeline explosion. Total imports into California reached record levels during July; total imports of 5.8 Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day (see Table 6). Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at 83 percent utilization. So far in August, pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate, running at 85 percent. These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California, and the pressure should continue during September. Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September, but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support. Total demand in the state should average 6.6 Bcf per day, down only slightly from August's total of 6.8 Bcf per day. Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly, but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand. The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately $0.50 per MMBtu for September (see Table 7). Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States, but the storage surplus in the region has eroded. In California, inventories are running lower than last year, and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September. The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes. Pacific Northwest Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown. So far this month, prices at Malin are averaging a $0.25 per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub. Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full; flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly 2.2 Bcf per day this month. Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity, and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide Malin-to-Topock differentials. Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong, and the wide north-south differentials within the West will likely hold through September. In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to 1.5 Bcf per day from 1.4 Bcf per day in August. This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels. For September CERA expects Malin prices to average $0.10 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand. Although the westward pull on supplies is strong, bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices. Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached 93 percent during July, with less than 200 MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity. Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply, and in general, the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin. Unlike in the past two summers, the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices. The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged $0.50 per MMBtu so far this month and $0.30 per MMBtu since June. Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by 200 MMcf per day relative to last summer, but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect. Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand, the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September. The San Juan-to-Henry Hub differential is expected to average $0.60 per MMBtu. As in the Rockies, differentials should narrow substantially in October. Rocky Mountains Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb. Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region; generation is still largely coal-based, and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal. CERA expects the heavy discount-current Rocky Mountain-to-Henry Hub differentials are around $0.90 per MMBtu-to persist through September. Local area demand is not expected to change during September. Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads; October demand should average 1.4 Bcf per day, up from August and September averages of around 1.2 Bcf per day. Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies, winter differentials are expected to stay in the $0.25 to $0.40 per MMBtu range. Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer. Next summer, pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer. Although pipeline expansion projects have been announced-Trailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summer-the new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer. CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by 300 MMcf per day next year. Western Canada After widening to over US$1.50 per MMBtu, the AECO-Henry differential has begun to narrow somewhat; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from $0.84 per MMBtu in July. With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow, differentials are likely to persist in the mid-US$0.70s per MMBtu for September. AECO is expected to be US$3.25 per MMBtu (C$4.53 per gigajoule) for September. Even with the start-up of the Alliance project, the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the two-tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs. This will result in differentials that will range between US$0.60 and US$0.75 per MMBtu throughout the winter. Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last year's levels. The pace of drilling (over 9,000 gas wells are expected this year) should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001. Supply is expected to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Sumas prices have been quite volatile, driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system. For September, Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US$0.05 per MMBtu. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

CERA Monthly Briefing 
Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates. Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered ""moot"" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. ""Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before"" capacity became available, ""it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted"" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were ""null and void."" The only ""relevant"" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. Richardson and Sempra ""clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted,"" Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies ""had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra,"" she noted. Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, ""Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates,"" Miller testified. 
I didn't realize the report that I sent out yesterday about the California Energy Commission's conclusions on the state's natural gas infrastructure was so long!  Here is a brief synopsis.  I hope this helps everyone.  I haven't had time to read the full report yet, but if I see a better summary come out, I'll send it to you as well. Lorna CEC Blames Overtaxed In-State Gas System for High Prices Confirming what the state's energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago, the California Energy Commission (CEC) staff last week released its final draft report on the state's natural gas infrastructure, concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher-than-average wholesale gas prices, particularly in the southern half of the state. But the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit. It concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in California. ""Market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks, but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in California,"" the report stated. Among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers, said the CEC report, which will go to the five-member commission for approval Aug. 22. It stressed encouraging the development of more ""independent"" gas storage facilities, and taking steps to more fully ""optimize"" storage, including an increase in its use by large end-users. As a backdrop to the study's conclusions, the CEC report noted that both upgrades of in-state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet ""growing demand in California and throughout the West."" If the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don't come online as scheduled, the CEC report said other state actions would be necessary, although it did not spell out what those might be. For the future, the report said that the CEC will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are ""key indicators"" of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state's natural gas infrastructure. The other steps recommended for action are: 1) encouraging more in-state natural gas production (the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives); 2) setting new ""design criteria and reliability standards"" for the state's gas system to reflect what the CEC calls ""the changing nature of natural gas demand, especially for electric generators;"" 3) establishing integrated planning of the state's pipeline and storage facilities; and 4) developing a ""natural gas curtailment scheme"" emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages. The 111-page report, ""Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues,"" prepared by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee for final adoption of the five-member politically appointed commission, assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply, pipeline capacity (both inter- and intrastate) and storage, with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the Pacific Northwest and the in-state pipeline constraints at the California-Arizona border. As part of the proposed implementation, the report recommends that the CEC work more closely with the California Public Utilities Commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is ""fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas"" during shortage periods. It also proposes that the CEC this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non-core, large energy-intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage. 
Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
El Paso South Mainline Shut-in Extended The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) has ordered all three of the pipes comprising El Paso Natural Gas' 1 Bcf/d South Mainline from Texas to California to remain closed until extensive tests can be done to ensure they are safe to operate. The order came in the wake of Saturday's explosion and fire that ripped through one of those lines, the 30-inch pipeline 1103, at a Pecos River crossing near Carlsbad, NM, killing 11 people. Because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of pipeline, OPS is directing El Paso to submit a corrective action plan for OPS approval that will identify all areas on approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may be subject to internal corrosion,"" said Kelley S. Coyner, head of the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for the OPS, in a prepared statement. The DOT ""is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the vicinity of Pecos River remain closed until such time that the department has determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate."" This is necessary to ""protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure 
El Paso Shines Up Line 2000 for Gas Conversion El Paso Natural Gas this week received approval to begin the internal cleaning of its Line 2000, which would convert the former All American oil pipeline to gas service. The internal cleaning, or ""pigging,"" will begin at the La Paz pump station, and when this portion of the conversion is completed, the project will add about 230 MMcf/d of new capacity by Aug. 31. El Paso bought the line from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. in early 2000.  It extends 1,088 miles from Emidio, CA, to McCamey, TX. The purchase also included any fiber optic rights that All American had along its entire 1,233-mile system. 
Aquila Signs Long-Term Deal with APEA Aquila Energy said it has been awarded a $550 million long-term contract to supply 154 Bcf of natural gas over 12 years to members of the American Public Energy Agency (APEA). It is the fourth contract the agency has awarded to Aquila since 1998. ""With the future of gas prices becoming more and more unknown because of increasing demands and tightening supply, our members will benefit greatly from this long-term contract,"" said Roger Mock, president and chief executive officer of APEA. Under the three previous contracts with APEA Aquila is supplying the agency with 14.4 Bcf of gas over ten years, 91 Bcf over 12 years and 141 Bcf over 12 years. All together, Aquila is providing APEA with more than 400 Bcf over the next 12 years. APEA provides a reliable supply of natural gas to many municipal utilities and other public entities throughout the United States. These public buyers serve thousands of homes and businesses. ""Our strategy is to provide our customers with the most effective portfolio of services, both financially and physically, to enhance their competitive position in managing their energy needs,"" said Tom McCarthy, vice president of structured transactions for Aquila Energy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UtiliCorp to Re-Acquire and Then Become Aquila UtiliCorp United announced plans to buy back the 20% of its trading and risk management arm, Aquila Inc., that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name. The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes. Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industry's largest trading house, Enron Corp. On this busy Wednesday, UtiliCorp also released its earnings, and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary. 
Note:  Add this to the NOAA and Salomon Smith Barney forecasts.  LB WSI Sees Mild Winter in Northeast, Cold in West In contrast to forecasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Salomon Smith Barney of a colder-than-normal winter in key energy consuming regions, WSI Corp.'s end-of-October update to its seasonal forecast for November, December and January predicts warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and in the central and southern Plains. WSI, however, said it expects cooler-than-normal temperatures in the Gulf Coast states, Northern Plains, Great Lakes states, and all areas west of the Rocky Mountains. 
Price Spikes or Reliability Problems - CERA Monthly Briefing 
Note:  The following CERA analysis speaks to the California/Western markets.  I am also attaching a presentation I found from the Northwest Power Planning Council that has some insightful hydro predictions. See both of the reports below. Title: One Tight Winter Peak Remains *********************************************************************** WESTERN ENERGY--WINTER DEMAND PEAKS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PRICE SPIKES OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS Building natural gas and power supplies are providing a cushion for the western energy markets for this winter. Although seasonal gas and power demand spikes will again push prices higher, this winter will not look like the winter of 2000/01. Unlike during the record high gas and power prices and blackouts last year winter, reduced demand, increased gas storage levels, and new gas and power supplies will significantly temper prices and significantly reduce the risk of supply disruptions. *  A supply build of 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the Rockies and 900 MMcf in western Canada is meeting with declining demand in the West *  Fourth quarter power demand is expected to be 13 percent below levels last year, while over 5,000 megawatts of new supply has been added this year *  Only severe cold weather, prolonged drought, or a supply disruption could produce a reliability problem this winter 
Expansion 
Note:  This quick expansion was the result of FERC's expedited permitting process.  Lorna PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company's ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. ""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group's West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN's mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN's 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. ""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said. 
Note:  The track record for WSI seems to have been better than the CPC for the past few winters. Breaking News : posted Dec 4, 11:50 AM WSI Predicts Warmer-than-Normal Winter for Major Population Centers A warmer-than-normal winter is expected in the major population centers along the East Coast and Florida as well as the Southwest, while cooler-than-normal weather is predicted in the Plains, Great Lakes states, Pacific Northwest and the coastal sections of California, according to WSI Corp., which issued an end-of-November update to its seasonal forecast. 
Devon Energy and Santa Fe Snyder completed their $2.5 billion merger yesterday as shareholders of both companies approved the deal, which was announced in May. The agreement called for each Santa Fe Snyder common share to be converted into 0.22 shares of Devon common stock. Conversion requires issuance of 40.6 million additional Devon common shares, resulting in total shares outstanding of 127.7 million. Former Santa Fe Snyder shareholders now own 32% of the combined company. Historical Devon shareholders own 68% of the combined company. The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. With merger completion, Devon now ranks among the top five U.S.-based independent oil and gas producers in terms of market capitalization, total proved reserves and annual production. The company has an enterprise value of $9 billion and proved reserves of 1.1 billion boe. The company expects to realize $30 million to $35 million in annual cost savings from the merger. Devon was added to the S&P 500 Index after the close of 
AGA Confirms Plans to Continue Storage Survey Until May The American Gas Association (AGA) confirmed that it will continue its weekly storage report until May 1 following requests by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  In October, the association announced plans to discontinue the report on Jan. 2 because it drained resources committed to other programs more beneficial to AGA members. Subsequent to that announcement, the Energy Information Administration announced plans to begin its own weekly survey of natural gas storage levels, but the EIA said it could not have its survey system operational by Jan. 2. EIA requested that AGA continue its survey to avoid a lapse in information during the winter heating season. 
Note:  The assets for sale are in the Midcontinent, Rockies, and Gulf Coast areas.  They also play to put certain assets (like Valero) into their MLP.  LB El Paso to Sell Gulf, Midcontinent, Rockies Assets El Paso Corp. added a little more flavor to its $2.25 billion divestiture plan for next year, pinpointing three major locations -- the Gulf of Mexico, Midcontinent and the Rocky Mountains -- as areas where assets will be sold by the second quarter of 2002. The plan, part of a massive overhaul by the management team within the past few days, comes as El Paso shores up its balance sheet triggered in part by Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy and a host of other problems that have hit the energy industry this year. 
Kinder Morgan to Buy Enron's Share of Trailblazer Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P. announced Wednesday it has signed a definitive agreement with Enron Trailblazer Pipeline Co. to acquire its 33.3% share for $68 million cash. This will give KMP 100% ownership in the 436-mile line out of the Rockies into the Midwest. Kinder Morgan is the operator of the pipeline that runs from Rockport (Weld County), CO, to Beatrice (Gage County), NE. 
Executive News: PNM terminates merger with Western Resources Albuquerque, N.M.-based PNM Resources announced Tuesday its board had officially killed the proposed deal to buy Western Resources' electric utility subsidiaries. The deal, originally valued at over $4 billion, had been in trouble for months, and each side sued the other in state court in New York. PNM said the merger could be terminated after Dec. 31 under the terms of the deal, if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards completing the transaction. But Western has disputed that PNM had grounds to back out of the deal. PNM sued Western in October seeking to get out of the deal alleging breach of contract, in part because of adverse rulings from the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) on rates and a Western restructuring plan considered vital to the transaction. Western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later, seeking at least $650 million in damages against PNM for alleged extortion, breach of contract, sabotage and improper interference in the KCC proceedings. Neither case has been decided, although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Western's case or delay action on it until after it has decided PNM's initial suit. Western also has appealed the KCC order blocking a planned restructuring in preparation for the PNM transaction to a Kansas district court.

California Markets Named Westpath Expansion 
Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
FERC Approves North Baja Pipe The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
Calpine Announces Development of 600-MW Energy Center Calpine Corporation announced that through a development agreement with Adair International Oil and Gas, Inc. it has secured the rights to develop, build, own and operate a 600-MW natural gas-fired electricity generating facility near the town of Thermal in Riverside County, CA. The $275 million Teayawa Energy Center will be located on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians' land through a long-term lease agreement between Calpine and the Torres Martinez. Construction of the project may begin as soon as mid-2001, with commercial operation slated to begin in late 2003. The project will interconnect with an existing transmission line adjacent to the property. As the power project is located on Native American land, the lead permitting agency under the National Environmental Policy Act is the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Additionally, BIA approval is necessary to ensure that the Teayawa Energy Center appropriately meets the cultural, environmental and economic

We will look at the Oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our pipe--with the switch in ownership, they may be receptive to strategy changes. Lorna PanCanadian Says Montana Power Purchase 'Beautiful Fit' To extend what it sees as dominance in Canada's natural gas market and to boost its production by 10%, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. yesterday agreed to purchase Montana Power Co. for $475 million. The properties will extend PanCanadian's existing shallow gas properties in southern Alberta into northern Montana, adding 94 MMcf/d and 3,800 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids. The acquisition will give PanCanadian properties in Alberta, Montana, Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming, along with three gas pipelines linking Alberta and Saskatchewan to Montana.

El Paso South System Flows 700 MMcf/d Less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system in southeastern New Mexico, the pipeline last week had more than 700 MMcf/d of its 1.1 Bcf/d capacity restored to its South Mainline that services markets between Texas and California. At mid-day Friday, El Paso said it began running about 260 MMcf/d through Line 1100 after it received the go-ahead from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), according to spokeswoman Kim Wallace. El Paso was able to re-start partial service on the 26-inch line after it built a 16-inch temporary connector line between Line 1110 and Line 1100, which was approved by OPS. The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion site, about 30 miles from Carlsbad, NM. Wallace said Line 1100 would carry the gas from Eunice, NM, just Northeast of the Pecos River Compressor Station, to the connector with Line 1110, which then would transport it westward across the Pecos River Bridge where it would meet up with Line 1100 further downstream. Meanwhile, Wallace said El Paso submitted to OPS last week the test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line 1100. Three days prior, the OPS had given El Paso permission to restore service to Line 1110 from the Keystone Station through the Pecos River Compressor Station at a reduced level. The pipeline re-opened the line at about 400 MMcf/d, and gradually increased it to 480 MMcf/d by Friday. This is ""still within the limits it [OPS] set"" for Line 1110, Wallace said. The OPS restricted El Paso's Line 1110 to 80% of the operating pressure of Line 1103 at the time it ruptured, according to Department of Transportation spokeswoman Debbie Hinz. She said this put the line at a pressure of about 538 pounds per square inch. The OPS-ordered shutdown of Line 1110 lasted 10 days, during which the agency ordered El Paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic, ultrasound and X-ray tests to determine its safety, and to submit a plan for restoring service to the line. As for the future of ruptured Line 1103, Wallace said repairs on it would not begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed, which will 
Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
Note:  See gas quality section at the bottom that they propose adding on their other pipelines, like they have on NGPL. Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run around FERC's Order 637, filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff procedures to avoid the more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer protests. Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories, Indicated Shippers said. They include imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality, point allocations, curtailment priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental purchase and sale, capacity release, unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous. Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316), saying ""most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI to implement elements of Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity for meaningful review and comment by KMI's customers."" Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and comment on usually routine tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted 30 days for comments on Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to make compliance filings June 15. KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed at changing its tariff to reflect ""the current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.."" It did acknowledge, ""A number of the changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's 
Texans Bake as Electricity Usage Hits Record By today, a ""cool"" spell was expected to grip Texas, plunging temperatures down to around 100. A nice respite from the 105-plus temperatures that stilled the state and sent electricity peak loads to new records last week for the third time this year. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an industry coalition that administers the state's power grid and serves 85% of the state's electric load, reported Friday that preliminary numbers indicated that electricity usage reached an all-time peak high for the third time in 44 days last Thursday, with Texans using 57,731 MW of power. Of course, that was before the weekend, when temperatures were expected to climb as high as 112 at some locations in the state --- just in time for Labor Day picnics. The new usage record last Thursday broke the previous record set the day before, on Wednesday, when consumers used 55,994 MW of power. The two broken records broke a record set just six weeks earlier, July 19, when Texans used 55,796 MW of power. Peak load in August 1999 was 54,849 MW of power, while peak load in August

Prudential Sees Bull Market Running Two More Years With gas futures prices soaring past $5, now is not a bad time to raise price forecasts and expectations for the coming winter and next year. Prudential Securities did just that yesterday, upping its predictions on spot wellhead prices to $4.10 for the second half of the year, $3.55 for all of 2000 and $3.65 for 2001. ""[W]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a 'lay up,'"" the investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas fundamentals. Below average storage inventories and increasing gas-fired electric generation demand should keep the bull market running, the report stated. Prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 Bcf, or 11% below last year's level. ""This is assuming that the average injection rate is at or above the eight-year historical average during that period, and so far this year refills have been at or below the historical average. Depending on the winter weather, the industry typically consumes 2,000-2,500 Bcf out of storage inventories, which would likely bring storage levels down 
EIA Predicts Supply Shortfall Will Linger Through Winter The Energy Information Administration said yesterday in its September Short-Term Energy Outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead will increase by about 87% this winter (October-March) compared to last winter. Residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27% compared to last year. For the entire year, the average wellhead price for natural gas is projected to be $3.40/Mcf, the highest annual wellhead price on record (in inflation-adjusted terms, it would be the highest annual average price since 1985). The short-term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry's ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are likely to continue into the heating season, EIA said. Storage levels could end up being about 8% below the five-year average of about 3,000 Bcf by the start of winter if net injections continue at 10% below historically average rates through the remainder of the refill season. The effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the form of significantly increased production until after the next heating season, according to the agency's report. ""For now, we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001, with assumed increases of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, for this year and next...,"" the EIA report stated. ""On the other hand, the U.S. natural gas rig count on Aug. 25 was at a recent high of 794 rigs. Exploration and production budgets for many natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001, spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues from producing assets. Also on the positive side, data from the Texas Railroad Commission suggest that, through May, year 2000 gas production increased, if only slightly (0.4%). This signifies a turnaround (however modest) in a key producing region. Very high gas drilling rates, including a record-setting pace in deep offshore Gulf of Mexico, confirm that 
Northern Natural Gas declared a force majeure after discovering a leak in its 20-inch Plymouth to Mitchell line in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. Teams isolated the leak, NNG said Wednesday, and the approximate downtime was expected to be two days. Flow was scheduled to zero at the Shell Tippett, Burlington, Marathon Yates and Southern Union receipt points. El Paso reported raising maximum flow through Pecos River Station, near the site of a pipeline explosion Aug. 19, from 700 MMcf/d to 750 MMcf/d effective on Wednesday's business day. El Paso will continue to evaluate the available throughput level while operating under the federal Department of Transportation's Corrective Action Order on allowable pressures in the Pecos 
El Paso Open Season Was 'Rigged,' CPUC Says Armed with a ""smoking gun"" discovered in just-released data, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has launched a fresh offensive against El Paso Natural Gas' 1.22 Bcf/d transportation contract arrangement with affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. Based on information uncovered in an internal e-mail, the CPUC now contends that the open season last February for one third of El Paso's firm transportation capacity was ""rigged"" to show preference to El Paso Merchant. The e-mail revealed that during the open season El Paso Merchant had ""secretly negotiated"" a two cents/MMBtu transportation discount rate on Mojave Pipeline, another El Paso affiliate, for service from Topock to Southern California Gas at Wheeler Ridge for quantities above 100,000 MMBtu/d effective March 1, 2000, the CPUC told FERC. The interruptible discount would last the entire 15 months of the new contracts offered in El Paso Natural Gas' open season, state regulators said, adding that Mojave had withheld announcing the discount until Feb. 18 --- after El Paso's open season had ended. The discounted capacity on Mojave was critical, given that FERC previously had ruled that about half of the 1.22 Bcf/d El Paso capacity (Block II capacity) could not directly access the SoCal-Topock delivery point. As a way around this restriction, bidders in the El Paso open season knew they could use El Paso capacity to access Mojave Pipeline at Topock, and then have their gas shipped to SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, the CPUC said. But what they didn't know was that Mojave had negotiated a discount with El Paso Merchant, the commission noted. The shippers were operating under the assumption that the IT rate still was four cents/MMBtu, which it had been for the previous 18 months. The information about the discount was disclosed in a Feb. 9 e-mail written by El Paso Merchant Vice President Robin Cox, which acknowledged that ""Mojave is willing to offer"" a two cent/MMBtu discount rate for volumes above 100,000 MMBtu/d. ""I will not officially request this discount until next Wednesday assuming we win the capacity,"" the executive wrote. ""After it is posted, it 
Note:  Alliance announced an October 30 official in-service date for tariff services; however, they will be selling test gas in ramp up period.  Right now, these first deliveries are going into the ANR system because it is the only interconnect that is ready. Alliance Delayed, But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up After months of speculation in the industry, Alliance Pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct. 30. When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago, Oct. 2 was the target date for commercial service. However, the delay doesn't mean the market won't be getting any Canadian gas out of Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling 50-100 MMcf/d of gas into the market. It intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full 1.325 Bcf/d load prior to switching to commercial service on Oct. 30, said spokesman Jack Crawford. ""We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas. Right now I think we are dealing with three or four different marketers. Our initial deliveries right now are into the ANR system. That's because its basically the only connection that is ready, but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all. ""I'd be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases of 100 MMcf/d each week] but that's kind of the game plan,"" said Crawford. ""On Oct. 29 it will be Alliance selling [1.325 Bcf/d of] test gas, and on Oct. 30 it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other. The market may not see much of a difference. We obviously don't want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked 
Locations 
El Paso, Coastal Consolidate Pipeline Staff El Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said. The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II. Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern region headquartered in Birmingham, AL. John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J. Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C. Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James Yardley will report to Somerhalder. ""This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's pipeline system,"" said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. ""Our upcoming merger with Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation, border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and

American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=3D5526&m=3D1357 , Alternative URL:=20 http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/091500_16/nag_alt_091500_16_ab.html ********************************************************* As the heating season approaches, a high=01*but justified=01*level of anxie= ty regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market. As things stand, the= =20 market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter= =20 even under normal weather conditions. This prospect has placed a floor on the ga= s price at the price of residual fuel oil, itself priced in the mid- to upper= =20 $4.00s range. Gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market, diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply=20 concerns again. To the upside, there is little demand response to price until=20 industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil, as of this writing near $7.0= 0=20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), is breached. However, distillate=20 markets themselves are extremely tight, and prices for that fuel would likely follo= w=20 gas prices up. Within this range, prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety= =01*the market=01,s judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall, which would b= e characterized by extreme pricing and volatility, and a difficult process of= =20 supply allocation by price. By now, exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain. Althou= gh CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately 2.0 billion cu= bic feet (Bcf) per day from August to September, this increase would still leav= e inventories at record lows for this month and next. Even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms, or if hot weather returns. For October, heating load enters the picture. With US supplies running clos= e=20 to year-earlier levels and imports slightly higher, demand priced out of the= =20 market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from las= t=20 year=01,s low level. As a result, although prices may close the month of September in= =20 the upper $4.00s per MMBtu, at the high end of the competitive range with resid= , any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward=20 during the remainder of September or in October. As the heating season begins, therefore, CERA expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter = to result in the first ever monthly average price of $5.00 at the Henry Hub (s= ee Table 1) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price. Gas Storage=01*New Record Lows CERA estimates that storage inventories in the United States crossed into= =20 record low territory as of the end of August, when inventories of 2,233 Bcf fell= =20 below the previous 1996 record low of 2,245 Bcf (see Table 2). More records will likely be broken in the coming months, and by widening margins. Injections = for September are expected to average 9.5 Bcf per day, an increase of 2.0 Bcf p= er day from the August level but below last year=01,s pace of 10.3 Bcf per day= . CERA=01,s September estimate could be exceeded under mild weather condition= s with no tropical activity hitting the Gulf of Mexico, but injections would= =20 likely fall below the 9.5 Bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation = of platforms. This rate would leave US inventories at 2,518 Bcf at month=01,s = end, a record low by 87 Bcf. For October, CERA expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last= =20 year. Injections of 5.5 Bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema= nd priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropica= l storm activity. October injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf pe= r=20 day (1989) to 8.5 Bcf per day (1998). Even if injections reached toward the upp= er end of this range, the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter. At the expected injection rate, US inventories of 2,689 Bcf at the= =20 end of October would result in an end of March 2001 inventory level of 669 Bcf und= er normal winter weather, 89 Bcf below the previous record low of 758 Bcf. Regional Markets=01*Waiting for Winter The pipeline explosion on El Paso during late August intensified the=20 subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets. Cuts in pipeline flows=20 limited access into California on the only pipeline route into the state with any= =20 excess capacity. The lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the California market. Although summer power loads in California will ease and much of the El Paso capacity has be= en restored, the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter= =20 heating load will keep intense pressure on Topock prices. Differentials in the rest= =20 of the West will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t= o ease pipeline bottlenecks (see Table 3). Differentials in the East, which have traded in a narrow range this summer,= =20 will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in= =20 October. However, exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this= =20 year. CERA=01,s outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during October. CERA expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity, differentials will narrow. October differentials should average $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. The resumption of flows on El Paso=01,s southern system, combined with production outages, has relieved some of the access constraints on San Juan supply. Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow October differentials to $0.35 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. The continuing pull on supplies from the West will support Permian prices, and the Midwestern pull on supplies will support Mid-Continent prices. CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of $0.06 per MMBtu for Mid-Continent supplies and $0.11 per MMBtu for Permian supplies. * Chicago. The delay in the in-service date for Alliance from October 2 to October 30 will take some gas out of the Chicago market next month. This delay, combined with the need to build Midwest storage inventories, should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the $0.05=01)$0.08 range to above $0.10 per MMBtu. CERA expects October differentials at the Chicago citygate to average $0.11. * Northeast markets. Gas prices near $5.00 have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast, raising the floor level for differentials to near $0.30 per MMBtu. The beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should support differentials above the floor during October, at near $0.40 per MMBtu. Canadian Markets=01*Outages Affect Supply Outages have affected supply thus far in September. Both British Columbia a= nd Alberta have been affected, resulting in a further year-over-year decline i= n Western Canadian supply. The various problems appear to be rectified, but t= he average supply for the month is likely to be down 100 to 150 million cubic= =20 feet (MMcf) per day from September 1999. Drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet=20 weather, but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels. More th= an 8,400 gas wells are expected for this year. Slight Drop in Export Demand Eastern Canadian demand is still down approximately 200 MMcf per day, with cooler-than-normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning. In the W= est however, cooler-than-normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand for heating requirements of about 200 MMcf per day. Exports are down slightly in September compared with September 1999, with PG&E GT-NW off 110 MMcf per day. Northern Border is running even with September 1999. Storage Picture Brighter in Canada Storage injections in eastern Canada have picked up, with inventories now expected to reach the five-year average of 210 Bcf. In the West, inventorie= s=20 at the end of the injection season will not only be above the five-year level = but should be even with those of 1999, at 250 Bcf. Wider Differentials Holding After widening substantially in August to US$1.17, the AECO-to-Henry differential has closed back to a more typical level of $0.60 in September. September=01,s AECO price should average US$4.15 per MMBtu (C$5.79 per gigajoule [GJ]), increasing in October to US$4.35 per MMBtu (C$6.07 per GJ)= . **end** ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at= =20 http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Sempra Could Be Takeover Candidate, Newspaper Says The London Telegraph newspaper quoted an analyst who said that U.K.-based Centrica could be eyeing Sempra Energy as a possible takeover candidate following Centrica's purchase of Canadian gas and electricity supplier Direct Energy. Direct Energy owns a 27.5% stake in Energy America, whose remaining equity belongs to Sempra. The newspaper quoted Simon Hawkins, an analyst with UBS Warburg, as saying the Direct Energy acquisition is ""step one of something much bigger."" In principle, he said, there is no reason why Centrica shouldn't go after Sempra. Centrica told the newspaper it was ""talking to Sempra about

Olympian Status for U.S. Gas Market Just so you'll know: ""The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across dozens of products. It's something everyone should be proud of,"" Robert Levin of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday. ""The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of market conditions with hundreds, if not thousands of market participants, using an extraordinary selection of market instruments,"" Levin continued, adding that the Commission should be supporting the ""growth and increased 
Transportation Notes El Paso Natural Gas issued an emergency notice Monday, reporting that the Bondad 2A turbine must be taken down to repair an oil leak today. The work will reduce the capacity of the station by 95 MMcf/d.

Note:  Ken Lay's comments at the ""Governors' Natural Gas Summit:  Responding to the Growing Energy Crisis"" are quoted in this article. Industry Fears Consumer Backlash Because of High Prices The natural gas industry should be prepared to face customer revolts and attempts at price caps, similar to those witnessed this summer in San Diego if it's a cold winter and prices continue to hit new highs. That was the warning from government and industry representatives at the crisis conference held by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) yesterday. Representatives of producing states and industry speakers were unanimous in opposing government intervention to restrain prices, but no one had a ready remedy for consumer reaction if they are hit with a double whammy of greater energy use at higher prices this winter. One speaker offered a bright spot: the industry might emerge relatively unscathed if the winter is moderate. But then he added it's not just residential heating bills, but electric bills as well that will be impacted by higher natural gas prices. Others pointed out that demand and higher prices could spur lawmakers to open more areas to drilling and encourage new long lines. ""Industrial customers have been dealing with high prices for some time, but higher bills for residential and small commercial customers are just starting to hit the radar screen,"" Peggy Claytor, purchasing manager for steel-maker The Timken Co., told the group of more than 300 from the U.S., Canada and Mexico, meeting in Columbus, OH. ""We may see protests or proposals or calls for price caps this winter."" She said she is opposed to caps because they fail to solve the underlying problems, and she blamed the ""dysfunctional electricity grid"" in part for aggravating the run-up in natural gas prices. Asked whether he expected to see a public outcry from residentials this winter, Stephen L. Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary has borne the brunt of the California debacle (and whose 
Climate Prediction Center Winter  Outlook ? ??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South.

Note:  I'm sure you have this on your radar screen, but just in case you don't... PG&E Corp. announced that its National Energy Group will develop its first Nevada project, a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired generating plant to be located 45 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The merchant plant's main purpose is to supply Nevada, but when it is not needed there, it will add much-needed supply to the western energy market. The group hopes to begin construction during the fourth quarter of 2001, with completion expected in early 2004. ""Southern Nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the country,"" said Thomas B. King, president of PG&E NEG, West Region. ""Because of its location near Las Vegas, the Meadow Valley project will be ideally positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth."" Including the Nevada project, PG&E National Energy Group has a total of 4,000 MW in development or 
News Brief: +OGE Energy Corp.'s Enogex Subsidiary Sells Non-Core Assets OGE Energy Corp. said its Enogex Inc. subsidiary has closed on the sale of several assets no longer considered vital to its core business. These assets include interests in oil and gas-producing properties in Utah and three natural gas-gathering pipeline systems in Oklahoma. Terms of the transactions were not disclosed. Proceeds from the asset sales, totaling about $14 million, will be used to pay down short-term debt associated with Enogex's 1999 acquisition of Transok LLC. In Utah, Enogex sold all of its interests in its oil and gas properties, along with all related rights, equipment, real property, leases and agreements. In Oklahoma, Enogex sold the Piedmont and El Reno systems in Canadian County and the Fidelity gathering system in Oklahoma County, including all gathering lines, compressors and equipment along with related contracts and rights of way. The Oklahoma sale was to Seminole Gas Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Note:  The market reaction is interesting.  One can surmise that quite a bit of the gas that was contracted for on Vector is firm utility gas.  The run up in Chicago may be temporary until alternate arrangements are completed. Vector Delay Confirms Market's Suspicions Future shippers on the new Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline had their fears confirmed Tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start-up date for the project, which was scheduled for Nov. 1 to coincide with the start-up of the long-awaited Alliance Pipeline, would be delayed until Dec. 1. Vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered construction of the pipeline, which --- when completed --- would provide initial takeaway for about 700 MMcf/d of the 1.3 Bcf/d of western Canadian gas that will be shipped to the Chicago market by Alliance. Alliance is due to begin operations on Oct. 31. The announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million-dollar question: ""where will that [Alliance] gas go?"" in the meantime. Alliance officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and LDCs serving the Chicago hub that could pick up the slack between Oct. 31 and Dec. 1. Alliance's Jack Crawford downplayed the impact of the Vector start-up delay on Alliance. ""We don't think [there will be] much effect at all. We have been working closely with Vector. Our connection with them, if it's not ready, is very close. We also have five other connections with other [existing] pipelines and LDCs"" in Chicago. Many shippers ""understand [that with ] a startup the magnitude of ours [Alliance] and Vector's, there are likely to be

Lorna ---------------------------------------------------- Dear CERA Members and Friends: Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude prices?? What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful calculations? One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates' (CERA) core businesses has been benchmark crude oil price analysis. In our new multiclient study, ""The Hole in the Barrel"", CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the structure of the market itself.? We argue the limits and real economic losses that can result from misunderstanding these prices - specifically the Brent benchmark - in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning, the magnitude of which can be significant, often amounting to dollars - not cents - per barrel. As an introduction to this new study, we would like to invite you to participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web presentation on October 12, 2000.? With the current volatility and high levels of energy prices, this conference call will bring clarity to these important and relevant issues. To enroll for the call, please RSVP to 1-800-289-0579 or 719-457-2550 and reference the Confirmation Code 984848 in order to participate in the call. In this detailed study, CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk about the oil price.? As part of the study, we: * Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and consider their long-term future given the steady decline of ""wet"" barrels, including how other price markers might evolve. * Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues (for a given volume of production) than is generally appreciated. * Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices (absolute price level, time and grade differentials), to show where revenue is being lost and what can be done to add it back again. * Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming, especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that they help to manage. In this evolving New World, while trading may or may not be good for you, not understanding the market can be fatal. CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS: * Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of internationally traded crude oils. * The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate contracts in the Brent market to different sectors of the oil industry * The risks and rewards of dealing in the Brent market Our speakers will address this topic for 20-30 minutes, with accompanying graphics presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer period.

Coastal Corp. announced that Engage Energy U.S., L.P. has changed its name to Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which coincides with the split of the Engage Energy joint venture by participants Coastal and Westcoast Energy. Effective on Oct. 3, the operations were divided into separate entities which are owned and operated solely by each company. Coastal Merchant Energy, which handles up to 3.5 Bcf/d, appointed James C.

Kinder Morgan Transfers $300M in Assets to MLP Kinder Morgan, Inc. announced plans to contribute $300 million in assets to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., the company's master limited partnership. The largest asset to be contributed is Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, formerly MidCon Texas, a 2,600-mile natural gas pipeline system that extends from South Texas to Houston along the Texas Gulf Coast. Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing Systems, KMI's 50% interest in Coyote Gas Treating and KMI's 25% interest in Thunder Creek Gas Services. As consideration for the assets, KMI will receive $300 million, 50% in cash and 50% in KMP partnership units. KMI expects the transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. ""This transaction represents a true win-win for both KMI and KMP,"" said Kinder Morgan CEO Rich Kinder. ""It is expected to be accretive to cash available for distribution to KMP's unitholders by between 5-10 cents in 2001. The pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP because they complement existing KMP assets, have long-term contracts in place and offer significant growth opportunities."" Kinder noted that because the mix of consideration paid will include equity issued to KMI, it will not be necessary to raise funds for the transaction via a public offering of KMP units. ""KMI will also benefit from the transaction, as it will be able to reduce its debt by $150 million,"" Kinder said. ""Additionally, the transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share in 2001. By increasing its stake in the master limited partnership, KMI will enjoy 
Frontier Pipeline Project 
Note:  Williams does not give the amount of volume response they received in their open season.  540,000 Dth/d was their established volume at the onset.  Also, it is interesting that they are naming the Oklahoma intrastate markets as their market for the project. Western Frontier Pipe Gets Rave Reviews After successfully completing a non-binding open season on Sept. 21, for the Western Frontier project, Williams' gas pipeline unit plans to hold a binding open season in the near future to gauge the exact market interest in the project that would transport gas supply from the Rockies to the mid-continent region. ""We are very pleased with the interest the market has shown in our Western Frontier Project. We continue to believe that Western Frontier will be a cost-effective way to bring economically-priced Rockies supply into the mid-continent,"" said Kim Cocklin, vice president of customer services and rates for Williams' Central and Texas Gas pipeline systems. The Western Frontier Project is expected to transport up to 540,000 dth/d from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams' Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central system in southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton pipeline. The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Williams believes this project would be able to supply a ""seamless transport at an incremental cost"" to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central system. Through the Central system, customers would also be able to access storage including directly owned and third party storage fields. Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the mid-20 cents per dth. The company also expects a fuel rate of less than 1%. Expected to be in service during November 2003, the project will require the construction of almost 400 miles of pipeline and the addition of 13,000 HP. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Home Heating Costs to Soar this Winter Americans can expect home heating prices to jump as much as 44% this winter because of strong economic growth and high crude oil prices, according to the EIA. A winter with especially long periods of cold weather' could cause even higher prices because heating fuel storage levels are below average. Homes that use natural gas can expect to see the biggest jump in bills. Prices paid by residential customers are expected to average $8.58 per MMBtu, up about 30% from last winter's average of $6.61. The higher prices, combined with increased consumption, will push overall costs up to an average $780 this winter from $540 last year earlier, the EIA said in an annual report on winter fuels. High prices for competing petroleum-based fuels will help keep natural gas prices high. Homes with heating oil will pay about $949 for fuel this winter, up 25% from the $760  paid last winter. Prices will average about $1.37 per gallon, up 16% from last year's $1.18, the report said. The 4.5% of Americans who use propane to heat their homes will pay about 27% more this winter at $1,045, compared with $823 last year. Inventories of propane at the end of last month were about 62 million barrels, 3 million above last year's level. Distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, will be about 114 million to 118 million barrels at the start of the heating season, about 15% to 18% lower than last year, the report said. The government projection excludes the heating oil reserve created by the Clinton administration, which stores 2 million barrels. Distillate stocks in the East Coast are 41 million barrels, close to 40% less than last year's level. In New England stocks are over 60% below the 1999 level. The EIA estimated the monthly price of crude oil will remain above $28 per barrel for the rest of the year, and then gradually decline next year to an average $25 per barrel. Because of rising demand in Asia and continued growth in the US, higher oil production by OPEC has not been able to stem the rally in prices, the report said. US crude oil inventories are about 287 million barrels, 17 million barrels below last year. The deficit is smaller than last month, when there was a 26 million-barrel shortfall, though supplies are still 8% below normal and are not expected to move into the normal range before the end of winter, the report said.  Global oil demand this year is expected to increase 1.1 million barrels per day from last year and will grow by an additional 2 million barrels a day in 2001 to 78 million barrels a day, according to the report. The average retail price for gasoline, which was about $1.52 per gallon last week, will fall to about $1.46 per gallon in December and $1.40 by next March, the report said. The report says a very cold winter could cause Northeast heating oil prices to surge, and that could spill over into East Coast diesel markets. The government said the chances of this were greater this year because of tight distillate supplies, especially in the Northeast. Diesel prices will fall by about $0.09 to $1.55 per gallon in December and $1.35 by next summer, assuming normal conditions this

News Briefs: Chevron and Texaco Agree to $100 Billion Merger Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. announced plans to merge and ChevronTexaco Corp. In the merger, Texaco shareholders will receive 0.77 shares of Chevron common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron shareholders will retain their existing shares.  The exchange ratio represents approximately $64.87 per Texaco share based on Chevron's closing stock price of $84.25 on October 13.  The exchange ratio represents an 18% premium based upon Texaco's closing share price on October 13, and a 25% premium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during the 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron shareholders will own approximately 61% of the combined equity, and Texaco shareholders will own about 39%.  The combined company would have an enterprise value of more than $100 billion. The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and operations throughout the world.  In the U.S.,  ChevronTexaco would be the nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1 million BOE per day, and hold the nation's third largest reserve position,

Gas Storage--The Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20 approximately 8.5 Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag= e=20 5.5 Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of= =20 injections of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in= =20 futures prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of= =20 October. With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20 slowing of injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha= n=20 100 Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October. CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record= =20 low inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb= er. However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20 heating load from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic= h CERA estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,= =20 or even substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20 inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories= =20 will remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b= e=20 priced out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel= =20 oil. Regional Markets-Winter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start = of=20 winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri= ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20 between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t= he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with = the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset= =20 of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe= r=20 (see Table 3). CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load, but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November. * San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu for November. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should continue through November, with some slight widening in the Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively. * Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels, but there is little added delivery capacity into that market. CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s. Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20 uncertain. A line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of= =20 200-300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio= n=20 the pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20 quantities of gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses= s=20 precisely the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October = is=20 on par with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in= =20 2000, approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20 shallow trend does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected = to=20 produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl= y=20 build is expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive= =20 growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have= =20 accelerated; eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e= nd of=20 October. Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect= ed storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20 levels. PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord= er Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte= d=20 to be slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push= ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern= =20 Canadian demand. High Prices, Wide Differentials The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20 October. For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti= ng=20 AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at= =20 http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

FERC Staff Issues Favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on Guardian Pipeline The FERC Staff has issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement determining that construction of Guardian Pipeline would have limited environmental impact and would be an environmentally acceptable action, based on its proposed and other mitigation measures. The Draft covers the environmental aspects of constructing and operating the 149-mile Guardian Pipeline. FERC will take written public comments on the Draft until August 28th, and will conduct four public meetings along Guardian's route starting August 14th. It will address the comments before issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement on the project. A final decision on the Guardian Pipeline expected early next year. The Guardian Pipeline will transport volumes from interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern Gas Transmission, and NGPL at the Chicago hub to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets. The project will consist of a 25,000 horsepower of compression and 141 miles of 36 inch pipeline extending from Joliet to the Ixonia, WI, with an additional 8.5 miles of 16 inch pipeline extending from the main Guardian line to near Eagle, WI. 
ONEOK Acquires 56,200 Dth/d From Williams Williams and ONEOK reported yesterday that they have reached a two-year agreement in which Williams will provide incremental firm transportation service of 56,200 Dth/d to the Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) division of ONEOK. ""We have had a long-standing relationship with ONEOK through our service to its Kansas Gas Service division and we look forward to helping ONEOK serve its growing energy needs in Oklahoma,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president of Williams Gas Pipeline-SouthCentral (Central and Texas Gas systems). Service will begin on Nov. 1, and will require Williams to build two new meter stations along its existing pipeline system. A spokesman for ONG said the gas load from Williams was necessary to serve its steadily growing customer base of approximately 800,000 as the company unbundles its services. The transportation capacity will be used to serve customers in ONG's Oklahoma City and Enid, OK, markets. 
Alliance Deliveries Delayed until Nov. 13 In a move that is likely to send ripples through the market, particularly around Chicago, the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline extended its commercial in-service delay last week to Nov. 13 from Oct. 30. Pipeline officials said moisture and debris in the line caused the delay. ""As we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system 
Here is CERA's latest near term analysis. 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Thu, October 26, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Temporary Slack Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=3D5526&m=3D1402 , Alternative URL:=20 http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/102600_15/nag_alt_102600_15_ab.html ********************************************************* Warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the foc= us=20 in the gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growi= ng=20 sense that supplies might just prove adequate. The result has been a steady and= =20 steep decline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 into the $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t= he=20 mid- $5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua= l=20 fuel oil in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20 inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade= quate supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to= a=20 quick return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap. Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe= r=20 20 accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif= t=20 in market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima= tely=20 3.8 Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and = 58=20 Bcf above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob= er=20 22. With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20 expected next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o= n October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table= =20 1). Is this inventory level ""enough""? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter= =20 under 15- year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf= =20 above the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20 withdrawals in the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo= ve=20 last year=01,s withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac= e=20 of a return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul= d bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20 winter, holding withdrawals down requires both of the following: * Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down. These markets represent approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return, should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol. * The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas. In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,= =20 particularly as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20 demand can be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c= an=20 be held reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar= ch=20 1996 and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag= e=20 of $3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was= =20 nearly 4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa= s=20 lower, and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20 customers in the United States. Market fundamentals in CERA=01,s view still support gas prices above those = of=20 resid, which as of this writing is pricing in the $4.75-$5.00 per MMBtu range. War= m weather throughout November and into December could reverse this=20 relationship, but a warm October alone is insufficient, and any cold weather within the next = few weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the=20 market. CERA=01,s price outlook for November--an average of $5.50 at the Henry Hub-= - stands for now. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated table. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at= =20 http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

This is CERA's Western Market forecast for November. Lorna ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Tue, October 24, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: No Rest for a Weary Market Author: E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1400 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/ce/alt/102400_18/ce_alt_102400_18_ab.html ********************************************************* Rather than enjoying a respite, western energy markets will make November a catch-up month. Natural gas demand will remain high when compared with the same period last year, as gas-fired generation will continue to run at high utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal levels. The tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas prices, which will range from $5.15 to $5.83 per million British thermal units, depending on location. Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired generation on the margin for most of November. On-peak power prices will remain higher as a result, in the $86-$98 per megawatt-hour range, depending on location. **end** Follow URL for complete report. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

News : FERC Approves Independence, SupplyLink Projects 2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000 After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent agreements for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline and related SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two projects have been pending at FERC for more than three years. The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in Pennsylvania. The ""tentative"" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their downstream partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be operating a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and National Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an investment of about $1.5 billion. The Commission approved the ""greenfield"" Independence project over significant opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they were not convinced the new precedent agreements provided ""sufficient evidence"" of market support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at least 35% of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major player. The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the non-fee-based side. As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Note:  WEFA has made some interesting points in their conclusions of this study. Gas Turbines Headed for a 50% Meltdown High natural gas prices, performance issues and higher than expected maintenance costs, a general economic slowdown and several other key factors 
Note:  Raymond James and Associates is predicting gas prices to average $4.50 in 2001.  Consensus First Call estimates are now averaging $3.85 for 2001.  Read on to hear what the brokerage houses are predicting. Lorna Raymond James Sends Chills Up Gas Buyers' Spines Raymond James and Associates gave gas buyers a Halloween shriek yesterday that could be producing chills all the way through next April, perhaps even all of next year. The firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas prices this winter and said it expects prices to average $4.50/MMBtu in 2001. ""Regardless of a potentially warm winter, it is highly likely that the United States will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply,"" Raymond James said in its latest energy report. ""In other words, gas storage should test all-time low levels this winter regardless of weather. ""The situation should get worse, not better, next year. If we end the winter at all-time low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than we did this summer, then we should enter next winter with dangerously low levels of natural gas,"" Raymond James added. ""We believe that the United States will see gas demand increase by about 9 Bcf/d (or 15%) by the end of 2002 as new gas fired electric generation plants come on line. Unfortunately, even if every drilling rig is working, U.S. gas supply is likely to increase by less than 4 Bcf/d by the end of 2002. This means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over 5 Bcf/d of demand out of the gas supply/demand equation by 2002. At $5/Mcf, only about 1.5 Bcf/d of demand has been reduced so far. That means that gas prices must go 
Note:  There will be a briefing meeting on the project in Denver on Nov. 14 N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with direct access to several local distribution companies, including Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, NGPL, Northern and Vector. The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering ""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value. Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14.

Note:  FYI Fitch Puts 2 CA Utilities on Negative Watch In the midst of the continuing uncertainty over regulatory treatment of growing wholesale electricity cost under-collections, Fitch Tuesday assigned a ""rating watch negative"" designation to the securities of California's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison (and its parent company, Edison International). In addition, it lowered Edison's commercial paper rating one notch to ""F1"" from ""F1+"". Fitch cited the need for ""significant and extensive regulatory decisions"" to resolve the continuing problem of retail utility electric rate under-collections plaguing both utilities. It indicated that with the ""watch negative"" status, the independent rating service expects to review the ratings within six months. A spokesperson for PG&E Corp., the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric, said the Fitch move doesn't lower any of its ratings, but it ""underscores the seriousness of the situation (in California) and the need for all the parties to come together for a collaborative solution."" The companies have asked for relief from the California Public Utilities Commission (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). Edison is the target of an investors' lawsuit which accuses it of illegally booking as revenue the wholesale power costs that have yet to be collected. (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1). The Fitch move had no effect on PG&E's latest utility debt line extension of $1.3 billion that was implemented recently in response to the continuing under-collections, the spokesperson said. Fitch reiterated that through September the two utilities had booked under-collections exceeding $5 billion collectively and that wholesale power prices continue to exceed the utilities' frozen retail rate levels. ""While these amounts exceed immediate funding requirements, their recovery through rates is uncertain,"" Fitch stated in its announcement on the negative watch. ""Barring a change in regulatory policy, PG&E and SoCal Edison anticipate they will be unable to recover their under-collections before the end of the statutory rate freeze period ending March 31, 2002. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
El Paso extended an unauthorized overpull penalty situation yesterday for all customers. ""You are urged to immediately review your supply/demand balance, and the performance of your suppliers, to insure sufficient gas is being delivered to El Paso to cover the gas being taken off the system,"" the pipeline said. To ensure system integrity, El Paso is placing limits on scheduled volumes at interconnects that are underperforming.

PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 levels. The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit charge. ""We're just keeping our legal options open,"" said a San Francsco-based utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders. Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9 billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's 
Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural gas deliverability by the end of this year. NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and transportation-related services, structured power and management services and energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's existing asset valuation. Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with headquarters in Houston. ""By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three years,"" said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year. 
El Paso declared an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Thursday that will remain in effect until further notice. The pipeline said it will limit scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system integrity. Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance

NGPL Recontracts with NIPSCO Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter. Since Kinder Morgan took over NGPL parent KN Energy last year, the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the Midwest, including another deal announced yesterday with Northern Indiana Public Service (NIPSCO). NGPL and NIPSCO signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling 295,100 MMBtu/d of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and Dec. 1, 2001 and continuing through Nov. 30, 2002. They also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling 10.5 Bcf of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001 and continuing through March 31, 2003. NIPSCO, a NiSource subsidiary, is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly 700,000 customers and electricity to 416,000 customers across the northern third of Indiana. ""Virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year,"" said NGPL President Deborah Mcdonald in an interview. ""Basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year. We've been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [NiGas, NIPSCO and Peoples]."" Despite increasing competitive pressure from Northern Border and Alliance Pipeline, the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators. ""In contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the Midcontinent and Louisiana to Chicago, we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core LDCs. Obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with Aquila Energy for 500,000 MMBtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts,"" Mcdonald said. ""We also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power generators. Growth in NGPL will come from natural gas-fired generation. You probably saw our press release about the Ameren contracts for [construction of 1,700 MW of generation along the NGPL system]. In the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3,000 MW of gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 MW next year as well [which would represent up to 900 MMcf/d in gas transportation capacity]. ""Obviously another challenge is going to be [the 1.325 Bcf/d] Alliance Pipeline coming into the market this fall. It's anyone's guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time. I think a lot of that will be coming into Chicago and moving back out on Vector. But we're ready at Hub America to kind of serve as a giant header system [with Texas Eastern as

Sempra Could Be Takeover Candidate, Newspaper Says The London Telegraph newspaper quoted an analyst who said that U.K.-based Centrica could be eyeing Sempra Energy as a possible takeover candidate following Centrica's purchase of Canadian gas and electricity supplier Direct Energy. Direct Energy owns a 27.5% stake in Energy America, whose remaining equity belongs to Sempra. The newspaper quoted Simon Hawkins, an analyst with UBS Warburg, as saying the Direct Energy acquisition is ""step one of something much bigger."" In principle, he said, there is no reason why Centrica shouldn't go after Sempra. Centrica told the newspaper it was ""talking to Sempra about 
News Brief: +OGE Energy Corp.'s Enogex Subsidiary Sells Non-Core Assets OGE Energy Corp. said its Enogex Inc. subsidiary has closed on the sale of several assets no longer considered vital to its core business. These assets include interests in oil and gas-producing properties in Utah and three natural gas-gathering pipeline systems in Oklahoma. Terms of the transactions were not disclosed. Proceeds from the asset sales, totaling about $14 million, will be used to pay down short-term debt associated with Enogex's 1999 acquisition of Transok LLC. In Utah, Enogex sold all of its interests in its oil and gas properties, along with all related rights, equipment, real property, leases and agreements. In Oklahoma, Enogex sold the Piedmont and El Reno systems in Canadian County and the Fidelity gathering system in Oklahoma County, including all gathering lines, compressors and equipment along with related contracts and rights of way.

FERC Staff Issues Favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on Guardian Pipeline The FERC Staff has issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement determining that construction of Guardian Pipeline would have limited environmental impact and would be an environmentally acceptable action, based on its proposed and other mitigation measures. The Draft covers the environmental aspects of constructing and operating the 149-mile Guardian Pipeline. FERC will take written public comments on the Draft until August 28th, and will conduct four public meetings along Guardian's route starting August 14th. It will address the comments before issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement on the project. A final decision on the Guardian Pipeline expected early next year. The Guardian Pipeline will transport volumes from interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern Gas Transmission, and NGPL at the Chicago hub to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets. The project will consist of a 25,000 horsepower of compression and 141 miles of 36 inch pipeline extending from Joliet to the Ixonia, WI, with an additional 8.5 miles of 16 inch pipeline extending from the main Guardian line to near Eagle, WI.

News : FERC Approves Independence, SupplyLink Projects 2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000 After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent agreements for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline and related SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two projects have been pending at FERC for more than three years. The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in Pennsylvania. The ""tentative"" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their downstream partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be operating a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and National Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an investment of about $1.5 billion. The Commission approved the ""greenfield"" Independence project over significant opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they were not convinced the new precedent agreements provided ""sufficient evidence"" of market support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at least 35% of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

CERA Alert 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, July 07, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Power Market Caps: Lower Prices at Higher Risk? Author: Zenker, Mortizburke E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1264 , Recent events in California, culminating in new market rules established for the energy and ancillary services markets, indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they established. The hot weather in California during June triggered high electricity demand, corresponding record-breaking power prices, and rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area. Although the economic impact of both the outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant, a recent decision by California's Independent System Operator (ISO) to intervene in the markets by lowering price caps through the summer of 2000 from $750 to $500 per megawatt-hour (MWh) may prove to be the most important product of the market events.* Ironically, the proclivity to continue to change the market rules, whatever the intention, could create market distortions that delay the addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and driving away needed capit! al. This would only prolong the state's supply shortage and resultant high prices. Although the record-setting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in the San Francisco area is not likely to be repeated, the West as a whole will experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this summer. CERA expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand this year, but the high price levels of June will be repeated during peak demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of 2001 and possibly 2002. The Pressure Builds The blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall, but instead by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient quantities of power to the San Francisco area. The quantity of generating capacity out of service in the West was near average levels, despite a nuclear unit outage in Washington. Although the blackouts were brief and wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures, the intense scrutiny over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they designed. The market's architects assumed that competition would lower wholesale prices in the state. However, prices in June have been roughly eight times higher than in 1997's prerestructured California market, leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are flawed, requiring additional caps and market rules. Although some state officials strongly favored lo! wering the price caps, many within the ISO's Board of Governors strongly opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to tight supply and demand fundamentals. The current tight supply situation in California and the West as a whole is a product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with the slow process of permitting new power plants. Owing to strong economic growth in California in 1998 and 1999 (5.2 and 5.5 percent, respectively*), capacity margins have shrunk from 12 percent in 1997 to 7 percent in 2000. Demand growth throughout the West has reduced the amount of energy available for export from the Pacific Northwest and Southwest to California. As a result, even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the curtailment of approximately 2,800 megawatts (MW) of interruptible load within the state, California capacity margins will fall well below North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reliability criteria (roughly 15 percent) this summer. The West is the only region in North America that will experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in 1999 under normal weather conditions. CERA anticipates peak demand growth to continue to outpace new capacity additions through 2001, with slightly growing capacity margins in 2002. At these levels, an unusual amount of either plant capacity or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions would require the ISO to mandate blackouts of a portion of the state's load to maintain the overall stability of the grid. Thus, the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure prices to high levels, which may provoke legislators and regulators to attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rules. Market Distorting Effects Under tremendous pressure from some legislators, regulators, and market participants, the California ISO Board of Governors lowered the current price caps on energy from $750 to $500 per MWh in a special meeting conducted June 28.** Owing to the interconnectedness of western markets, the decision to lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to change the rules governing California's electricity markets will affect power market participants throughout the West. * Profitability of existing and future generators degraded. High power prices and volatility levels in June, although detrimental to most buyers, provide strong encouragement to plant developers. Limiting the level of price fly-ups degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a return on that capital. In most periods of the year, competition drives prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital. Generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in California's energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply scarcity. Existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the imposition of caps. * Supply shortfall prolonged. The process of siting and permitting power plants in California is cumbersome, requiring as long as five years from plant proposal to synchronization with the grid. The California Energy Commission (CEC), the state agency charged with approving new plants, has repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the state. Price-dampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that California officials may continue to reengineer the state's power markets to the detriment of generator profitability and, when added to the difficult permitting process, potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to meet rapidly growing state demand. Prominent plant developers have recently indicated that markets outside of California may provide a more stable market and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating equipment such as turbines. * Trading positions affected. Lowering price caps reduces the degree of price volatility and the level of overall average prices. Market participants have executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous, higher price cap. By lowering the price cap, not only are the value of existing physical (e.g., power plant) and financial (e.g., forward contracts) positions significantly affected, but market participants must also incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into their trading.* * Circumventing market rules. The variety of energy and capacity markets in California, as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state, provides opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules, further distorting the markets in the West. Although lowering price caps in California will likely temporarily reduce price levels, the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in the market. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert.

But the meetings did serve to highlight divisions within the three negotiating blocks and identify the most contentious areas for future discussion. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/22/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Hitting Retail Energy Over the Net: e-Commerce Companies Join the Game Author: Robertson, Behrens, Biehl E-Mail Category: Private Report Product Line: Retail Energy Forum,Energy & e-Business URL: For Retail Energy Retainer Service members: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/ref/pr/062100_12/ref_pr_062100_12_ab.html For e2 Business Retainer Service members: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/e2/pr/062100_12/e2_pr_062100_12_ab.html Summary: The retail energy industry and the Internet are becoming increasingly interlinked. The past 12 months have seen the formation of a wave of new retail energy businesses seeking ways to utilize the Internet to create a ""new"" retail energy industry. The difference is that this ""new"" industry will invert the energy supply chain and be built from the demand side (customer end) back upstream. This fosters a new role for customers and their relationship with suppliers, an expansion in the number and types of products and services being offered, and a change in the composition of the companies involved in this segment. In this Private Report we analyze these new entrants, their business models, and the prospects for success in what to date has been a difficult marketplace. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/02/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Turkish Parliament Votes on the Blue Stream Tax Protocol Author: Vatansever E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Eurasia Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/fsu/alt/060200_17/fsu_alt_060200_17_ab.html Summary: The last remaining obstacle to the Blue Stream gas pipeline project between Russia and Turkey appears about to be cleared away. Over the past two days the Turkish parliament has been debating a key tax protocol connected to the project. CERA believes the measure is very close to passage, as the Turkish governing coalition has successfully resolved its internal differences over Blue Stream. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: More Oil Is Coming into the Black Sea: Will It Cause a Bosphorus Crisis?

Author: Puyana, Scott E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/db/060500_11/la_db_060500_11_ab.html Summary: Colombia is expected to begin an economic recovery in 2000 after a contraction of over 5 percent in 1999. Despite this expansion, unemployment levels will remain stable at 19 percent, and losses incurred by companies, by individuals, and by the government through lower tax revenues during the last nine quarters of negative economic growth will not be recovered this year. The administration of Andr,s Pastrana Arango faces the difficult challenge of getting the economy back in shape at a time when his popularity is waning. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/09/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: ANP Round Two: Brazil's Upstream Auction? Author: Scott, Mattos E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/060900_16/la_alt_060900_16_ab.html Summary: The opening of Brazil's upstream oil sector has taken another step forward this week following the successful ANP auction of 21 blocks. This bidding round comes one year after ANP's first round, held in June 1999. The bid was well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in Brazil. Although the ANP collected lower participation fees than in the first round (US$9.0 million compared with US$9.8 million in the first round), the second round was generally considered a success. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/16/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Brazilian Power Markets: Demand Recovery Gathers Steam but Supply Questions Remain Author: Bailey, Mattos E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/061600_17/la_alt_061600_17_ab.html Summary: Brazil's power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000. February demand was 6.8 percent over February 1999 levels, and March demand grew a further 7.6 percent above the previous year. The industrial sector continued to lead the recovery with year-to-date demand growing 9.8 percent over 1999, and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7.5 percent over a similar period. As demand growth strengthened, hydro power generation increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in January. Hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by the end of April, signaling the end of the wet season. With rapidly increasing demand, particularly in the South and Southeast regions, Brazil could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several months are delayed. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Mexico after the Elections: The Real Battle Begins Author: Puyana E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/db/062000_12/la_db_062000_12_ab.html Summary: For the first time in many decades, the presidential and parliamentary campaigns are highly competitive, and the results of these democratically conducted elections will have a large impact on the effectiveness and future of the new administration. However, the real political battle begins after the elections. Indeed, the winning party will have to exercise all its political skills to create coalitions and advance negotiations in order to take control of the government. Three different scenarios are portrayed in this CERA Decision Brief. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/26/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Colombia: Weary of War, Wary of Peace Author: Puyana, Scott E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/db/062600_10/la_db_062600_10_ab.html Summary: July 2000 marks the second anniversary of the widely publicized visit of then President-elect Andres Pastrana to elderly guerilla chief of the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC), Manuel Marulanda. Two years later, the country is no closer to peace, and resolution of the ongoing negotiations is uncertain at best. This prolongation and stagnation of the peace process has had a direct negative impact on energy sector investment in Colombia. The government will likely proceed with formal negotiations, but time--and Pastrana's remaining term in office--is running out. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/30/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Argentine Power Markets: Winter Constraints Push Prices Higher in May Author: Bailey E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Latin American Energy URL: http://www.cera.com/client/la/alt/063000_16/la_alt_063000_16_ab.html Summary: Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing to the combination of continued low hydro output, strong demand growth, and periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos Aires region. Spot power prices (energy component only) averaged $18.24 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in May. Although average power prices declined from last year, price volatility increased, with several short-duration episodes of prices over $60 per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region forced several midcost units offline during peak hours. In June, prices are expected to continue strengthening to the $24-$28 per MWh range on average. Beyond June, price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing hydro output, new and returning low-cost thermal capacity, and the end of gas constraints push average prices back toward $15 per MWh or below by August or September. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/01/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: US Gas Markets Reach New Heights: Where Will It Stop? Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/060100_15/nag_alt_060100_15_ab.html Summary: The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as $4.50 per MMBtu--up from less than $3.00 per MMBtu during April. Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply, the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation. The gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories, with injections so far this spring running between 1.5 and 2.0 Bcf per day below last year's rate. The continued tension between these two forces will keep the pressure on prices this summer, and the need to inject gas into storage will price out increments of demand. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/alt/061500_16/nag_alt_061500_16_ab.html Summary: Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three factors--the increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound--call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. Prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years. In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer--with pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise--with the result that gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use demand. CERA expects a July average price of $4.45 per MMBtu. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Western Canada Supply Growth: Getting Nowhere Faster Author: Eynon, Small E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/db/061500_18/nag_db_061500_18_ab.html Summary: As US supply declines and demand grows, current high gas prices are reinforced, but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering when it is needed most. Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie the disappointing production growth results. The largely weather-related transitory factors have had a near-term impact on drilling and connection activity. The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time. More shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well production rates. Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace production. With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling, higher supply growth rates are possible, but if that does not occur, other potential supply sources may step in. Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight. Coal bed methane has become a str! ong source of US supply. Although now ignored in Canada, it may become a future source of Canadian gas. ********************************************************************** CERA Watch : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Reaching New Heights Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Watch Product Line: North American Gas URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/wch/061600_11/nag_wch_061600_11_ab.html Summary: Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the development of spot markets. ********************************************************************** CERA Private Report : 06/21/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Closing the Utility Stock Valuation Gap: Does Strategy Matter? Author: Parshley E-Mail Category: Private Report Product Line: North American Power URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/pr/062000_14/nap_pr_062000_14_ab.html Summary: The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility industry. Traditionally undervalued in the market, the sector is trading at a historically wide 50 percent discount to Standard and Poor's S&P 500. The S&P Utility Index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent, with huge gains by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 electric utilities. Yet early this year, the SPU outpaced all other industry groups. How should constantly evolving utilities in this wide-open sector form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success? The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999--a record $50 billion--was double the 1998 value. But are these choices ahead of the curve? And when will the market catch up? Three groups of new companies with distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape: multiservice and technology providers, superregionals, and global power and ! energy companies. Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating responses to these challenges. ********************************************************************** CERA Decision Brief : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Summer 2000 Spot Electricity Markets Outlook: Divergent Trends in Price Volatility Author: Makovich, Sannicandro E-Mail Category: Decision Brief Product Line: North American Power URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/db/062200_18/nap_db_062200_18_ab.html Summary: While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price spikes this summer, other markets are likely to see a reversal in price volatility as supply-demand balances improve dramatically. One way to interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations. Therefore, forward prices for on-peak wholesale power reflect the common expectation that prices will spike as high as--or even higher than--in 1999. A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/02/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Atlantic Basin Gasoline Markets Soar Author: Meyers E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/rp/alt/060200_17/rp_alt_060200_17_ab.html Summary: Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season, spot gasoline-to-crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War. In CERA's view, this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors: very low inventories, tightening gasoline specifications, and legal uncertainty. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/13/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products Line--US Markets Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/061300_18/rp_alt_061300_18_ab.html Summary: The US gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during May. US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline surged to $8.40 per barrel measured against WTI, up $3.58 per barrel over the strong April value of $4.82. Apparent demand for gasoline skyrocketed to 8.64 million barrels per day (mbd) in response to the start of the summer driving season. Despite increases in the reported demand for distillate and jet/kerosene, these markets did not experience the same month-over-month strength in differentials, dropping to $1.58 and $2.58 per barrel versus WTI, respectively. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/20/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products Line--European Markets Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/062000_14/rp_alt_062000_14_ab.html Summary: As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials to Brent and thus lower refinery margins, refiners attempted to prevent this situation from worsening by reducing throughputs. However, very tight markets for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the fall in those products' values. Meanwhile, fuel oil discounts to crude oil widened in May, driving down simple/hydroskimming margins. In recent weeks, the combination of lower primary products inventories and reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to recover. This has pushed margins to above May's averages, although still below April's peaks. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/26/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Recent Actions Signal Progress Toward MTBE Elimination Author: Stackpole E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/rp/alt/062600_16/rp_alt_062600_16_ab.html Summary: The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline (RFG) now faces from the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) use in the US gasoline pool. Additional signposts, including heightened congressional debate over legislation eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE, continue to emerge that point the way toward MTBE-free gasoline in the United States. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/29/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Refined Products: Market Update Author: Refined Products Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Refined Products URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/alt/062900_16/rp_alt_062900_16_ab.html Summary: Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences. In the Atlantic Basin, low gasoline inventories in both the United States and Europe, which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint, continue to dominate the market, and gasoline differentials above crude are at their highest level in over ten years. Although signs are emerging of a possible correction in the North American market in the coming month, the 2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by Atlantic Basin refiners in many years. In contrast, Asia Pacific spot refining margins were weak through most of June, until the recent accident at KPC's Mina al-Ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt Singapore margins. However, with ample unused refining capacity available east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in July, CERA's outlook is for that strength to be of short duration. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/23/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: New Peaks, New Prices Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy URL: http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/ce/alt/062300_17/ce_alt_062300_17_ab.html Summary: In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and steadily rising power prices. CERA expect the West to be the only region in North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. The convergence of higher gas prices, growing power demand, and reduced hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up western power prices. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer ! power loads. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/15/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Oil Market Turmoil: OPEC Seeks a Short-term Fix Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/061500_18/wo_alt_061500_18_ab.html Summary: Driven by strong demand--especially in the recovering Asian economies and the United States--oil prices (both WTI and Brent) have again broken the $30 level--a mark that is of particular significance in this US election year. In turn, the oil market's attention is again fixed on OPEC, as it prepares for its June 21 meeting, but its members are deeply divided over how to respond. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/16/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The State of the Oil Market: Market Supported, Psychology Enhanced, and OPEC Driven Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/061600_19/wo_alt_061600_19_ab.html Summary: The key ingredient in the volatile oil market is the new OPEC--and its successful implementation of a strategy to keep supply one half step behind demand-driving inventories down for crude, with the side effect of lowering stocks for several products in markets such as the United States and Europe. Three features of the current oil market are supporting prices: * Market supported * Psychology enhanced * OPEC driven ********************************************************************** CERA Alert : 06/22/2000 ********************************************************************** Title: OPEC's Cautious New Agreement Author: World Oil Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: World Oil URL: http://www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/062200_16/wo_alt_062200_16_ab.html Summary: OPEC's agreement to raise its production quota beginning July 1 by 708,000 barrels per day to 25.4 million barrels per day is consistent with its strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low levels. The gain in supply is a short-term fix meant to alleviate political pressure for increased production and to push prices below $30 but keep them in a mid- to upper $20s range. **end** Follow URL for HTML Version of this message only.

NEW POWER PLANT ADDED TO PNM SYSTEM PNM, Public Service Company of New Mexico, now has an additional 132 megawatts of electricity available to help meet peak summer demand.  A new gas-fired generating plant, Delta-Person Station, is now fully operational in Albuquerque, PNM announced this week. 
NGPL Recontracts with NIPSCO Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter. Since Kinder Morgan took over NGPL parent KN Energy last year, the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the Midwest, including another deal announced yesterday with Northern Indiana Public Service (NIPSCO). NGPL and NIPSCO signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling 295,100 MMBtu/d of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and Dec. 1, 2001 and continuing through Nov. 30, 2002. They also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling 10.5 Bcf of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001 and continuing through March 31, 2003. NIPSCO, a NiSource subsidiary, is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly 700,000 customers and electricity to 416,000 customers across the northern third of Indiana. ""Virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year,"" said NGPL President Deborah Mcdonald in an interview. ""Basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year. We've been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [NiGas, NIPSCO and Peoples]."" Despite increasing competitive pressure from Northern Border and Alliance Pipeline, the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators. ""In contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the Midcontinent and Louisiana to Chicago, we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core LDCs. Obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with Aquila Energy for 500,000 MMBtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts,"" Mcdonald said. ""We also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power generators. Growth in NGPL will come from natural gas-fired generation. You probably saw our press release about the Ameren contracts for [construction of 1,700 MW of generation along the NGPL system]. In the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3,000 MW of gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 MW next year as well [which would represent up to 900 MMcf/d in gas transportation capacity]. ""Obviously another challenge is going to be [the 1.325 Bcf/d] Alliance Pipeline coming into the market this fall. It's anyone's guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time. I think a lot of that will be coming into Chicago and moving back out on Vector. But we're ready at Hub America to kind of serve as a giant header system [with Texas Eastern as

These higher demand levels provided the year's first example of the power price spikes that can be produced when the West's tight capacity intersects with normal summer load levels, lower-than-normal hydroelectric levels, strong gas prices, and California's immature wholesale power market structure. As power markets reacted in June with unprecedented price strength throughout the region, regulators and the California Independent System Operator (ISO) intervened to dampen markets from a maximum of $750 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to $500 per MWh.* Although some market participants have filed protests at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to raise or eliminate the caps, utilities, legislators, and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market. As western markets move through the critical July-August peak electricity demand period, market participants and regulators alike are wondering if power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in June. CERA expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer weather conditions, barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages. However, normal August weather conditions will push demand levels significantly higher than in June, creating an even tighter supply-demand balance, straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key demand regions adequately. A hot weather event could exhaust both in-state and imported supplies for California. The tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong price response, similar to that in June. This will fuel the unease of regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that are considering restructuring. Even as regulators' continued support of restructured power markets begins to waver, a weather event that forces regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene. CERA's outlook for August power markets is driven by * High peak loads. Under normal weather conditions, West-wide August loads will be on average 1,400 megawatts (MW) higher than last August. The peak load in California is expected to push capacity margins to 6 percent, even after curtailing interruptible load. * Lower hydroelectric output. As the West enters its peak load period, hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly 3,900 average megawatts (aMW) from July to August. Compared with the high, sustained output of last August, hydroelectric output this August, although roughly average on a historical basis, will be roughly 4,900 aMW (20 percent) lower. * High levels of gas-fired generation. Compared with August 1999, higher utilization rates, along with gas prices that have climbed $1.88 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), will increase the incremental cost of energy production by over $20 per MWh. Although CERA expects power prices in August to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness, higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all periods of the day. The extremely tight power supply-demand balance within the West, and within California specifically, has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand for power generation. This high demand level-combined with seasonal storage injection needs in California-has pushed up utilization rates on pipelines into California and pushed Topock differentials over $0.75 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub. Strong demand should continue through August in the West and support premium pricing at Topock. The Rocky Mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed on Topock deliveries. In the Rockies supply is building relative to export pipeline capacity, and market access is becoming a challenge. Weak seasonal demand compounds the problem; the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the Rockies. Generation within the region remains nearly all coal-fired. These regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through September. Moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the Henry Hub. However, summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels. Higher gas prices are likely to resurface. Regional Power Market Drivers August demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional 7 percent, or nearly 5,500 aMW, over average June levels (see Table 1). Peak demand levels should exceed those in June as well, with a coincident peak over the whole Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) of 118,600 MW expected under normal weather conditions in 2000, a 2.7 percent increase over the weather-muted 1999 peak. California alone should experience peak loads that are approximately 3,600 MW higher than peak levels in June. Available generation capacity in the West has been at normal levels for this time of year, although coal-fired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but short-lived outages. The steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove 3,900 aMW from the West resource base when compared with July levels and about 6,800 aMW since June, although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of June. Given hydro operators' economic interest in maximizing on-peak production at the expense of off-peak production, the loss of capacity during the on-peak period will be lower than these levels. August will be a critical month for the heavily import-dependent state of California. While the state will be drawing approximately 7,000 aMW of imports during August to meet demands during peak periods, CERA expects the level of imports to exceed 8,200 MW during peak demand conditions. The Southwest's need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to California, and lower year-over-year hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest will limit exports from that region. Pacific Northwest CERA expects Pacific Northwest demand in August to climb by nearly 1,300 aMW when compared with June levels. The water supply for the Pacific Northwest has declined to 91 percent of normal levels for the Lower Columbia owing to warmer-than-normal weather in June. In addition, normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about 6,000 aMW from the resource base when compared with levels in June (see Table 2). Generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gas-fired generation at high levels. Although less than 4,000 MW of gas-fired generation is currently available in the region, it has been running at high utilization rates. High energy demand in California for Pacific Northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions. As in June, Pacific Northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility CERA expects to occur in California in August. In addition, if hot weather in the Pacific Northwest pressures regional energy reserves, local prices will rise to keep energy in the region, potentially causing prices in the Pacific Northwest to move higher than those to the south. California California is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance. Although hydroelectric output continues to decline, statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly 118 percent of normal. Nevertheless, declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about 730 aMW when compared with hydroelectric production levels in June. Normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about 3,600 aMW over June levels, which were high (see Table 3). California's peak load is expected to exceed 57,000 MW, compared with a peak load in June of approximately 53,500 MW (43,447 MW on the state's ISO system alone, according to its own estimate). Assuming normal plant outage rates, this demand level will necessitate the import of about 8,200 MW of energy to meet the statewide peak. Even after curtailing the approximately 2,800 MW of interruptible load available for tight supply situations, the state has a precarious 6 percent capacity margin during the system peak. An extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional 3,000 MW. Outages are likely if additional imports are not available. A capacity limit of 4,600 MW will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the Pacific Northwest to Northern California. The import limit from the Pacific Northwest to southern California will be 3,100 MW. Rockies and Southwest August demand levels in the combined Rockies/Southwest region will increase only slightly above levels in August 1999, climbing approximately 275 aMW, as loads in the region-unlike the rest of the below-average WSCC-were near normal last August. Even so, August loads will increase demand by over 1,250 aMW when compared with levels in June of this year. As with last year and this June, supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather, although growing loads in the Rockies/Southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditions. High loads driven by hot weather will keep the region's prices high. Differentials between the region and California will be tight, but California, having tighter supply-demand balances, will need to price at a premium to attract energy. The high-capacity transmission ties between the Rockies/Southwest and the California market, which is about 150 percent the size of the Rockies/Southwest market, will ensure that prices in the Rockies/Southwest stay close behind California prices whenever loads are high in California. Regional Gas Market Drivers Evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the West, and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures. Since the Northern Border expansion in late 1998, narrow north-south and east-west differentials across pricing points defined the market. This summer, the continuing supply growth in the Rocky Mountains has widened differentials between the Rockies and the rest of the West. At Topock, increasing gas demand in California and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiums. Overall in North American gas markets, strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices-from an early July Henry Hub price of $4.50 per MMBtu to under $4.00 per MMBtu. However, despite these high injection rates, the supply-demand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious. Summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices. The ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average Henry Hub price of $4.20 per MMBtu in August. Through the end of the summer, differentials in the West should hold near current levels. The pressure of growing Rocky Mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall. In California high seasonal power loads should continue through August with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation. Demand strength is expected to continue. Across the West, August demand for gas should climb from 9.8 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day in June to 10.4 Bcf per day, buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation (see Table 4). California High gas demand for power generation within California will continue through August. CERA expects an increase from the state's June demand levels of 5.6 Bcf per day to 6.2 Bcf per day during August. The increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads. Total demand is expected to exceed last year's demand level by 1.2 Bcf per day. This will increase flows on pipelines into California, reduce the state's storage surplus, and sustain high prices. CERA expects pipeline utilization rates during August to average 95 percent (see Table 5). CERA expects an August Topock-Henry Hub differential of $0.45 per MMBtu (see Table 6). Pacific Northwest Despite the extremely high prices at Topock and high demand in California, until recently gas at Malin priced at a slight discount to Henry Hub prices. After averaging $0.17 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during the third quarter last year, the differential so far during the third quarter this year is $0.15 per MMBtu below the Hub. This week Malin is pricing at a $0.25 per MMBtu premium relative to the Henry Hub. The Topock-Malin differential has swelled to over $0.60 per MMBtu, signaling intra-California pipeline capacity constraints. Two factors pressured Malin differentials during the early summer. * Pressure on Rocky Mountain and AECO differentials. Prices in the two areas supplying the Pacific Northwest are under some pressure. Increasing supplies in the Rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on Rockies prices by limiting external market access. At AECO, although export capacity out of the province is available, almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern Canada on TransCanada Pipeline. Pipelines into the United States are running near capacity. Because of TransCanada's limited ability to discount interruptible transport, the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled. * Low early summer regional demand. Gas demand in the Pacific Northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output. Even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year, seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in May and June even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in California. Increasing power loads are already evident. The first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the Rockies and western Canada begins climbing. However, gas demand for power generation in the Pacific Northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of July and into August as hydroelectric generation wanes. This added demand-200 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day above June demand levels-will provide some support for Malin prices and limited support for Rockies and AECO prices. Malin-Henry Hub differentials are expected to average $0.05 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price during August. Rocky Mountains Pressure on regional supplies within the Rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs. Differentials to the Henry Hub have widened to over $0.70 per MMBtu and although prices in the rest of the West will gain some support from high power loads, regional demand in the Rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through August. August demand is expected to average 1.2 Bcf per day in the region, approximately equal to June's 1.1 Bcf per day total demand. Demand begins to build during September, but until the heating season begins in October, Rocky Mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the West. CERA expects a Rocky Mountain-Henry Hub differential of $0.60 per MMBtu during August. Although some narrowing in Rocky Mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall, the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during 2001. CERA expects a supply build this year of nearly 300 MMcf per day, followed by a build of over 350 MMcf per day during 2001. Currently, approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region, with the largest increment on Transcolorado into the San Juan Basin. Next summer, all capacity will likely run close to full. Until export pipelines expand-the first likely expansion is Trailblazer-differentials will remain wide. For 2001, CERA expects an average annual differential below the Henry Hub of $0.65 per MMBtu. Southwest Differentials in the San Juan and Permian Basins have gained considerable strength relative to Henry Hub prices amid the recent hot weather in Texas. Permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price, and in the San Juan Basin prices have narrowed from an early July differential of $0.35 per MMBtu to a differential of less than $0.20 per MMBtu. CERA expects demand in the Southwest during August of 1.4 Bcf per day, an increase from June's level of 1.3 Bcf per day, but the larger Texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins. CERA expects a San Juan differential of $0.30 per MMBtu during August, with a Permian Basin differential of $0.06 per MMBtu. Differentials between the Rocky Mountains and the San Juan Basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the Rocky Mountains. Flows on Transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under 20 MMcf per day to over 100 MMcf per day during June. Supply in the two regions is following opposite paths; Rockies supply is climbing rapidly, and San Juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year. CERA expects a decline in supply of 30 MMcf per day during 2000 relative to 1999 and an additional decline of 150 MMcf per day during 2001. Because of these different outlooks, wider Rockies-San Juan differentials will persist. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables.

News Briefs: Reliant Energy Plans to Form Two Public Companies Reliant Energy said it plans to file with the Texas Public Utility Commission a business separation plan under which it would divide into two publicly traded companies to separate its unregulated businesses from its regulated businesses. The company plans an initial public offering of approximately 20% of the common stock of its unregulated operations late this year or early in 2001, assuming market conditions remain favorable. The company expects the IPO to be followed by a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the unregulated company within 12 months. The remaining businesses, which are predominately regulated, will be structured as a holding company. The unregulated company will own Reliant Energy's unregulated power generation and related energy trading and marketing operations, its unregulated retail businesses, which currently include energy, telecommunications and internet services, and the company's European electric generating and trading/marketing operations. The plan also contemplates that in 2004 the unregulated company will receive from the regulated company cash equal to the market value of the regulated company's interest in its Texas regulated generation operations. In addition, the unregulated company will have an option to purchase the regulated company's interest in these operations at a price equal to the market value. The regulated company will include Reliant Energy's electricity and natural gas companies, which serve about four million customers in the U.S. and include Reliant Energy HL&P/Entex, Reliant Energy Arkla, Reliant Energy Entex and Reliant Energy Minnegasco. Other operations in the entity will include its U.S. interstate pipelines, its interests in Latin America and, initially, its Texas regulated generation. 
FERC Approves Questar Pipeline The FERC has given final approval for a Questar $155 million pipeline project to transport natural gas to southern California from the Four Corners area at the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. The ruling came after the commission was satisfied the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline project would not harm the environment. The project will consist of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline that was bought by Questar in 1998 from Arco. The pipeline will be converted for natural gas and several new compressors will be built. The pipeline would be divided into a East Zone and a West Zone. The East Zone will begin in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and end at the California border and carry up to 88 MMcf per day. The West Zone is within California and has a capacity of 120 MMcf per 
FPL Acquires Entergy FPL Group will acquire Entergy for about $6.4 billion in stock in a deal that will create the largest US power company. The news sent FPLs shares lower because of disappointment that FPL was not the takeover target. The combined company will have 6.3 million customers and 48,000 MW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electric service to about 3.8 million customers throughout Florida. Entergy delivers electricity to about 2.5 million customers in parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The deal, a $27 billion merger, which included their combined market value of $16.4 billion, $6.9 billion of Entergy debt and $3.8 billion of FPL debt. FPL shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Entergys 43%. The board of directors will be made up of 8 FPL members and 7 Entergy members. To support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back a total of $1 billion in stock, $570 million in FPL stock and $430 million in Entergy stock. FPL shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of FPLs 170.5 million diluted shares outstanding. Entergy shareholders would receive 0.585 share in the new company for each of their 228.1 million diluted shares outstanding. Shares of FPL fell more than 8%, to 48-1/4 and Entergy shares fell more than 10% to 27-1/4 yesterday afternoon. Based on FPLs price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at about $28.33 per share. Many had speculated FPL was to be bought rather than be involved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $200 million break-up fee in case either side terminates the deal. The merger of FPL and Entergy must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal regulators and was expected to close next year. The combined company expects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPLs current dividend policy. Based on its current annual dividend of $2.16 per share, Entergys shareholders would receive $1.26 per share compared with its current dividend of $1.20 per share. FPLs Broadhead will become the chairman and Entergy Chief Executive Leonard will become chief executive of the new company. The expected annual cost savings and increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businesses may range from $150 million to $275 million, with about half the cost savings to come from work force reductions, mainly through attrition, 
Due to a compressor failure at its Riner Station, Williams declared a force majeure situation on Line Segments 490 and 491. Necessary repairs are expected to be completed by next Monday's gas day. Since capacity in the two segments has been reduced, maintenance originally scheduled for the week of Aug. 21 at the Cheyenne and Ogallah Stations will be done this week to minimize 
Kern River Open Season Kern River is holding an open season through Aug. 18 to determine interest in year-round FT to Nevada and California and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm shippers. The pipeline said it can offer significantly reduced FT rates based on recent FERC approval of Kern River's Extended Term Rate Program (ET Program). Under ET Program, customers could receive a rate reduction from $0.64/Dth to approximately $0.42 under a 15-year contract. Because system expansion can be accomplished by the addition of compression facilities, it could result in an overall lowering of rolled-in rates for all shippers, Kern River said. Depending on open season results, the pipeline is proposing a mainline expansion of up to 500 MMcf/d with an in-service target date of May 1, 2002. If goals can be met using relinquished capacity and no new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as Oct. 1, 2001. Call Laurie Brown at (801) 584-6410 or Greg Snow at -7270 for more information. Panda Links to Transmission Grid for Gila Bend Plant Panda Energy International inked a firm electrical transmission agreement with Arizona Public Service to supply power from its proposed natural gas-fired 2,000 MW plant to be located in the town of Gila Bend. The proposed plant is before the Arizona Corporation Committee for review. Senior vice president of merchant plant development for Panda, Garry Hubbard, said that the firm contract is ""a critical step forward for the plant."" The new plant is on schedule to commence construction later this year, with start up 18 months later, he added. Powering the plant will be eight General Electric 7 FA natural gas turbines operating in combined

FERC Gives High Sign to WI Pipe Competition The northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin gas transportation markets, which long have been dominated by ANR Pipeline, moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline-on-pipeline competition yesterday when FERC awarded the proposed Guardian Pipeline LLC a favorable preliminary determination on non-environmental issues. The decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline because not only did it shoot down most of the arguments presented by ANR to thwart the project, but it found that even though the project would ""adversely 
InterGen Takes 30% Stake in Coral Energy With plans to grow its power generation portfolio in the United States, InterGen, the power generation joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings Inc., closed a deal yesterday giving the international developer a 30% equity interest in Houston-based Coral Energy, one of the largest natural gas and power marketers in the country. Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction giant Bechtel would fold InterGen, InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business (see Daily GPI, July 10). Under the agreement announced yesterday, InterGen will receive the majority of the natural gas pipeline, storage and power generation assets of Shell's Coral Energy affiliate in the United States. It remains a joint venture of Shell and Bechtel. The move gives Shell a 68% ownership in InterGen, with Bechtel owning the remaining 32%. InterGen had been formed as a 50/50 joint venture, and Bechtel made an undisclosed payment to Shell in the deal. About 230 Coral employees, mostly related to the Texas-based assets in Houston, will become InterGen employees under the agreement. InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development, with projects around the world. Carlos Riva, InterGen's CEO, said that the transaction ""represents a significant boost to our plans in the United States. These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier U.S. gas and electricity trading enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the U.S. 
Nymex Moves Gas Opening Bell Up to 9:30 a.m. The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange has amended plans to move up the start-up time for natural gas futures trading because of the overlap with crude oil markets, which share an options ring with natural gas. Daily gas futures trading now will commence at 9:30 a.m. rather than 9:45. The board has scheduled expanded energy trading hours to begin with the Sept. 8 trading session. On July 13, the board voted to expand futures trading hours electronically for its light sweet crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas futures and options markets. It also voted to have an earlier opening for the open outcry session for natural gas futures and options. Beginning at 4 p.m. on Sept. 7 the Nymex Access electronic trading sessions for those commodities will be extended to run from 4 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, to 9 a.m. the following day. On Sundays, the session will begin at 7 p.m. and will run until 9 a.m. on Monday. Currently, the sessions for light sweet crude oil, heating oil and gasoline begin at the same times but close at 8 a.m. Natural gas futures and options currently are traded from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays with 
A hydrostatic test of Line 3201 identified some pipe that must be replaced, El Paso said Thursday, and once that is done the test must be performed again. It estimated the project will extend through Sunday, reducing Bondad Mainline capacity by 180 MMcf/d (normal capacity is 675 MMcf/d) and affecting seven receipt points. With Line 3201 out of service, the 180 MMcf/d loss can not be made up at points downstream of Bondad Mainline, El Paso said. Thus the same (not additional) 180 MMcf/d reduction must be applied at Gallup (NM) Station. PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest said its Internet-based nomination system became operational again Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening power failure caused the server to crash. El Paso will hold meetings Aug. 9 in Houston, Aug. 10 in Los Angeles and Aug. 11 in Phoenix to present details of its Line No. 2000 Project. The project requires FERC approval to abandon certain mainline compressor facilities and replace them with a 30-inch crude oil pipeline upon its conversion to natural gas service. El Paso announced early this year (see Daily GPI, Feb. 4) it was buying part of the All American Pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. and would invest $75 million to convert the segment to a natural gas pipeline. The segment being converted extends 1,088 miles from Emidio, CA, to McCamey, TX. Those planning to attend one of next week's meetings should call Lisa Holmes at 
New Hurricane Forecast out of CSU Renowned hurricane soothsayer Dr. William Gray and his team at Colorado State University have scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the season to be more active than average. Seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three of them are expected to be intense rather than the four expected in the group's prior forecast on June 7. In round numbers, the August forecast is for three named storms, two hurricanes, and one intense or major hurricane. ""Information obtained through July 2000 indicates that the Atlantic hurricane season in 2000 is likely to be less active than the four recent very busy years of 1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999. However, total activity is expected to exceed the long term average and is anticipated to be considerably more active than the mean for the recent period of 1970 through 1994. ""We estimate that the 2000 season will have seven hurricanes (average is 5.7), 11 named storms (average is 9.3), 55 named storm days (average is 47), 30 hurricane days (average is 24), three intense (category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.2), six intense hurricane days (average is 4.7) and a Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) of 90 (average is 71). Collectively, net tropical cyclone activity in year 2000 is expected to be about 130% of the long term average. The early August forecast update is in close to Gray's Dec. 8, 1999) and April 7 forecasts, but somewhat lower than his recent June 7 update. ""The forecast has been lowered slightly [because] June-July global circulation conditions have not progressed quite as favorably for hurricane

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Tue, August 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing: In a High Range Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1314 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/081500_17/nag_alt_081500_17_ab.html ********************************************************************** Gas prices remain within a high range, with prices volatile between approximately $3.75 and $4.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). Prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall, until the uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself. At the lower end of this range--and with oil prices in the upper $20s per barrel or higher--price support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to reactivate industrial demand. Gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions, allowing storage injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter. Above-normal heat in only one or two regions, however, or even the threat of storms in the Gulf of Mexico will pull prices quickly upward. As for the upper boundary, although prices in specific regions such as California and the Northeast may reach above $5.00, an actual storm in the Gulf or more widespread heat than! has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the Henry Hub much above $4.50. Absent tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico, CERA expects prices to settle into the lower portion of this band during September (see Table 1). Although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely to sustain prices through much of August, the seasonal decline in generation demand into September should allow storage injections to increase by 1.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. As a result, CERA expects prices to settle somewhat, averaging $3.95 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub during September. However, the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged: supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter. Any interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward; next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year. Gas Storage--Not Yet Enough Mild weather over much of the United States during July allowed a much-needed recovery in storage injections, with the estimated injection rate increasing by nearly 2.5 Bcf per day from year-earlier levels (see Table 2). This rate was enabled entirely by lower demand, however, and not added supply. The result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during August, the US storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near 350 Bcf. Although the deficit is likely to decline on average during August, it is even more likely to expand again during September, especially should any storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms. Absolute inventories and supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market. Inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from occurring next spring. Should injections continue as expected, inventories would reach approximately 2,750 Bcf by October 31; but reaching even this level, still an all-time low annual maximum inventory, requires some help from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in October. Storage inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season. Regional Markets--Western Disconnects Continue Wide differentials emerged this summer in the West and look likely to persist through September. In Southern California record summer demand levels have pushed pipeline flows to new highs. Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America. In the Rockies supply growth has pushed up pipeline flows out of the region. Power loads should ease somewhat in Southern California, and that easing will bring some decline in the Topock premium. Pressure on Rocky Mountains and San Juan prices should persist until the start of the heating season in late October (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: *  Rockies. Pipeline capacity out of the Rockies is running nearly full to every export market except the San Juan Basin. Emerging pipeline bottlenecks should keep differentials wide during September, with an average differential of $0.75 per MMBtu. *  San Juan. In the San Juan increased imports from the Rocky Mountains and high utilization rates on capacity into California are pressuring prices. CERA expects differentials to average $0.55 per MMBtu for the month of September. San Juan differentials will narrow more substantially when Rocky Mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand during the fourth quarter. *  Permian and Mid-Continent. Strong power loads in Texas have supported Permian Basin prices during July and August. Persistent power demand is expected to keep differentials around $0.08 per MMBtu for September. Mid-Continent prices should average just under Permian prices. *  Chicago. Steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at Chicago in the face of declining power generation into September. July premiums of $0.06 to $0.07 have already come down in early August and are likely to remain low, at approximately $0.03 for September. *  Northeast markets. Northeast price premiums have averaged from the mid-$0.20s to the mid-$0.30s, depending on generation load and proximity to the New York Facilities Group major meters. CERA expects little to change this relationship, but as generation loads decline into September, premiums could move closer to the fuel cost floor, the mid- to high $0.20s. Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Disappointing Although June displayed year-over-year growth in production in western Canada, July reverted to a decline, and August is running close to last year's level. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in 2000, approximately 9,200 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is expected to produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western Canadian supply build is expected to be flat with 1999, increasing to a positive growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are down 275 MMcf per day on average for 2000 but have been down by over 350 MMcf per day so far in the third quarter. PG&E GT-NW volumes were up by over 300 MMcf per day in June and July but have dropped to year-earlier levels in August and are expected to remain close to last year's levels for September. Northern Border Pipeline is operating at rates similar to last year's on average in 2000 but is expected to decrease about 50 MMcf per day for the third quarter. Western Canadian demand is currently up slightly, driven by the warmer-than-normal weather in late July and early August, but should be closer to 1999 levels in September. High Prices: Wide Differentials The AECO-Henry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few months from the low US$0.30s of the first quarter to US$0.84 in July. The differential increased to well over a dollar in the second week of August, but the driver for that increase was maintenance that reduced the export capacity at Empress. August and September are expected to average in the mid-$0.80s. AECO is expected to average C$4.67 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.35 per MMBtu) for August, with September softening to C$4.53 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu) for a third quarter average of C$4.54 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables. ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

New Xcel Energy Combination Completed Just 17 months after announcement of merger plans, Minneapolis-based Northern States Power and Denver-based New Century Energies have cleared the last hurdle to combine under the new name Xcel Energy Inc. The merger creates one of the 10 largest electricity and natural gas companies in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued its approval of the merger, wrapping up approvals from several federal agencies and states where the companies operate. Xcel Energy will serve more than 3 million electricity and 1.5 million natural gas customers in 12 states, and 2 million electricity customers internationally. Company headquarters will be in Minneapolis. Gradually, the NSP and NCE names will be phased out as Xcel Energy provides enhanced products and services in 12 states, including parts of Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, under the symbol XEL. Current New Century Energies shareholders will receive 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy stock for each share of NCE they hold. NSP shareholders will get one for one and will not be required to exchange their existing NSP stock. The merger proposal was announced March 25, 1999, and completed in less than a year and a half. ""This has been an incredibly successful merger process,"" said Jim Howard, Xcel chairman. ""It demonstrates what can be accomplished when regulators, environmentalists, community leaders and the merger partners all work in a common direction --- to create a better utility company for the 
Note:  The following 3 articles deal with 3 different issues: 1st -- Marketing related 2nd - Operations/marketing related 3rd - Legislative/regulatory related El Paso Explosion Takes 500 MMcf/d Off Market About 1 Bcf/d of flow on El Paso's South Mainline downstream of Pecos River (NM) Station ceased after the pipeline exploded early Saturday, killing 10 people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite. El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers, maximum storage withdrawals, an OFO and other customer cooperation. The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points rose by about 35 cents to lead an overall price surge. However, utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems. SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems. A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power also saw no reason for panic. From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines, he expected that the approximately 80-feet-long section missing from El Paso's line could be ""slapped back into place rather 
Note:  This text was released today by Natural Gas Intelligence after an interview with Alliance personnel Construction Completed on Alliance Pipeline The C$4.6 billion Alliance natural gas and liquids pipeline, designed to transport 1.325 Bcf/d from northeast British Columbia to Chicago, has completed its construction phase and now is commissioning the main line, laterals, compressors and supervisory equipment. The final weld was completed last week near Regina, SK, and Alliance now is injecting linepack. The 1,857 mile mainline is stretched to the Chicago area from northeastern BC. October is still the target month to begin service of the pipeline, which will carry both natural gas and liquids. The pipeline system will transport natural gas through a 36-inch diameter high-pressure line. There will be 14 mainline compressor stations: seven in Canada and seven in the U.S. When it began construction in 1999, Alliance already had commitments from 37 shippers for 15-year contracts worth a total of $8.2 billion. The large volumes of gas Alliance will haul from western Canada into the U.S. Midwest is expected to have a major impact on existing pipelines, markets and prices. TransCanada PipeLines already has filed for new tolls to compensate for customers which have failed to renew firm contracts on its line and instead are routing their gas through Alliance. New gas that makes its way into the Chicago area could be sent on to southern Ontario through the Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline, scheduled to open in late October with intial capacity of 720 Bcf/d.  The Foothills/Northern Border route from western Canada into the Midwest also is expected to see some slack. Alliance spokesman Jay Godfrey said last month that ""when October comes we won't be in the position that we'll have to start filling the pipe. It essentially already is going to be full."" Connections to 37 gas plants are already complete. Investors in Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnerships include affiliates of Coastal (14.4%), Enbridge (21.4%), Fort Chicago Energy Partners LP (26%), Williams (14.6%) and Westcoast Energy (23.6%).

September Forecast 
Alert ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Tue, August 22, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing: A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices Author: Zenker, Snyder, Moritzburke E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1320 , Alternate URL: http://www.cera.com/client/ce/alt/082200_18/ce_alt_082200_18_ab.html ********************************************************************** As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices for both power and natural gas, September looms as the start of the fall shoulder season. The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels. CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past, however, with power and gas markets producing strong year-over-year prices and little relief from summer levels, even with normal September weather. West-wide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June, a month with high power prices. In addition, compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows, leaving more expensive gas-fired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output. CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push on-peak prices in the West to 244 percent over September 1999 levels. Continued strong use of gas-fired generation in the West, as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances, will keep the pressure on gas prices. Topock prices are expected to average $4.45 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in September. These high September gas and power prices are driven by * Declining hydroelectric output. The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West, with rainfall historically boosting output in December. Approximately 16,400 average megawatts (aMW) will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the three-month period. This represents a net reduction in capacity of 6,900 aMW when compared with the recent June-August summer months and a reduction of 3,600 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels. * Higher, more variable power demand. The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September, and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a year's peak load event will occur in September. Spiking loads, however, can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather. Thus, power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September. * High levels of gas-fired generation. Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gas-fired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June 2000, a month with similar average demand and monthly average on-peak power prices in the $150-$178 per megawatt-hour (MWh) range, depending on the region. This strong pull on gas-fired plants will push deep into the generation resource base, driving prices upward. An additional 1.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day will be required for gas-fired generators in the US West compared with September 1999 levels. * Strong North American gas prices. Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summer's peak levels, as North American supplies remain tight. A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall. As a result, average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around $3.95 per MMBtu. An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the $4.50 mark. * Strong western basis differentials. The strong demand for gas to serve gas-fired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels, especially in the California markets. CERA expects a Topock-to-Henry Hub differential of $0.40 per MMBtu during September. Extended operational problems associated with El Paso's pipeline rupture would raise that outlook. Regional Power Market Drivers Hotter-than-normal August weather, transmission and generator outages, high natural gas prices, and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August. Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of $90 per MWh during the on-peak period and by $14 per MWh during the off-peak period. Mid-Columbia power prices, bearing the brunt of fire-induced transmission outages, experienced a jump from July price levels of $114 per MWh for the on-peak period and $20 per MWh in the off-peak period. Off-peak prices, which have averaged above $60 per MWh during the June-August period, are clearly defined by the production cost of gas-fired resources. On-peak prices during this same period, at over $100 per MWh in all regions in all months, have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator (see Table 1). A return to normal weather should drive West-wide loads down by 8,300 aMW in September from August levels. However, load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by 5,400 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels. These greater loads, coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of 3,600 aMW from last September's levels, will create supply tightness during September (see Tables 2 and 3). Hydroelectric, coal, and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve West-wide demand in September, even during much of the off-peak periods, requiring gas-fired resources to meet a significant portion of the load. Gas demand for power generation is expected to average 5.2 Bcf per day in September, down from over 5.9 Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic 1.7 Bcf per day compared with levels in September 1999. September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gas-fired generation, approximately $50 per MWh, with prices frequently higher as demand increases. As this summer has clearly demonstrated, prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight. Hot weather-induced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship. * Cooler- or hotter-than-normal weather in September, coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads, will produce a wide range of price outcomes. Under normal weather, on-peak power prices are expected to fall in the $113-$123 per MWh range, depending on location, representing a 244 percent premium to year-ago September prices (see Figure 1). The latest revision of the California Independent System Operator's (ISO's) imbalance energy market cap down to $250 per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September. CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well. Pacific Northwest Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least 1,100 aMW compared with those in the hotter-than-normal month of August, the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to 1,900 aMW over the same period (see Table 4). Thus, the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions. With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period, power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California. These price levels will continue to support the operation of the region's limited quantity of gas-fired generation. Mid-Columbia on-peak price levels are expected to average $118 per MWh in September. Off-peak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south. The expected September level of $54 per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets. California The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path 15 and those to the south. As in years past, hydro-depleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region. Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle, and energy from the nuclear and coal-rich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path 15 import limitations. This condition, which is expected to persist from September through November, allows Northern California to price at a premium. The expected monthly average on-peak Northern California price of $123 per MWh incorporates this dynamic. Notably, the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California, in part to capture locational price differences more effectively. Southern California, like the Southwest, will typically experience hot weather episodes in September. During these high demand periods, prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer. In addition, California as a whole should see average loads in September that are 4,600 aMW higher than those of September 1999. Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices. Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region, allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California. An $8 per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected, with Southern California on-peak prices averaging $115 per MWh. Off-peak prices of $53 and $47 per MWh for Northern and Southern California, respectively, reflect the continued need for gas-fired resources to support September off-peak loads. Rockies and Southwest An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies, a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning. Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West. A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North. Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads, with a September monthly on-peak price average of $113 per MWh and an off-peak price average of $43 per MWh. CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis. The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns, and a strong 7,600 MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other. Strong gas prices and occasional market tightness-induced price run-ups will maintain on-peak prices at the $115 per MWh level in September. Off-peak prices will, like those in Southern California, be buoyed by the high cost of gas-fired generation. A price level of $47 per MWh is expected for off-peak prices. Regional Gas Market Drivers The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America, with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition. Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States, the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile. The storage deficit now stands at approximately 350 Bcf, and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels. This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September. CERA expects a Henry Hub price of $3.95 per MMBtu during September. In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September, especially in California. Overall, total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from 10.1 Bcf per day during August to 9.8 Bcf per day during September (see Table 5). This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month. The recent price disconnects between the supply-rich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demand-charged California will persist. October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase. In general, winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West. The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads. Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan. On the other hand, healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season. The start-up of the new Alliance pipeline, which will draw gas to the Midwest, will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California. California Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America, although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near $1.00 per MMBtu before this weekend's pipeline explosion. Total imports into California reached record levels during July; total imports of 5.8 Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day (see Table 6). Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at 83 percent utilization. So far in August, pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate, running at 85 percent. These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California, and the pressure should continue during September. Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September, but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support. Total demand in the state should average 6.6 Bcf per day, down only slightly from August's total of 6.8 Bcf per day. Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly, but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand. The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately $0.50 per MMBtu for September (see Table 7). Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States, but the storage surplus in the region has eroded. In California, inventories are running lower than last year, and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September. The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes. Pacific Northwest Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown. So far this month, prices at Malin are averaging a $0.25 per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub. Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full; flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly 2.2 Bcf per day this month. Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity, and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide Malin-to-Topock differentials. Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong, and the wide north-south differentials within the West will likely hold through September. In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to 1.5 Bcf per day from 1.4 Bcf per day in August. This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels. For September CERA expects Malin prices to average $0.10 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand. Although the westward pull on supplies is strong, bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices. Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached 93 percent during July, with less than 200 MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity. Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply, and in general, the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin. Unlike in the past two summers, the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices. The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged $0.50 per MMBtu so far this month and $0.30 per MMBtu since June. Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by 200 MMcf per day relative to last summer, but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect. Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand, the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September. The San Juan-to-Henry Hub differential is expected to average $0.60 per MMBtu. As in the Rockies, differentials should narrow substantially in October. Rocky Mountains Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb. Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region; generation is still largely coal-based, and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal. CERA expects the heavy discount-current Rocky Mountain-to-Henry Hub differentials are around $0.90 per MMBtu-to persist through September. Local area demand is not expected to change during September. Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads; October demand should average 1.4 Bcf per day, up from August and September averages of around 1.2 Bcf per day. Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies, winter differentials are expected to stay in the $0.25 to $0.40 per MMBtu range. Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer. Next summer, pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer. Although pipeline expansion projects have been announced-Trailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summer-the new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer. CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by 300 MMcf per day next year. Western Canada After widening to over US$1.50 per MMBtu, the AECO-Henry differential has begun to narrow somewhat; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from $0.84 per MMBtu in July. With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow, differentials are likely to persist in the mid-US$0.70s per MMBtu for September. AECO is expected to be US$3.25 per MMBtu (C$4.53 per gigajoule) for September. Even with the start-up of the Alliance project, the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the two-tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs. This will result in differentials that will range between US$0.60 and US$0.75 per MMBtu throughout the winter. Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last year's levels. The pace of drilling (over 9,000 gas wells are expected this year) should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001. Supply is expected to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Sumas prices have been quite volatile, driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system. For September, Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US$0.05 per MMBtu. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

El Paso South Mainline Shut-in Extended The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) has ordered all three of the pipes comprising El Paso Natural Gas' 1 Bcf/d South Mainline from Texas to California to remain closed until extensive tests can be done to ensure they are safe to operate. The order came in the wake of Saturday's explosion and fire that ripped through one of those lines, the 30-inch pipeline 1103, at a Pecos River crossing near Carlsbad, NM, killing 11 people. Because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of pipeline, OPS is directing El Paso to submit a corrective action plan for OPS approval that will identify all areas on approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may be subject to internal corrosion,"" said Kelley S. Coyner, head of the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for the OPS, in a prepared statement. The DOT ""is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the vicinity of Pecos River remain closed until such time that the department has determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate."" This is necessary to ""protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure 
Aquila Signs Long-Term Deal with APEA Aquila Energy said it has been awarded a $550 million long-term contract to supply 154 Bcf of natural gas over 12 years to members of the American Public Energy Agency (APEA). It is the fourth contract the agency has awarded to Aquila since 1998. ""With the future of gas prices becoming more and more unknown because of increasing demands and tightening supply, our members will benefit greatly from this long-term contract,"" said Roger Mock, president and chief executive officer of APEA. Under the three previous contracts with APEA Aquila is supplying the agency with 14.4 Bcf of gas over ten years, 91 Bcf over 12 years and 141 Bcf over 12 years. All together, Aquila is providing APEA with more than 400 Bcf over the next 12 years. APEA provides a reliable supply of natural gas to many municipal utilities and other public entities throughout the United States. These public buyers serve thousands of homes and businesses. ""Our strategy is to provide our customers with the most effective portfolio of services, both financially and physically, to enhance their competitive position in managing their energy needs,"" said Tom McCarthy, vice president of structured transactions for Aquila Energy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Devon Energy and Santa Fe Snyder completed their $2.5 billion merger yesterday as shareholders of both companies approved the deal, which was announced in May. The agreement called for each Santa Fe Snyder common share to be converted into 0.22 shares of Devon common stock. Conversion requires issuance of 40.6 million additional Devon common shares, resulting in total shares outstanding of 127.7 million. Former Santa Fe Snyder shareholders now own 32% of the combined company. Historical Devon shareholders own 68% of the combined company. The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. With merger completion, Devon now ranks among the top five U.S.-based independent oil and gas producers in terms of market capitalization, total proved reserves and annual production. The company has an enterprise value of $9 billion and proved reserves of 1.1 billion boe. The company expects to realize $30 million to $35 million in annual cost savings from the merger. Devon was added to the S&P 500 Index after the close of

El Paso South System Flows 700 MMcf/d Less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system in southeastern New Mexico, the pipeline last week had more than 700 MMcf/d of its 1.1 Bcf/d capacity restored to its South Mainline that services markets between Texas and California. At mid-day Friday, El Paso said it began running about 260 MMcf/d through Line 1100 after it received the go-ahead from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), according to spokeswoman Kim Wallace. El Paso was able to re-start partial service on the 26-inch line after it built a 16-inch temporary connector line between Line 1110 and Line 1100, which was approved by OPS. The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion site, about 30 miles from Carlsbad, NM. Wallace said Line 1100 would carry the gas from Eunice, NM, just Northeast of the Pecos River Compressor Station, to the connector with Line 1110, which then would transport it westward across the Pecos River Bridge where it would meet up with Line 1100 further downstream. Meanwhile, Wallace said El Paso submitted to OPS last week the test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line 1100. Three days prior, the OPS had given El Paso permission to restore service to Line 1110 from the Keystone Station through the Pecos River Compressor Station at a reduced level. The pipeline re-opened the line at about 400 MMcf/d, and gradually increased it to 480 MMcf/d by Friday. This is ""still within the limits it [OPS] set"" for Line 1110, Wallace said. The OPS restricted El Paso's Line 1110 to 80% of the operating pressure of Line 1103 at the time it ruptured, according to Department of Transportation spokeswoman Debbie Hinz. She said this put the line at a pressure of about 538 pounds per square inch. The OPS-ordered shutdown of Line 1110 lasted 10 days, during which the agency ordered El Paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic, ultrasound and X-ray tests to determine its safety, and to submit a plan for restoring service to the line. As for the future of ruptured Line 1103, Wallace said repairs on it would not begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed, which will 
Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
Texans Bake as Electricity Usage Hits Record By today, a ""cool"" spell was expected to grip Texas, plunging temperatures down to around 100. A nice respite from the 105-plus temperatures that stilled the state and sent electricity peak loads to new records last week for the third time this year. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an industry coalition that administers the state's power grid and serves 85% of the state's electric load, reported Friday that preliminary numbers indicated that electricity usage reached an all-time peak high for the third time in 44 days last Thursday, with Texans using 57,731 MW of power. Of course, that was before the weekend, when temperatures were expected to climb as high as 112 at some locations in the state --- just in time for Labor Day picnics. The new usage record last Thursday broke the previous record set the day before, on Wednesday, when consumers used 55,994 MW of power. The two broken records broke a record set just six weeks earlier, July 19, when Texans used 55,796 MW of power. Peak load in August 1999 was 54,849 MW of power, while peak load in August

Prudential Sees Bull Market Running Two More Years With gas futures prices soaring past $5, now is not a bad time to raise price forecasts and expectations for the coming winter and next year. Prudential Securities did just that yesterday, upping its predictions on spot wellhead prices to $4.10 for the second half of the year, $3.55 for all of 2000 and $3.65 for 2001. ""[W]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a 'lay up,'"" the investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas fundamentals. Below average storage inventories and increasing gas-fired electric generation demand should keep the bull market running, the report stated. Prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 Bcf, or 11% below last year's level. ""This is assuming that the average injection rate is at or above the eight-year historical average during that period, and so far this year refills have been at or below the historical average. Depending on the winter weather, the industry typically consumes 2,000-2,500 Bcf out of storage inventories, which would likely bring storage levels down 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Thu, June 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1230 , Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market, as three factors-increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound-call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. As strong as gas market fundamentals are, gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years.  In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer-with pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise-and gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use demand. The $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) increase in gas prices since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users. First, gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the East Coast, and gas will likely lose approximately 600 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer. Second, several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down. Equally telling, however, is that heat in any one region of the country-most recently the West-is all that is required to sustain gas prices above $4.00 at the Henry Hub, despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets. Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive. For these reasons CERA expects prices to average $4.45 at the Henry Hub during July (see Table 1), and even greater volatility is ! possible. The intense competition and need to price out end-use demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above $5.00 per MMBtu amid heat waves this summer. Gas Storage-Injections Increase, but Little Relief Yet The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages, with the American Gas Association (AGA) reporting 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of injections during each of the weeks ending June 2 and 9. However, these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to 400 Bcf on a year-over-year basis, and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks, or even months, to come. As temperatures rise through the end of the month, injections are likely to slow, so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of approximately 10 Bcf per day. The deficit that stood at an estimated 394 Bcf as of the end of May (see Table 2), on an inventory level of approximately 1,454 Bcf, is expected to rise slightly during June, to 403 Bcf, despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month. With US wellhead supply still running an estimated 0.5 to 1.0 Bcf per day below year-earlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting this decline, even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task. Each month in which this 400 Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October. Injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this pattern to reverse in a significant way, an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions. Regional Markets With the exception of the Rocky Mountains, western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region. This strong demand is pulling supplies from the Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California. Prices at the California border have been particularly strong, averaging over a $0.30 premium to the Henry Hub so far this month. Continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through July, as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines. In addition, the early heat waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus, although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: *  Rockies. Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region. High utilization rates on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer. CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry Hub of $0.55 per MMBtu. *  San Juan. The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub, and this West Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer. CERA expects a differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of $0.16 per MMBtu during July. *  Permian and Mid-Continent. As Texas power loads increase, the competition from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify. Permian differentials, which have been averaging around $0.15 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub, should narrow. CERA expects a $0.06 per MMBtu differential for July. Mid-Continent supplies should price just below Permian supplies, at an $0.08 per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub. *  Chicago. Chicago differentials continue to trade around $0.05 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub, and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials, ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure. CERA expects a July differential of $0.06 per MMBtu. *  Northeast. New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer, namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of $4.00 gas. The result has been differentials above $0.30 from Transco Station 65 but closer to $0.30 from the Henry Hub. As power generation load reaches its peak, however, differentials can rise even in summer. Short-lived power load peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the $0.40s, but for the month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average $0.34. Canadian Markets-Demand Still Down Canadian demand continues to be down on a year-over-year basis. Volumes on TransCanada Pipeline are 400 MMcf below levels at this time last year, and Alberta demand is 200 MMcf below; both of these reductions are primarily storage related. Weak storage injections, driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summer-winter price spread, continue to place inventories further behind 1999 levels. Although inventories are still well above the five-year average, unless injections increase, it is more likely that end-of-season inventories will be comparable to the five-year average (450 Bcf) rather than to 1999 levels (484 Bcf). Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year. Thus far in June, flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to 1999, while PG&E GT-NW is currently operating 300 MMcf higher. Demand on the West Coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer. Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with 1999 levels. An outage pattern similar to last year's has emerged. TCE/NOVA has had maintenance projects ongoing in June, but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds. Thus far in June, reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as 850 MMcf but should average 300 MMcf for the month. Even though June is expected to be flat year-over-year, the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than 1999 maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred. Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year, largely in the fourth quarter, as a result of the increased level of drilling. The annual average supply is expected to be around 100 MMcf per day higher than in 1999 as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and modest growth in British Columbia (again primarily later in the year), as well as the new production from! Ft. Liard that is now onstream. The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada. AECO is expected to average C$5.15 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.69 per MMBtu) for June with a differential in the low US$0.60s. July is expected to average C$5.44 per GJ (US$3.90 per MMBtu). The Henry-to-AECO differential is likely to remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand.

EIA Predicts Supply Shortfall Will Linger Through Winter The Energy Information Administration said yesterday in its September Short-Term Energy Outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead will increase by about 87% this winter (October-March) compared to last winter. Residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27% compared to last year. For the entire year, the average wellhead price for natural gas is projected to be $3.40/Mcf, the highest annual wellhead price on record (in inflation-adjusted terms, it would be the highest annual average price since 1985). The short-term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry's ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are likely to continue into the heating season, EIA said. Storage levels could end up being about 8% below the five-year average of about 3,000 Bcf by the start of winter if net injections continue at 10% below historically average rates through the remainder of the refill season. The effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the form of significantly increased production until after the next heating season, according to the agency's report. ""For now, we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001, with assumed increases of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, for this year and next...,"" the EIA report stated. ""On the other hand, the U.S. natural gas rig count on Aug. 25 was at a recent high of 794 rigs. Exploration and production budgets for many natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001, spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues from producing assets. Also on the positive side, data from the Texas Railroad Commission suggest that, through May, year 2000 gas production increased, if only slightly (0.4%). This signifies a turnaround (however modest) in a key producing region. Very high gas drilling rates, including a record-setting pace in deep offshore Gulf of Mexico, confirm that 
Northern Natural Gas declared a force majeure after discovering a leak in its 20-inch Plymouth to Mitchell line in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. Teams isolated the leak, NNG said Wednesday, and the approximate downtime was expected to be two days. Flow was scheduled to zero at the Shell Tippett, Burlington, Marathon Yates and Southern Union receipt points. El Paso reported raising maximum flow through Pecos River Station, near the site of a pipeline explosion Aug. 19, from 700 MMcf/d to 750 MMcf/d effective on Wednesday's business day. El Paso will continue to evaluate the available throughput level while operating under the federal Department of Transportation's Corrective Action Order on allowable pressures in the Pecos

American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Watch Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1235 , Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the development of spot markets. **end** Follow URL for complete report.

Predictions of Fuel Switching 
High Prices Put a Damper on Industrial Demand Gas producers must be wringing their hands in glee as futures prices top $4.45/MMBtu, but some of their customers clearly are a little less than overjoyed. High gas prices are forcing some fertilizer producers to consider shutting down their plants and selling their feedstock on the open market just to make ends meet. WEFA Inc. energy analyst Ron Denhardt estimates the gas industry will lose 25% (400 MMcf/d) of demand from the ammonia and urea industry this year because of the high price of natural gas. Other observers are expecting much larger losses, reaching as high as 1.5 Bcf/d. Denhardt also estimates the loss of an additional 1-2 Bcf/d due to fuel switching in the power production sector and possibly another 2.2 Bcf/d as industrial end users switch over to fuel oil. But those numbers are dependent on the comparative price of Nos. 1 and 2 fuel oil, both of which currently exceed the price of natural gas per Btu. ""Chemical and fertilizer companies who have hedged their gas supplies are better off shutting down their plants right now and selling the gas into the market,"" said one chemical plant supply manager, who asked to remain anonymous. ""It's terrible. It's awful. About 70% of my contracts for sale are pass-through based on the cost of raw materials, and that's the only thing that is keeping me in business right now. We would not be making cost right now otherwise. We might be at a break-even point. And we hedged about 40% of our purchases back in September of last year, which was a pretty good time, looking back right now. We just have to plan it day by day. A number of fertilizer companies have closed 
El Paso Open Season Was 'Rigged,' CPUC Says Armed with a ""smoking gun"" discovered in just-released data, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has launched a fresh offensive against El Paso Natural Gas' 1.22 Bcf/d transportation contract arrangement with affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. Based on information uncovered in an internal e-mail, the CPUC now contends that the open season last February for one third of El Paso's firm transportation capacity was ""rigged"" to show preference to El Paso Merchant. The e-mail revealed that during the open season El Paso Merchant had ""secretly negotiated"" a two cents/MMBtu transportation discount rate on Mojave Pipeline, another El Paso affiliate, for service from Topock to Southern California Gas at Wheeler Ridge for quantities above 100,000 MMBtu/d effective March 1, 2000, the CPUC told FERC. The interruptible discount would last the entire 15 months of the new contracts offered in El Paso Natural Gas' open season, state regulators said, adding that Mojave had withheld announcing the discount until Feb. 18 --- after El Paso's open season had ended. The discounted capacity on Mojave was critical, given that FERC previously had ruled that about half of the 1.22 Bcf/d El Paso capacity (Block II capacity) could not directly access the SoCal-Topock delivery point. As a way around this restriction, bidders in the El Paso open season knew they could use El Paso capacity to access Mojave Pipeline at Topock, and then have their gas shipped to SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, the CPUC said. But what they didn't know was that Mojave had negotiated a discount with El Paso Merchant, the commission noted. The shippers were operating under the assumption that the IT rate still was four cents/MMBtu, which it had been for the previous 18 months. The information about the discount was disclosed in a Feb. 9 e-mail written by El Paso Merchant Vice President Robin Cox, which acknowledged that ""Mojave is willing to offer"" a two cent/MMBtu discount rate for volumes above 100,000 MMBtu/d. ""I will not officially request this discount until next Wednesday assuming we win the capacity,"" the executive wrote. ""After it is posted, it 
Note:  Alliance announced an October 30 official in-service date for tariff services; however, they will be selling test gas in ramp up period.  Right now, these first deliveries are going into the ANR system because it is the only interconnect that is ready. Alliance Delayed, But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up After months of speculation in the industry, Alliance Pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct. 30. When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago, Oct. 2 was the target date for commercial service. However, the delay doesn't mean the market won't be getting any Canadian gas out of Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling 50-100 MMcf/d of gas into the market. It intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full 1.325 Bcf/d load prior to switching to commercial service on Oct. 30, said spokesman Jack Crawford. ""We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas. Right now I think we are dealing with three or four different marketers. Our initial deliveries right now are into the ANR system. That's because its basically the only connection that is ready, but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all. ""I'd be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases of 100 MMcf/d each week] but that's kind of the game plan,"" said Crawford. ""On Oct. 29 it will be Alliance selling [1.325 Bcf/d of] test gas, and on Oct. 30 it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other. The market may not see much of a difference. We obviously don't want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked 
Locations 
El Paso, Coastal Consolidate Pipeline Staff El Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said. The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II. Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern region headquartered in Birmingham, AL. John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J. Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C. Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James Yardley will report to Somerhalder. ""This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's pipeline system,"" said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. ""Our upcoming merger with Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation, border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and

As things stand, the= =20 market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter= =20 even under normal weather conditions. This prospect has placed a floor on the ga= s price at the price of residual fuel oil, itself priced in the mid- to upper= =20 $4.00s range. Gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market, diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply=20 concerns again. To the upside, there is little demand response to price until=20 industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil, as of this writing near $7.0= 0=20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), is breached. However, distillate=20 markets themselves are extremely tight, and prices for that fuel would likely follo= w=20 gas prices up. Within this range, prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety= =01*the market=01,s judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall, which would b= e characterized by extreme pricing and volatility, and a difficult process of= =20 supply allocation by price. By now, exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain. Althou= gh CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately 2.0 billion cu= bic feet (Bcf) per day from August to September, this increase would still leav= e inventories at record lows for this month and next. Even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms, or if hot weather returns. For October, heating load enters the picture. With US supplies running clos= e=20 to year-earlier levels and imports slightly higher, demand priced out of the= =20 market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from las= t=20 year=01,s low level. As a result, although prices may close the month of September in= =20 the upper $4.00s per MMBtu, at the high end of the competitive range with resid= , any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward=20 during the remainder of September or in October. As the heating season begins, therefore, CERA expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter = to result in the first ever monthly average price of $5.00 at the Henry Hub (s= ee Table 1) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price. Gas Storage=01*New Record Lows CERA estimates that storage inventories in the United States crossed into= =20 record low territory as of the end of August, when inventories of 2,233 Bcf fell= =20 below the previous 1996 record low of 2,245 Bcf (see Table 2). More records will likely be broken in the coming months, and by widening margins. Injections = for September are expected to average 9.5 Bcf per day, an increase of 2.0 Bcf p= er day from the August level but below last year=01,s pace of 10.3 Bcf per day= . CERA=01,s September estimate could be exceeded under mild weather condition= s with no tropical activity hitting the Gulf of Mexico, but injections would= =20 likely fall below the 9.5 Bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation = of platforms. This rate would leave US inventories at 2,518 Bcf at month=01,s = end, a record low by 87 Bcf. For October, CERA expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last= =20 year. Injections of 5.5 Bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema= nd priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropica= l storm activity. October injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf pe= r=20 day (1989) to 8.5 Bcf per day (1998). Even if injections reached toward the upp= er end of this range, the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the winter. At the expected injection rate, US inventories of 2,689 Bcf at the= =20 end of October would result in an end of March 2001 inventory level of 669 Bcf und= er normal winter weather, 89 Bcf below the previous record low of 758 Bcf. Regional Markets=01*Waiting for Winter The pipeline explosion on El Paso during late August intensified the=20 subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets. Cuts in pipeline flows=20 limited access into California on the only pipeline route into the state with any= =20 excess capacity. The lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the California market. Although summer power loads in California will ease and much of the El Paso capacity has be= en restored, the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter= =20 heating load will keep intense pressure on Topock prices. Differentials in the rest= =20 of the West will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t= o ease pipeline bottlenecks (see Table 3). Differentials in the East, which have traded in a narrow range this summer,= =20 will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in= =20 October. However, exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this= =20 year. CERA=01,s outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during October. CERA expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity, differentials will narrow. October differentials should average $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. The resumption of flows on El Paso=01,s southern system, combined with production outages, has relieved some of the access constraints on San Juan supply. Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow October differentials to $0.35 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. The continuing pull on supplies from the West will support Permian prices, and the Midwestern pull on supplies will support Mid-Continent prices. CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of $0.06 per MMBtu for Mid-Continent supplies and $0.11 per MMBtu for Permian supplies. * Chicago. The delay in the in-service date for Alliance from October 2 to October 30 will take some gas out of the Chicago market next month. This delay, combined with the need to build Midwest storage inventories, should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the $0.05=01)$0.08 range to above $0.10 per MMBtu. CERA expects October differentials at the Chicago citygate to average $0.11. * Northeast markets. Gas prices near $5.00 have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast, raising the floor level for differentials to near $0.30 per MMBtu. The beginning of the heating season and the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should support differentials above the floor during October, at near $0.40 per MMBtu. Canadian Markets=01*Outages Affect Supply Outages have affected supply thus far in September. Both British Columbia a= nd Alberta have been affected, resulting in a further year-over-year decline i= n Western Canadian supply. The various problems appear to be rectified, but t= he average supply for the month is likely to be down 100 to 150 million cubic= =20 feet (MMcf) per day from September 1999. Drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet=20 weather, but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels. More th= an 8,400 gas wells are expected for this year. Slight Drop in Export Demand Eastern Canadian demand is still down approximately 200 MMcf per day, with cooler-than-normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning. In the W= est however, cooler-than-normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand for heating requirements of about 200 MMcf per day. Exports are down slightly in September compared with September 1999, with PG&E GT-NW off 110 MMcf per day. Northern Border is running even with September 1999. Storage Picture Brighter in Canada Storage injections in eastern Canada have picked up, with inventories now expected to reach the five-year average of 210 Bcf. In the West, inventorie= s=20 at the end of the injection season will not only be above the five-year level = but should be even with those of 1999, at 250 Bcf. Wider Differentials Holding After widening substantially in August to US$1.17, the AECO-to-Henry differential has closed back to a more typical level of $0.60 in September.

Note:  Ken Lay's comments at the ""Governors' Natural Gas Summit:  Responding to the Growing Energy Crisis"" are quoted in this article. Industry Fears Consumer Backlash Because of High Prices The natural gas industry should be prepared to face customer revolts and attempts at price caps, similar to those witnessed this summer in San Diego if it's a cold winter and prices continue to hit new highs. That was the warning from government and industry representatives at the crisis conference held by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) yesterday. Representatives of producing states and industry speakers were unanimous in opposing government intervention to restrain prices, but no one had a ready remedy for consumer reaction if they are hit with a double whammy of greater energy use at higher prices this winter. One speaker offered a bright spot: the industry might emerge relatively unscathed if the winter is moderate. But then he added it's not just residential heating bills, but electric bills as well that will be impacted by higher natural gas prices. Others pointed out that demand and higher prices could spur lawmakers to open more areas to drilling and encourage new long lines. ""Industrial customers have been dealing with high prices for some time, but higher bills for residential and small commercial customers are just starting to hit the radar screen,"" Peggy Claytor, purchasing manager for steel-maker The Timken Co., told the group of more than 300 from the U.S., Canada and Mexico, meeting in Columbus, OH. ""We may see protests or proposals or calls for price caps this winter."" She said she is opposed to caps because they fail to solve the underlying problems, and she blamed the ""dysfunctional electricity grid"" in part for aggravating the run-up in natural gas prices. Asked whether he expected to see a public outcry from residentials this winter, Stephen L. Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary has borne the brunt of the California debacle (and whose 
Climate Prediction Center Winter  Outlook ? ??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South.

News Brief: Enterprise Acquires Acadian Natural Gas Pipeline System Enterprise Products Partners L.P. said its operating partnership has executed a definitive agreement to purchase Acadian Gas, LLC from Coral Energy, LLC, an affiliate of Shell Oil Company, for $226 million in cash, inclusive of working capital. Acadian's assets are comprised of the Acadian, Cypress and Evangeline natural gas pipeline systems, which together include over 1,000 miles of pipeline and have over one billion cubic feet per day of capacity. The system includes a leased natural gas storage facility at Napoleonville, LA with 3.4 Bcf of capacity. The acquisition expands Enterprise Products' platform of fee-based, midstream energy services to include natural gas transportation and storage. Completion of this transaction is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. The purchase is expected to be completed in the fourth 
Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural gas deliverability by the end of this year. NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and transportation-related services, structured power and management services and energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's existing asset valuation. Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with headquarters in Houston. ""By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three years,"" said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year.

Note:  The market reaction is interesting.  One can surmise that quite a bit of the gas that was contracted for on Vector is firm utility gas.  The run up in Chicago may be temporary until alternate arrangements are completed. Vector Delay Confirms Market's Suspicions Future shippers on the new Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline had their fears confirmed Tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start-up date for the project, which was scheduled for Nov. 1 to coincide with the start-up of the long-awaited Alliance Pipeline, would be delayed until Dec. 1. Vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered construction of the pipeline, which --- when completed --- would provide initial takeaway for about 700 MMcf/d of the 1.3 Bcf/d of western Canadian gas that will be shipped to the Chicago market by Alliance. Alliance is due to begin operations on Oct. 31. The announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million-dollar question: ""where will that [Alliance] gas go?"" in the meantime. Alliance officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and LDCs serving the Chicago hub that could pick up the slack between Oct. 31 and Dec. 1. Alliance's Jack Crawford downplayed the impact of the Vector start-up delay on Alliance. ""We don't think [there will be] much effect at all. We have been working closely with Vector. Our connection with them, if it's not ready, is very close. We also have five other connections with other [existing] pipelines and LDCs"" in Chicago. Many shippers ""understand [that with ] a startup the magnitude of ours [Alliance] and Vector's, there are likely to be

Lorna ---------------------------------------------------- Dear CERA Members and Friends: Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude prices?? What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful calculations? One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates' (CERA) core businesses has been benchmark crude oil price analysis. In our new multiclient study, ""The Hole in the Barrel"", CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the structure of the market itself.? We argue the limits and real economic losses that can result from misunderstanding these prices - specifically the Brent benchmark - in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning, the magnitude of which can be significant, often amounting to dollars - not cents - per barrel. As an introduction to this new study, we would like to invite you to participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web presentation on October 12, 2000.? With the current volatility and high levels of energy prices, this conference call will bring clarity to these important and relevant issues. To enroll for the call, please RSVP to 1-800-289-0579 or 719-457-2550 and reference the Confirmation Code 984848 in order to participate in the call. In this detailed study, CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk about the oil price.? As part of the study, we: * Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and consider their long-term future given the steady decline of ""wet"" barrels, including how other price markers might evolve. * Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues (for a given volume of production) than is generally appreciated. * Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices (absolute price level, time and grade differentials), to show where revenue is being lost and what can be done to add it back again. * Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming, especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that they help to manage. In this evolving New World, while trading may or may not be good for you, not understanding the market can be fatal. CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS: * Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of internationally traded crude oils. * The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate contracts in the Brent market to different sectors of the oil industry * The risks and rewards of dealing in the Brent market Our speakers will address this topic for 20-30 minutes, with accompanying graphics presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer period.

Coastal Corp. announced that Engage Energy U.S., L.P. has changed its name to Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which coincides with the split of the Engage Energy joint venture by participants Coastal and Westcoast Energy. Effective on Oct. 3, the operations were divided into separate entities which are owned and operated solely by each company. Coastal Merchant Energy, which handles up to 3.5 Bcf/d, appointed James C.

Kinder Morgan Transfers $300M in Assets to MLP Kinder Morgan, Inc. announced plans to contribute $300 million in assets to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., the company's master limited partnership. The largest asset to be contributed is Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, formerly MidCon Texas, a 2,600-mile natural gas pipeline system that extends from South Texas to Houston along the Texas Gulf Coast. Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing Systems, KMI's 50% interest in Coyote Gas Treating and KMI's 25% interest in Thunder Creek Gas Services. As consideration for the assets, KMI will receive $300 million, 50% in cash and 50% in KMP partnership units. KMI expects the transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. ""This transaction represents a true win-win for both KMI and KMP,"" said Kinder Morgan CEO Rich Kinder. ""It is expected to be accretive to cash available for distribution to KMP's unitholders by between 5-10 cents in 2001. The pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP because they complement existing KMP assets, have long-term contracts in place and offer significant growth opportunities."" Kinder noted that because the mix of consideration paid will include equity issued to KMI, it will not be necessary to raise funds for the transaction via a public offering of KMP units. ""KMI will also benefit from the transaction, as it will be able to reduce its debt by $150 million,"" Kinder said. ""Additionally, the transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share in 2001. By increasing its stake in the master limited partnership, KMI will enjoy 
Frontier Pipeline Project 
Note:  Williams does not give the amount of volume response they received in their open season.  540,000 Dth/d was their established volume at the onset.  Also, it is interesting that they are naming the Oklahoma intrastate markets as their market for the project. Western Frontier Pipe Gets Rave Reviews After successfully completing a non-binding open season on Sept. 21, for the Western Frontier project, Williams' gas pipeline unit plans to hold a binding open season in the near future to gauge the exact market interest in the project that would transport gas supply from the Rockies to the mid-continent region. ""We are very pleased with the interest the market has shown in our Western Frontier Project. We continue to believe that Western Frontier will be a cost-effective way to bring economically-priced Rockies supply into the mid-continent,"" said Kim Cocklin, vice president of customer services and rates for Williams' Central and Texas Gas pipeline systems. The Western Frontier Project is expected to transport up to 540,000 dth/d from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams' Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central system in southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton pipeline. The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Williams believes this project would be able to supply a ""seamless transport at an incremental cost"" to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central system. Through the Central system, customers would also be able to access storage including directly owned and third party storage fields. Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the mid-20 cents per dth. The company also expects a fuel rate of less than 1%. Expected to be in service during November 2003, the project will require the construction of almost 400 miles of pipeline and the addition of 13,000 HP. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Home Heating Costs to Soar this Winter Americans can expect home heating prices to jump as much as 44% this winter because of strong economic growth and high crude oil prices, according to the EIA. A winter with especially long periods of cold weather' could cause even higher prices because heating fuel storage levels are below average. Homes that use natural gas can expect to see the biggest jump in bills. Prices paid by residential customers are expected to average $8.58 per MMBtu, up about 30% from last winter's average of $6.61. The higher prices, combined with increased consumption, will push overall costs up to an average $780 this winter from $540 last year earlier, the EIA said in an annual report on winter fuels. High prices for competing petroleum-based fuels will help keep natural gas prices high. Homes with heating oil will pay about $949 for fuel this winter, up 25% from the $760  paid last winter. Prices will average about $1.37 per gallon, up 16% from last year's $1.18, the report said. The 4.5% of Americans who use propane to heat their homes will pay about 27% more this winter at $1,045, compared with $823 last year. Inventories of propane at the end of last month were about 62 million barrels, 3 million above last year's level. Distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, will be about 114 million to 118 million barrels at the start of the heating season, about 15% to 18% lower than last year, the report said. The government projection excludes the heating oil reserve created by the Clinton administration, which stores 2 million barrels. Distillate stocks in the East Coast are 41 million barrels, close to 40% less than last year's level. In New England stocks are over 60% below the 1999 level. The EIA estimated the monthly price of crude oil will remain above $28 per barrel for the rest of the year, and then gradually decline next year to an average $25 per barrel. Because of rising demand in Asia and continued growth in the US, higher oil production by OPEC has not been able to stem the rally in prices, the report said. US crude oil inventories are about 287 million barrels, 17 million barrels below last year. The deficit is smaller than last month, when there was a 26 million-barrel shortfall, though supplies are still 8% below normal and are not expected to move into the normal range before the end of winter, the report said.  Global oil demand this year is expected to increase 1.1 million barrels per day from last year and will grow by an additional 2 million barrels a day in 2001 to 78 million barrels a day, according to the report. The average retail price for gasoline, which was about $1.52 per gallon last week, will fall to about $1.46 per gallon in December and $1.40 by next March, the report said. The report says a very cold winter could cause Northeast heating oil prices to surge, and that could spill over into East Coast diesel markets. The government said the chances of this were greater this year because of tight distillate supplies, especially in the Northeast. Diesel prices will fall by about $0.09 to $1.55 per gallon in December and $1.35 by next summer, assuming normal conditions this

News Briefs: Chevron and Texaco Agree to $100 Billion Merger Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. announced plans to merge and ChevronTexaco Corp. In the merger, Texaco shareholders will receive 0.77 shares of Chevron common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron shareholders will retain their existing shares.  The exchange ratio represents approximately $64.87 per Texaco share based on Chevron's closing stock price of $84.25 on October 13.  The exchange ratio represents an 18% premium based upon Texaco's closing share price on October 13, and a 25% premium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during the 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron shareholders will own approximately 61% of the combined equity, and Texaco shareholders will own about 39%.  The combined company would have an enterprise value of more than $100 billion. The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and operations throughout the world.  In the U.S.,  ChevronTexaco would be the nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1 million BOE per day, and hold the nation's third largest reserve position,

Gas Storage--The Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20 approximately 8.5 Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag= e=20 5.5 Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of= =20 injections of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in= =20 futures prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of= =20 October.

Regional Markets-Winter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start = of=20 winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri= ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20 between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t= he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with = the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset= =20 of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe= r=20 (see Table 3). CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load, but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November. * San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu for November. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should continue through November, with some slight widening in the Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively. * Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels, but there is little added delivery capacity into that market. CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s. Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20 uncertain. A line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of= =20 200-300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio= n=20 the pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20 quantities of gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses= s=20 precisely the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October = is=20 on par with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in= =20 2000, approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20 shallow trend does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected = to=20 produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl= y=20 build is expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive= =20 growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have= =20 accelerated; eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e= nd of=20 October. Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect= ed storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20 levels. PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord= er Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte= d=20 to be slightly below 1999 levels in November.

High Prices, Wide Differentials The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20 October. For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti= ng=20 AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at= =20 http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

ONEOK Acquires 56,200 Dth/d From Williams Williams and ONEOK reported yesterday that they have reached a two-year agreement in which Williams will provide incremental firm transportation service of 56,200 Dth/d to the Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) division of ONEOK. ""We have had a long-standing relationship with ONEOK through our service to its Kansas Gas Service division and we look forward to helping ONEOK serve its growing energy needs in Oklahoma,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president of Williams Gas Pipeline-SouthCentral (Central and Texas Gas systems). Service will begin on Nov. 1, and will require Williams to build two new meter stations along its existing pipeline system. A spokesman for ONG said the gas load from Williams was necessary to serve its steadily growing customer base of approximately 800,000 as the company unbundles its services. The transportation capacity will be used to serve customers in ONG's Oklahoma City and Enid, OK, markets. 
Alliance Deliveries Delayed until Nov. 13 In a move that is likely to send ripples through the market, particularly around Chicago, the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline extended its commercial in-service delay last week to Nov. 13 from Oct. 30. Pipeline officials said moisture and debris in the line caused the delay. ""As we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system 
Calpine Form Alliance 
News Briefs: +Calpine to Acquire SkyGen Energy Calpine Corp. said it plans to acquire SkyGen Energy LLC (SkyGen Energy) from Michael Polsky and from Wisvest Corp., a Wisconsin Energy Corp. affiliate, for $450 million, plus the assumption of certain obligations of SkyGen Energy. The SkyGen Energy acquisition -- along with other recently announced acquisitions -- would increase Calpine's 2004 operating portfolio to over 40,000 MW of generation. Upon closing of the transaction, expected during the third quarter of 2000, Calpine will increase its power portfolio by up to 13,500 MW of natural gas-fired generation in the U.S., and will acquire 34 General Electric 7 FA gas turbines. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will add three operating facilities (780 MW), three projects under construction (812 MW), 13 late-stage development facilities (5,258 MW) and 16 project development opportunities (6,615 MW). SkyGen was founded by Michael Polsky in 1991. SkyGen will continue to develop its portfolio of development projects as a wholly owned subsidiary of Calpine. Michael Polsky will serve as President of SkyGen and as a member of Calpine's Board of Directors. To fund the SkyGen Energy and other recently announced acquisitions, Calpine has obtained a $1 billion short-term credit facility with The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse First Boston and CIBC World Markets. The company expects to refinance this facility in the capital markets. ********** +Panda, Calpine Form Business Alliance Panda Energy International and Calpine Corp. formed a  business alliance involving eight power plant projects Panda has under development, representing nearly 10,000 MW of generating capacity. Under terms of the agreement, Panda will provide development capabilities and carry each of the projects to the construction phase. Calpine will have exclusive rights to construct, own and operate the plants. Panda will participate in 50% of the cash flow, above Calpine's priority return, in all the projects within the alliance. Included in the pact is the acquisition by Calpine of 24 General Electric 7FA combustion gas turbines and 12 steam turbines scheduled for delivery in 2001 to 2002. The first project to be developed under the alliance will be the Oneta Power Partners, L.P., a 1,000 MW  natural gas-fueled power plant now being built in Coweta, OK. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will pay Panda approximately $126 million, which includes reimbursement of development costs, payments for the gas and steam turbines and the Oneta facility. The Oneta transaction is expected to close in July. It is 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, June 23, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: New Peaks, New Prices Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1247 , In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season, which, along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more frequent use of gas-fired generators to meet demand, causes steadily rising power prices. CERA expects the West to be the only region in North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as demand reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. The convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last year's levels, growing demand for power, and reduced hydroelectric energy production when compared with levels in 1999 is pushing up western power prices. Merchant and other gas-fired generators will be pressed into service, experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of 1994. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loads. The main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with year-earlier levels will be *  Peak WSCC load season. Summer weather will drive loads to the year's coincident peak, which is most likely to occur during the July/August period but could arrive any time during the June through October air-conditioning season. CERA expects demand growth of 3.1 percent in the third quarter compared with levels in 1999, which will push Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) coincident peak demand levels to 2.7 percent over 1999 levels. *  Waning hydroelectric output. Hydroelectric production is on its normal downward seasonal slide. This resource decline is more visible when compared with the 1999 hydro season, which was both abundant and prolonged. *  High utilization rates for gas-fired generators. Growing demand for electricity, coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy, will drive utilization rates of gas-fired power plants to their highest levels since the drought year of 1994. *  Higher fuel prices. Western gas prices have remained at $1.00-$1.50 per MMBtu above 1999 levels. Growing year-over-year gas demand for power generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets. These higher gas prices provide a boost to both on-peak and off-peak power prices of between $10 and $15 per megawatt-hour (MWh). Regional Power Market Drivers Power markets in the West are poised to break records for demand, peak load, and gas-fired plant utilization and, as a result, power prices. A return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will push demand for electricity up by 5,274 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the US West for the third quarter compared with 1999 levels, or almost 2,400 megawatts (MW) on average (see Table 1). This growth in the demand for electricity will also drive peak loads to new highs. CERA expects the 1999 WSCC coincident peak to be exceeded by 2.7 percent, climbing to nearly 119,000 MW. As was demonstrated by the mild summer of 1999, deviations from normal weather could boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure. Two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric production levels compared with 1999 levels. *  First, CERA expects West-wide total season hydroelectric production in 2000 of roughly 100 percent of historical average levels, substantially lower than the approximately 120 percent of average in 1999. *  Second, runoff was prolonged in 1999, serving to push a substantial portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period (see Figure 1). On average, CERA expects these factors will remove 9,187 GWh, or almost 4,200 average megawatts (aMW), from the western resource base compared with 1999 levels. Exacerbating this decline, refilling of reservoirs and flow restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant curtailments in power production at key Pacific Northwest hydroelectric facilities. Natural gas-fired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the expected increase in demand, while also replacing hydroelectric resources as they continue to decline. This will push average annual utilization rates of gas-fired combined cycle, steam, and cogeneration plants to approximately 38 percent in 2000--levels not experienced since the 41 percent annual average utilization rate in 1994, a year marked by drought and warmer-than-normal summer weather. Utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past 1999 levels, especially this summer. CERA anticipates a West-wide third quarter utilization rate of 59 percent for these facilities under normal summer weather conditions, compared with 46 percent for the same period of 1999. This level of utilization will certainly establish gas-fired generation as the floor to power prices during the third quarter, during not only the on-peak demand period but the off-peak as well. With natural gas prices at $1.00-$1.50 per MMBtu higher than 1999 levels, power prices are boosted by $10-$15 per MWh owing to fuel price increases alone. With supply tightness already evident in western power markets, the stage is set for increased price volatility compared with 1999 levels as episodes of hot weather require increased utilization of less-efficient generators throughout this summer. Pacific Northwest The water supply forecast for the Columbia River remains near average but has dropped a couple percentage points from last month. Flows are expected to remain at roughly 96 percent of average through September on the Lower Columbia and 103 percent of average on the Upper Columbia. Conditions overall are still sufficient to be considered average. This return to normal conditions in the Pacific Northwest should produce hydroelectric output nearly 2,700 GWh (18 percent) lower than last year for July and 8,405 GWh lower for the third quarter as a whole (see Table 2). The region's load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to elevate power prices in the Pacific Northwest relative to 1999 levels. Tighter supply conditions in California and the Southwest will attract energy exports from the Pacific Northwest, preserving a differential between the Pacific Northwest and California of about $1 per MWh on average. Price differentials between the Pacific Northwest and California have varied dramatically recently, with the north at times rising above those to the south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir filling operations. Since the end of May, volatility in both markets has pushed the difference between daily on-peak prices at COB and those in California from a premium of $120 per MWh to a discount of $55 per MWh within a few days. CERA expects that over the long run, California markets will clear at a premium as the summer progresses, but the differential will vary widely, with episodes of Pacific Northwest power pricing at a premium to those in California. California Despite below-average precipitation and snowpack this year, California reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal, ranging between 108 and 166 percent of average for the state's primary runoff regions. Under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly 4 percent (363 GWh) below last year's levels for the third quarter (see Table 2). With a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter 1999, cooling demand this summer will increase most in California, where weather was nearly 30 percent cooler than average last year. Recent day-ahead power prices in California have drawn attention to the West as the highest-cost market (if only temporarily) in North America. Record high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new day-ahead price records, with power prices on June 15 at $457 per MWh in the day-ahead on-peak market and real-time hourly prices at the market cap of $750 per MWh. Increased utilization of gas-fired generation and daily gas prices of around $5 per MMBtu (burner-tip in Southern California) have kept daily average off-peak prices between $40 and $80 per MWh. Notably, these higher price have occurred during periods when roughly 1,800 MW more coal-fire generation was available in the West compared with the same period in 1999. CERA expects prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer. Rockies and Southwest During summer 1999, the Rockies/Southwest was the only region to experience above-average cooling demand, suggesting that normal weather should bring only moderate demand growth of less than 1 percent (see Table 3). However, growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission transfer capability will pull energy from the Rockies/Southwest region when excess capacity is available, ensuring that prices in the region will remain tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the West. Palo Verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets, while maintaining their characteristic premium to the California Power Exchange during spring and early summer. CERA expects Southwest prices to strengthen relative to California when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of demand to the Southwest. However, California prices will maintain a premium on average to those in the Southwest, as the effects of the state's tight supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the Southwest or Pacific Northwest. Regional Gas Market Drivers Under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining supply and increasing gas demand for power generation, gas prices at the Henry Hub are expected to average $4.45 per MMBtu in July. The strong demand for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern half of the West. In the Rockies, pipeline constraints will keep differentials wide. The heightened call on gas demand for power generation, driven by the declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads, is expected to drive demand increases of 1.6 Bcf per day relative to July 1999 and 660 MMcf per day relative to June 2000 demand levels. Gas demand for power generation is expected to reach a monthly average record level of 4.9 Bcf per day in July (see Tables 4 and 5). These increases will result in declines in western storage injection rates and in exports from the West. Both Permian and San Juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the West Coast during July. Low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving North American gas pricing. The West is the one US region actually running a storage surplus, but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas supplies have eroded that surplus, particularly in California (see Table 6). Given the expected increases in gas demand, the western surplus should continue its decline. This decline and very high demand will reinforce the volatility in differentials already evident this summer. California Because of the early hot weather in the West and strong gas demand for power generation, Topock prices have been extremely high and volatile. So far this month, Topock has averaged over $0.30 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub. Flows on El Paso and Transwestern into California increased by over 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day during June relative to May averages, and flows are expected to continue to climb by an additional 400 MMcf per day during July. PGT continues to run near capacity (see Table 7). At the same time, the storage levels within California look likely to fall below last year's levels sometime during the month. This intense demand pressure--California demand should increase by nearly 500 MMcf per day in July relative to June--will keep utilization rates on import pipelines high and sustain Topock differentials. CERA expects the Topock to Henry Hub differential to average $0.30 per MMBtu during July (see Table 8). This high differential will likely persist through the summer, with differentials rising above $0.50 per MMBtu during West Coast heat waves. Southwest San Juan price differentials have been volatile, narrowing during periods of very high western demand. However, a very high utilization rate on pipeline capacity into California has widened the Topock-San Juan differential, and that wide gap is expected to persist. On average, San Juan differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern demand increases with western temperatures. Demand in the Southwest is expected to climb from 1.4 Bcf per day in June to 1.5 Bcf per day in July. This increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in Permian prices should result in an average San Juan differential to the Henry Hub of $0.18 per MMBtu. In the Permian Basin, prices are expected to strengthen as Texas power demand climbs. Combined with the pull on supplies from the West, Permian differentials should narrow from their current levels of $0.20 per MMBtu to below $0.10 per MMBtu. Pacific Northwest Strong June hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest so far this summer, but as hydroelectric output decreases in June and July, gas demand will increase dramatically. CERA expects an increase of nearly 200 MMcf per day during July relative to June levels. The limited demand so far has meant differentials between Malin and the Henry Hub of as much as $0.30 per MMBtu and Topock to Malin differentials of over $0.60 per MMBtu. The Malin to Henry Hub differential has narrowed slightly to around $0.20 per MMBtu. It should continue to strengthen with growth in regional demand and average $0.00 per MMBtu during July. Rocky Mountains Regional gas supply within the Rocky Mountains continues to increase, bolstered by continuing growth in the Powder River Basin. This April, exports out of the Rockies reached 3.2 Bcf per day, a record high. Although there is excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the Southwest on the Transcolorado and Northwest pipelines, high utilization rates have widened Rockies differentials with the rest of the West. In particular, Rockies to San Juan differentials have averaged nearly $0.25 per MMBtu for June after pricing close to parity earlier in the year. That gap should persist through the summer, as gas-fired generation climbs across the rest of the West. Demand is expected to average the same level in July as in June in the Rocky Mountains, where coal limits gas's gains in power generation. CERA expects prices within the Rockies to gather some support from increasing power loads in the Pacific Northwest, as well as from stronger differentials in the San Juan Basin. On average, Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub are expected to average $0.52 per MMBtu during July. In response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the Powder River Basin and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines, Trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend and expand the 500 mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska. Although timing and volumes have yet to be announced, the additional capacity could prevent serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region, which CERA would expect by 2002 without capacity additions. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables.

American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=3D5526&m=3D1402 , Alternative URL:=20 http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/102600_15/nag_alt_102600_15_ab.html ********************************************************* Warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the foc= us=20 in the gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growi= ng=20 sense that supplies might just prove adequate. The result has been a steady and= =20 steep decline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 into the $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t= he=20 mid- $5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua= l=20 fuel oil in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20 inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade= quate supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to= a=20 quick return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap. Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe= r=20 20 accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif= t=20 in market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima= tely=20 3.8 Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and = 58=20 Bcf above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob= er=20 22. With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20 expected next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o= n October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table= =20 1). Is this inventory level ""enough""? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter= =20 under 15- year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf= =20 above the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20 withdrawals in the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo= ve=20 last year=01,s withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac= e=20 of a return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul= d bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20 winter, holding withdrawals down requires both of the following: * Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down. These markets represent approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return, should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol. * The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas. In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,= =20 particularly as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20 demand can be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c= an=20 be held reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar= ch=20 1996 and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag= e=20 of $3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was= =20 nearly 4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa= s=20 lower, and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20 customers in the United States.

This is CERA's Western Market forecast for November. Lorna ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Tue, October 24, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: No Rest for a Weary Market Author: E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: Western Energy , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1400 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/ce/alt/102400_18/ce_alt_102400_18_ab.html ********************************************************* Rather than enjoying a respite, western energy markets will make November a catch-up month. Natural gas demand will remain high when compared with the same period last year, as gas-fired generation will continue to run at high utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal levels. The tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas prices, which will range from $5.15 to $5.83 per million British thermal units, depending on location. Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired generation on the margin for most of November. On-peak power prices will remain higher as a result, in the $86-$98 per megawatt-hour range, depending on location. **end** Follow URL for complete report. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Quick Change in PG&E NW IT Allocation Within hours of a FERC vote yesterday ratifying proposed changes in its interruptible transportation (IT) queue, PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest announced new procedures effective today. The Commission rejected shippers complaints to the new scheme and accepted PG&E NW's tariff sheets as of Oct. 25, saying the revisions were ""generally in accord with industry practice and will simplify capacity allocation 
Note:  I am not sure this will have a downstream impact... thought I'd pass it on anyhow.  Lorna Kern River has scheduled semi-annual inspections for the Solar turbine compressors at Muddy Creek (WY) Station for Nov. 7-10.

Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market, free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J.

El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major player. The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the non-fee-based side. As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  Raymond James and Associates is predicting gas prices to average $4.50 in 2001.  Consensus First Call estimates are now averaging $3.85 for 2001.  Read on to hear what the brokerage houses are predicting. Lorna Raymond James Sends Chills Up Gas Buyers' Spines Raymond James and Associates gave gas buyers a Halloween shriek yesterday that could be producing chills all the way through next April, perhaps even all of next year. The firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas prices this winter and said it expects prices to average $4.50/MMBtu in 2001. ""Regardless of a potentially warm winter, it is highly likely that the United States will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply,"" Raymond James said in its latest energy report. ""In other words, gas storage should test all-time low levels this winter regardless of weather. ""The situation should get worse, not better, next year. If we end the winter at all-time low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than we did this summer, then we should enter next winter with dangerously low levels of natural gas,"" Raymond James added. ""We believe that the United States will see gas demand increase by about 9 Bcf/d (or 15%) by the end of 2002 as new gas fired electric generation plants come on line. Unfortunately, even if every drilling rig is working, U.S. gas supply is likely to increase by less than 4 Bcf/d by the end of 2002. This means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over 5 Bcf/d of demand out of the gas supply/demand equation by 2002. At $5/Mcf, only about 1.5 Bcf/d of demand has been reduced so far. That means that gas prices must go 
Note:  There will be a briefing meeting on the project in Denver on Nov. 14 N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with direct access to several local distribution companies, including Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, NGPL, Northern and Vector. The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering ""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value. Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14.

El Paso declared an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Thursday that will remain in effect until further notice. The pipeline said it will limit scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system integrity. Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance

Note:  FYI Fitch Puts 2 CA Utilities on Negative Watch In the midst of the continuing uncertainty over regulatory treatment of growing wholesale electricity cost under-collections, Fitch Tuesday assigned a ""rating watch negative"" designation to the securities of California's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison (and its parent company, Edison International). In addition, it lowered Edison's commercial paper rating one notch to ""F1"" from ""F1+"". Fitch cited the need for ""significant and extensive regulatory decisions"" to resolve the continuing problem of retail utility electric rate under-collections plaguing both utilities. It indicated that with the ""watch negative"" status, the independent rating service expects to review the ratings within six months. A spokesperson for PG&E Corp., the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric, said the Fitch move doesn't lower any of its ratings, but it ""underscores the seriousness of the situation (in California) and the need for all the parties to come together for a collaborative solution."" The companies have asked for relief from the California Public Utilities Commission (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). Edison is the target of an investors' lawsuit which accuses it of illegally booking as revenue the wholesale power costs that have yet to be collected. (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1). The Fitch move had no effect on PG&E's latest utility debt line extension of $1.3 billion that was implemented recently in response to the continuing under-collections, the spokesperson said. Fitch reiterated that through September the two utilities had booked under-collections exceeding $5 billion collectively and that wholesale power prices continue to exceed the utilities' frozen retail rate levels. ""While these amounts exceed immediate funding requirements, their recovery through rates is uncertain,"" Fitch stated in its announcement on the negative watch. ""Barring a change in regulatory policy, PG&E and SoCal Edison anticipate they will be unable to recover their under-collections before the end of the statutory rate freeze period ending March 31, 2002. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
El Paso extended an unauthorized overpull penalty situation yesterday for all customers. ""You are urged to immediately review your supply/demand balance, and the performance of your suppliers, to insure sufficient gas is being delivered to El Paso to cover the gas being taken off the system,"" the pipeline said. To ensure system integrity, El Paso is placing limits on scheduled volumes at interconnects that are underperforming.

PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 levels. The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit charge. ""We're just keeping our legal options open,"" said a San Francsco-based utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders. Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9 billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's 
Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time (400-500 MMBtu/d hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to commission the Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through. Some predictors are saying the delay may get longer. Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. ""Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has been removed from the line,"" says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. ""However, periodic reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago."" A spokesman said the debris included ""bits of foam"" that came off equipment used to extract moisture following hydrostatic testing. The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the operation together around the clock 365 days a year. ""It's a tremendously complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A consent agreement has been filed with the FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP. El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would result in a $20 million loss. The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General. 
Note:  CERA gives a storage prediction for end of withdrawal season under a normal winter. ********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, November 10, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Taking up the Slack Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1415 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111000_11/nag_alt_111000_11_ab.html Cold weather in the Midwest and reduced storage injections have taken up much of the temporary slack that developed in the gas market during the warm October. As expected, prices have responded quickly to the cold, with the December futures contract price advancing by over $0.75 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the past week. As cold weather develops, late winter supply availability is still uncertain in CERA's view. For that reason, dual-fuel markets must remain off of gas, and market fundamentals support the recent price rebound, which places gas prices again at a premium to resid. CERA estimates that US working storage inventories as of the end of October were approximately 2,746 billion cubic feet (Bcf), an all-time low for that date by 64 Bcf (see table below). Storage injections of 36 Bcf for the week ending November 3 were higher than a normal weather pattern would indicate, but more normal weather for the remainder of the month would result in withdrawals averaging 3.5 Bcf per day during November. This withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards but 2.5 Bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two years (see table below). This pace of withdrawals places inventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of 771 Bcf under normal winter weather conditions, only 13 Bcf above the previous all-time low. This market remains tight. Although added supplies will begin to help by the end of the winter, for now some demand must still be priced out of the market in order to preserve storage inventories. **end** Follow URL for HTML version of this message only. ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate Program, the company said. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002.

Williams to Expand Kern River by 124,500 Dth/d Kern River Gas Transmission, a subsidiary of Williams, said it planned on filing an application yesterday with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The company said the California Expansion Project will not only provide additional natural gas capacity from Wyoming to markets in California, but also will provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for firm transportation based on the recent approval by FERC of Kern River's Extended Term Rate Program. ""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. The project includes construction of three new compressor stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. Kern River said the $80 million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. The company said demand for firm transportation on Kern River was driven by several factors: the diversion of Canadian gas supplies to markets in the Midwest from the Pacific region; increased production in the Rocky Mountain basin; strong economic growth in Kern River's market areas; and increased demand from gas-fired electric generation facilities. Williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the Kern River pipeline. ""The demand for competitively priced transportation to markets in Nevada and California continues to grow. At the same time, gas producers in the Rocky Mountain basin are stepping up production. An 
Kern River discovered a mechanical problem with an oil seal at the Fillmore Compressor Station in Utah. Fillmore will be inoperable while repairs are made Nov. 30, but no impact to firm capacity is expected. However, interruptible capacity will be reduced as necessary for the Nov. 28-29 gas days and will not be available Nov. 30. Northwest noted that despite putting its system into entitlement and issuing a realignment OFO, primary scheduled volumes through Kemmerer (WY) Station remain greater than physical capacity. Therefore, starting today the pipeline is invoking a ""must-flow OFO"" provision of its tariff. Until further notice, shippers with primary corridor rights southbound through Kemmerer are required to flow up to 10% of their contract demand from receipt points north of Kemmerer to delivery points south of Kemmerer or take some other mutually agreeable action to alleviate the Kemmerer capacity problem. See the Northwest bulletin board for details. El Paso:  Saying linepack had stabilized, El Paso canceled Wednesday an

American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111500_18/nag_alt_111500_18_ab.html ********************************************************* After a warm October, the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November, a heavy early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter. Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750 billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record low heading into the heating season, and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next, difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil, but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end users may be required. None of these measures comes easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time high for December. But even this estimate could prove low. If the current cold snap extends through early December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00 per MMBtu range. Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month, increasing the withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of the past two years. By the end of this month, the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to 350 Bcf. CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996 all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter, as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced out of the market. Demand-Keeping Warm After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter (November through March) was the warmest of the decade, and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season. Under normal weather conditions, * Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5 Bcf per day higher than last year's. * Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day in January. * December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per day relative to last December. Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day relative to normal weather. Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight, there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run, which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market. This winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 MMcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of 4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November, with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching. Supply-The Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the soaring gas-related rig count. * The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in 2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam play. * Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews. Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February, with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline. Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again, this time until December 1. Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf per day. During November that total should climb to 750 MMcf per day, despite the later published start date. With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast, differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA expects a December average differential of $0.25 per MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward $0.50 per MMBtu. * San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average $0.20 per MMBtu. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per MMBtu for December. * Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15 per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices $0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at $5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000 MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's weather be colder than normal, we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000. These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized. Canadian Markets-Winter Begins The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East. Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf below the five-year average. Even with modest withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs. Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well above the five-year average. With the eastward movement of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin. This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada. The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal ""freeze-up,"" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year. Further Delays for Alliance? The ""commercial"" in-service date for Alliance has been delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line, delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant, the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up since September. It is estimated that flows for November will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year- over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern Canada. High Prices: Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a result of this increased pull. For December, the differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.10 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this message with associated Tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Western Undeterred By Grueling Regulatory Process Expressing frustration but continuing its resolve, Texas-based Western Hub Properties is ironing out some ""technical issues"" of financing with California regulators and now expects to start construction in February on its delayed Lodi gas storage field in northern California. The merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year, said Western Hub's California-based manager, Jim Fossum, who added that with faster approvals, the project could have been in service during this summer's electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages. Despite the regulatory struggle, he said the company still plans to go through with its other California storage project near Bakersfield and the natural gas hub called Wheeler Ridge. Western has acquired leases on the property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed site over the first three to six months of next year. The company intends to make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001. In both the approved Lodi project (see Daily GPI, May 19) and the proposed Wheeler Ridge storage field, Western is not concerned about lining up customers, said Fossum. The projects are not contingent on contracts, he said. ""Now that we are a bona fide (certified plant) utility under the California Public Utilities Commission, we are getting some technical things worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces 
El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection program. Line 1100 between Eunice and Pecos River Stations will be smart pigged Sunday (postponed one day), causing a 200 MMcf/d flow reduction through Eunice to the South Mainline. Six interconnects will not be able to deliver into El Paso for 10 hours that day. Another smart pigging of Line 1100 between Pecos River and Guadalupe Stations will occur Nov. 22 (also postponed one day), requiring a reduction of 200 MMcf/d through Pecos River. Line 1203 (Maricopa Line) pigging will be done Nov. 21-24, reducing the line's capacity by 60 MMcf/d and affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the Phoenix area.

In a letter last month (see Daily GPI, Oct. 19), Northwest announced a policy revision allowing a shipper holding capacity from Sumas to off-system delivery points to amend primary delivery points and shorten the path without being subject to a contractual OFO upon extending its contract term. However, citing ""the current OFO situation on the pipeline system,"" Northwest said last week the policy change is under review and has been suspended until further notice. El Paso reported Thursday an injection unit at its Washington Ranch storage facility had gone down for emergency maintenance. Capacity through Pecos River Station has been reduced by 100 MMcf/d until further notice, causing the pipeline to impose allocations on Permian Basin production and deliveries of San Juan Basin gas to the South Mainline. El Paso said work on Lines 1106 and 1107 was extended by one more day, causing the shut-in of deliveries into El Paso at the IUTBENED and IHYBENDM interconnects to continue through Dec. 1. The delay also postpones scheduled work on Line 3137, which now will be shut in Dec. 4-5, affecting the IVALEROZ, ISONORA, ISHOZONA and IBARNHRT points. Line 3177 is scheduled for Dec. 7 inspection, affecting IMOBILPE.

Transportation Notes Projecting that linepack would slip below its minimum target level through Thursday, Pacific Gas & Electric issued a systemwide Stage 3 OFO, effective today until further notice. The order carries penalties of $5/Dth for negative daily imbalances exceeding a 3% tolerance. As a result of warmer area weather and banking on its system, Northwest said it is operationally feasible to loosen conditions of its entitlement for delivery points north of Kemmerer (WY) Station. A Declared Stage II (8% tolerance) Overrun Entitlement will take effect today; through Tuesday the pipeline was in a Stage I (3%) Entitlement. A shipper is subject to penalties for overtakes north of Kemmerer that exceed an amount 8% greater than its confirmed nominations. El Paso will take the B turbine at Cornudas Station in West Texas down for maintenance today and Thursday, reducing South Mainline capacity there by 60 MMcf/d. However, Cornudas capacity has not been fully utilized recently, the pipeline said, so this reduction should not affect current markets. The Kinder Morgan pipeline group (NGPL, Kinder Morgan Interstate, Trailblazer, Canyon Creek, KN Wattenburg and TransColorado) reminded shippers it has a new 24-hour hotline phone number for information and questions about point confirmations and related issues: (713) 369-9683.

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market. NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis market. ""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is scheduled for completion in June of 2002. NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the area. ""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season will determine the final scope of the project. ""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the Houston audience. ""In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry,"" he said, pointing to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things upside down. When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy companies are now adopting that method. In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy industry. ""We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom of this synopsis, the web site address  will direct you to the full report released today if you would like further information. EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from $2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's latest report. EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for about half the change in energy projections. EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. ""In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Thu, November 30, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: CERA Insight: The Gales of November Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1432 , Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/113000_15/nag_alt_113000_15_ab.html ********************************************************* Cold November weather, with heating degree-days 22 percent above normal through the twenty-fifth, fueled withdrawals from storage that CERA estimates will average approximately 8.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day for the month, near the all-time record for November set in 1995. This is approximately 5.0 Bcf per day higher than the previously expected withdrawal rate under normal weather conditions. The result is that storage inventories as of the end of the month are about 500 Bcf below the year-earlier level and are on track to dip well into record low territory by the end of the winter (see Table 1). For December, normal weather would result in storage withdrawals of 17.0 Bcf per day on average for the month. At that rate, storage inventories would fall below 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the year, the first time that has ever occurred. By the end of March CERA expects working inventories to be reduced to 606 Bcf in the United States, compared with the previous record low of 758 Bcf. This weather and high withdrawal rates have moved prices higher within the wide and volatile range between residual fuel oil and distillate, with gas prices moving farther above those of resid ($4.75 to $5.00) and closer to the price of distillate fuel oil (approximately $7.00). Strength in the oil market has kept the resid-distillate range high, but should gas test either boundary of this range, the price of either distillate or resid would move as well. Under normal weather CERA now expects December prices to average $6.25 at the Henry Hub, a higher level within this range reflective of reduced storage inventories. Although prices have abated somewhat in recent days and will continue to rise and fall with weather and weather forecasts, fundamentals now are so tight that a return to cold weather would quickly drive prices back above $6.50 and potentially above $7.00 at the Henry Hub. It is only at that level or above that any significant additional demand response is likely, and even then such a response would require time. The possibility of curtailments of interruptible loads late this winter has grown, while the possibility of significant price relief appears increasingly remote. **end** Follow URL for HTML version of this message with associated Table. ********************************************************* Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, ""Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future"" in Houston, February 12-16, 2001!

With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters. With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the ""next big investment opportunity for the coming decade."" In Winters' 250 page report, ""Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: Set for a Revolution-Part 2,"" he examines technologies and companies within the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage of the current situation. ""Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in the early 1980's,"" said Winters. ""Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of high quality, reliable power,"" added Winters. According to his research, microturbines are the best positioned of the ""new"" technologies that would be able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, efficient and very versatile. ""They can be used as a main power source, a back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in traditional energy prices,"" the analyst said. ""Microturbines can also be used in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access to electricity."" Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other fuels as well. In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering flywheel technology, as a ""buy"" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading manufacturer of microturbines, as ""attractive."" The companies are in addition to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Fri, December 08, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: The Storm Arrives Author: N. American Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/120800_16/nag_alt_120800_16_ab.html ********************************************************* Cold Weather Path Colder-than-normal weather through November and forecasted cold for the first half of December throughout the Midwest and Northeast have driven gas prices well into record territory, with the January Henry Hub price trading near $9.00 per MMBtu and closing above $8.00 on the New York Mercantile Exchange December 6. This six-week cold period and the quick depletion of already low storage inventories has established prices at or above CERA's cold weather path for the remainder of the winter and in all likelihood beyond. If December storage withdrawals are as high as CERA now expects, the gas market will remain on the cold weather path through 2001 as well, even if weather returns to normal during the second half of December. The enormous increase in storage injections that is likely to be required next summer would keep the pressure on gas markets throughout the year. So long as weather remains cold (or even normal) this winter, a new market dynamic is in effect in which gas prices interact more with distillate fuel oil prices rather than with those of residual fuel oil. In addition, gas is likely to have an increasingly direct influence on power prices in the growing number of regions in which gas-fired generation is now on the margin in winter. This winter, the gas market is likely to rediscover for the first time in decades which end users value natural gas most highly, and which ultimately do not. The gas market is also rediscovering the value of firm pipeline capacity, particularly into market areas. Both the West Coast and the Northeast have experienced even more extreme price spikes, with daily prices in both regions peaking above $20.00 per MMBtu. Indeed, the shortage of gas in California is so acute that prices above $40.00 per MMBtu have been reported. If sustained, these price levels will induce a political reaction that will reverberate throughout the industry. Storage Update-Even High Seems Low Panic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat as storage withdrawals for the week ending December 1, at 73 billion cubic feet (Bcf), proved to be less than expected. This withdrawal was half the previous week's rate, and in CERA's view actual withdrawals for both weeks probably lie between these two readings. (In some cases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings in the AGA survey.) But even the 73 Bcf figure, though a significant retreat from the previous week's rate, is high by historical standards. One would have to go back to 1994 to find a higher reading for a comparable week in the AGA survey. Inventories as of the beginning of December, at an estimated 2,466 Bcf (see Table 1), were 525 Bcf below the year-earlier level, and this deficit is likely to increase substantially during December. If weather forecasts indicating colder-than-normal weather through mid-December in key heating markets hold true, storage withdrawals for the month will average approximately 20.0 Bcf per day. This rate is an increase from CERA's normal weather estimate of 17.0 Bcf per day, and even this rate depends on weather returning to normal in mid- December. This level of withdrawals would leave only 1,846 Bcf in storage on January 1, an inventory 663 Bcf below the year-earlier level. Assuming normal weather, such an inventory would place storage on track to reach a March minimum of 488 Bcf, 270 Bcf below the 1996 record low. At a US inventory level this low, many storage operators would be dipping into base-load gas in order to support service even to firm gas customers. * Physical deliverability from storage fields will be significantly lower this year in midwinter, forcing a greater reliance on pipeline gas and peaking facilities during January and February. The actual reduction in field deliverability is impossible to quantify, but storage inventories cannot be withdrawn at steady rates throughout the winter; withdrawal rates decline with inventory as field pressure is reduced. *  Pressure in the market will be reinforced and extended through 2001 and probably into 2002. During the past two summers, high prices have been required to discourage demand and allow overall US storage injections to reach barely 1.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). If normal weather holds for the remainder of this winter, 2.2 Tcf of injections-which would be nearly impossible to achieve-would be required during 2001 if inventories are to recover to 2.7 Tcf at peak. If weather this winter is merely normal from mid-December through March, going into winter next year the United States will have considerably less gas in storage. Reaching even the 2,362 Bcf level, according to CERA estimates (see Table 1), would require an additional 275 Bcf of injections next year, and that alone would prove challenging. Price-The Cold Weather Path The weakness of storage inventories and the demand pressure in both core and power generation markets created by the cold weather have caused prices to move onto and even above CERA's cold weather path for this winter (see Table 2). Storage inventories would become perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather through mid-December proves accurate, and the injections required next summer would keep pressure in the market intense. For these reasons CERA's outlook for prices for January and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold weather path.  Prices could take an even higher path, particularly if colder-than-normal weather endures beyond mid-December or returns on a sustained basis in January or February. Several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will begin to enter the market during the winter, but these are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the winter is over. Such factors include a building US supply capability, growing imports, softening oil prices (allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter ends), and potentially weakening economic growth. Although the influence of these factors will increase, it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement that appears more and more certain next summer. Demand-The Difficult Next Round of Switching With gas prices hitting new record highs, CERA expects some additional demand to be priced out of the market. Because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most weeks since May, however, the easiest fuel switching in the power generation and industrial sectors has already occurred. Even though gas prices are currently above the level of distillate (approximately $7.23 per MMBtu in New York), switching from gas to distillate requires changes in long-standing consumer habit, will occur only over time, and is likely limited in volume. Significant switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of distillate itself. There are four major sources of additional demand response in industrial markets: * Additional switching to resid in industrial boilers. The next increment of demand to come out of the market is likely to be in the industrial sector, through additional fuel switching to resid (and to some extent to distillate). These markets will continue to show some flexibility but will not represent a large volume. CERA estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably already begun to lose small amounts (less than 0.5 Bcf per day) in switching to resid, given the consistency of gas price premiums greater than $0.50 per MMBtu. * Investment in restoring switching capability. As premiums move far beyond this level, industrial end users can be expected to take a closer look at reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their initial short-term levels. However, such a change would require investment by industrial end users and the availability of resid in oil markets. CERA estimates that with focused investment over the course of a number of months to perhaps a year, switching to resid could eventually reach as high as 1.3 Bcf per day. There is already some movement here; given the impact of high gas prices on earnings, energy prices have already begun to receive management attention. * Switching to distillate. US Department of Energy data suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical capability of switching nearly 1.3 Bcf per day to distillate in the short term. This switch would represent additional distillate demand of over 200,000 barrels per day (bd) in a US market of 3.8 million barrels. This marginal demand would move the distillate price in tandem with gas price, and any additional switching among power generators to distillate would reinforce this price correlation. In addition, the availability of distillate inventories on site should restrict the quick switching to short periods of time and will not offer a long-term solution to tight markets. * Shutting down industrial plants. Also offering some flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that use gas as a feedstock. The major feedstock consumers are the ammonia and methanol industries, and, not surprisingly given the tight margins available, manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to show suppressed gas demand. However, in the short term only a portion of ammonia production is at risk. Whereas the production needs of merchant facilities along the Gulf Coast is relatively readily replaced by imports, substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast (because of transportation logistics) and for facilities whose production is linked to value-added fertilizer products. Hence, CERA still estimates that even with nonexistent margins, substantial ammonia production would continue, with additional losses of perhaps 200 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of potential demand in addition to the facilities that have already closed. Extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the shuttering of North American methanol capacity, putting at risk another 100 to 200 MMcf per day of gas demand for that sector. Switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated in the chemicals, paper, and refining sectors in the South and the food products sector in the Midwest. Continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the South Central region. For process users, even extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have little impact on the use of gas in the short term. Energy costs are not the dominant component of production costs for these users, and a physical changeover would be time-intensive and elemental in its impact on end-use product quality. The Northeast-Cold Weather Operations Begin All of the Northeast pipelines have issued notices to customers that they either have imposed, or are highly likely to need to impose, transportation restrictions of various types. The most common restriction is to nonprimary firm services (secondary and interruptible type services), which will be scheduled for the next several days on many pipelines. Other pipelines have issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and deliveries must match. Even hourly flow orders have also been implemented. These actions are normal for winter operations when a cold period is expected. Whereas the firm market for natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions, the spot market becomes much more volatile as interruptible supplies dry up. The spot market, primarily made up of nonfirm customers, has had a dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of delivered spot gas into the market area, as has been reflected by the volatility of the cash market this week. The result of these restrictions of nonprimary firm services has been an expansion of basis to Henry Hub. At one point, gas for next-day delivery to New York traded near $24.00 per MMBtu delivered, although the average price was closer to $14.20. These high spikes are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas. Although these restrictions will likely ease as temperatures return closer to normal, CERA now expects basis into the New York citygate to average $1.31 per MMBtu for December and $1.36 per MMBtu for January. **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated tables. ********************************************************* Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek2001, ""Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future"" in Houston, February 12-16, 2001!

High Prices Force Chemicals to Sell Gas, Futures Chemical companies, forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices, are nevertheless making money --- by selling gas futures contracts. Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp. became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs. Iowa-based Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December natural gas purchases, and shutdown 50% of its Verdigis, OK, ammonia facility. The company had previously reported that it would not operate its Bytheville, AR, and Beaumont, TX, facilities during the month of December as well. In a similar maneuver, Mississippi Chemical Corp., a producer of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium-based products in Mississippi, Louisiana and New Mexico, reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from January forward, in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices. Mississippi Chemical said it expects to realize a pre-tax gain of $16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31 from the recently sold contracts. The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices. An overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low, while gas prices, a feedstock for some chemicals, continue to climb. The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products, said Ron Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute. Duke Energy's Ken Nyiri, divisional director of strategic planning and research, commented on Mississippi Chemical's transactions, ""I guess they probably made about a $4/MMBtu margin on the gas, which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia; in fact, they would have lost $30/unit. Their ammonia was probably costing them about $205/ton to make (with gas bought at $5/MMBtu in November) and the market today is at $205 so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs. By selling the gas at around $9/MMBtu they made $4/MMBtu. It was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it, or do they sell the gas

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to markets in New Jersey and New York. Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered by the original certificate. The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The $80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines currently are running full. 
Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge new rival for Western Canadian supply. ""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
CALPINE SAYS 500-MW TEXAS NATGAS POWER PLANT ON LINE Calpine Corp. , the nation's largest independent power company, said Wednesday its 500-megawatt (MW) natural gas-fired Hidalgo Energy Center in Texas began commercial operation on June 14. - 
Calpine Announces Development of 600-MW Energy Center Calpine Corporation announced that through a development agreement with Adair International Oil and Gas, Inc. it has secured the rights to develop, build, own and operate a 600-MW natural gas-fired electricity generating facility near the town of Thermal in Riverside County, CA. The $275 million Teayawa Energy Center will be located on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians' land through a long-term lease agreement between Calpine and the Torres Martinez. Construction of the project may begin as soon as mid-2001, with commercial operation slated to begin in late 2003. The project will interconnect with an existing transmission line adjacent to the property. As the power project is located on Native American land, the lead permitting agency under the National Environmental Policy Act is the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Additionally, BIA approval is necessary to ensure that the Teayawa Energy Center appropriately meets the cultural, environmental and economic 
Note:  See gas quality section at the bottom that they propose adding on their other pipelines, like they have on NGPL. Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run around FERC's Order 637, filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff procedures to avoid the more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer protests. Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories, Indicated Shippers said. They include imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality, point allocations, curtailment priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental purchase and sale, capacity release, unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous. Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316), saying ""most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI to implement elements of Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity for meaningful review and comment by KMI's customers."" Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and comment on usually routine tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted 30 days for comments on Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to make compliance filings June 15. KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed at changing its tariff to reflect ""the current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.."" It did acknowledge, ""A number of the changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's

New Xcel Energy Combination Completed Just 17 months after announcement of merger plans, Minneapolis-based Northern States Power and Denver-based New Century Energies have cleared the last hurdle to combine under the new name Xcel Energy Inc. The merger creates one of the 10 largest electricity and natural gas companies in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued its approval of the merger, wrapping up approvals from several federal agencies and states where the companies operate. Xcel Energy will serve more than 3 million electricity and 1.5 million natural gas customers in 12 states, and 2 million electricity customers internationally. Company headquarters will be in Minneapolis. Gradually, the NSP and NCE names will be phased out as Xcel Energy provides enhanced products and services in 12 states, including parts of Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, under the symbol XEL. Current New Century Energies shareholders will receive 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy stock for each share of NCE they hold. NSP shareholders will get one for one and will not be required to exchange their existing NSP stock. The merger proposal was announced March 25, 1999, and completed in less than a year and a half. ""This has been an incredibly successful merger process,"" said Jim Howard, Xcel chairman. ""It demonstrates what can be accomplished when regulators, environmentalists, community leaders and the merger partners all work in a common direction --- to create a better utility company for the 
********************************************************************** CERA Alert: Sent Thu, June 15, 2000 ********************************************************************** Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker Author: N. American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Alert Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1230 , Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market, as three factors-increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound-call into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. As strong as gas market fundamentals are, gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years.  In this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer-with pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise-and gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use demand. The $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) increase in gas prices since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users. First, gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the East Coast, and gas will likely lose approximately 600 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer. Second, several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down. Equally telling, however, is that heat in any one region of the country-most recently the West-is all that is required to sustain gas prices above $4.00 at the Henry Hub, despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets. Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive. For these reasons CERA expects prices to average $4.45 at the Henry Hub during July (see Table 1), and even greater volatility is ! possible. The intense competition and need to price out end-use demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above $5.00 per MMBtu amid heat waves this summer. Gas Storage-Injections Increase, but Little Relief Yet The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages, with the American Gas Association (AGA) reporting 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of injections during each of the weeks ending June 2 and 9. However, these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to 400 Bcf on a year-over-year basis, and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks, or even months, to come. As temperatures rise through the end of the month, injections are likely to slow, so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of approximately 10 Bcf per day. The deficit that stood at an estimated 394 Bcf as of the end of May (see Table 2), on an inventory level of approximately 1,454 Bcf, is expected to rise slightly during June, to 403 Bcf, despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month. With US wellhead supply still running an estimated 0.5 to 1.0 Bcf per day below year-earlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting this decline, even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task. Each month in which this 400 Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October. Injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this pattern to reverse in a significant way, an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditions. Regional Markets With the exception of the Rocky Mountains, western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region. This strong demand is pulling supplies from the Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California. Prices at the California border have been particularly strong, averaging over a $0.30 premium to the Henry Hub so far this month. Continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through July, as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines. In addition, the early heat waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus, although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong (see Table 3). CERA's outlook by region follows: *  Rockies. Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region. High utilization rates on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer. CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry Hub of $0.55 per MMBtu. *  San Juan. The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub, and this West Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer. CERA expects a differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of $0.16 per MMBtu during July. *  Permian and Mid-Continent. As Texas power loads increase, the competition from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify. Permian differentials, which have been averaging around $0.15 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub, should narrow. CERA expects a $0.06 per MMBtu differential for July. Mid-Continent supplies should price just below Permian supplies, at an $0.08 per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub. *  Chicago. Chicago differentials continue to trade around $0.05 per MMBtu to the Henry Hub, and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials, ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure. CERA expects a July differential of $0.06 per MMBtu. *  Northeast. New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer, namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of $4.00 gas. The result has been differentials above $0.30 from Transco Station 65 but closer to $0.30 from the Henry Hub. As power generation load reaches its peak, however, differentials can rise even in summer. Short-lived power load peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the $0.40s, but for the month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average $0.34. Canadian Markets-Demand Still Down Canadian demand continues to be down on a year-over-year basis. Volumes on TransCanada Pipeline are 400 MMcf below levels at this time last year, and Alberta demand is 200 MMcf below; both of these reductions are primarily storage related. Weak storage injections, driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summer-winter price spread, continue to place inventories further behind 1999 levels. Although inventories are still well above the five-year average, unless injections increase, it is more likely that end-of-season inventories will be comparable to the five-year average (450 Bcf) rather than to 1999 levels (484 Bcf). Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year. Thus far in June, flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to 1999, while PG&E GT-NW is currently operating 300 MMcf higher. Demand on the West Coast is expected to continue this trend for the summer. Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with 1999 levels. An outage pattern similar to last year's has emerged. TCE/NOVA has had maintenance projects ongoing in June, but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds. Thus far in June, reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as 850 MMcf but should average 300 MMcf for the month. Even though June is expected to be flat year-over-year, the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than 1999 maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred. Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year, largely in the fourth quarter, as a result of the increased level of drilling. The annual average supply is expected to be around 100 MMcf per day higher than in 1999 as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and modest growth in British Columbia (again primarily later in the year), as well as the new production from! Ft. Liard that is now onstream. The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada. AECO is expected to average C$5.15 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.69 per MMBtu) for June with a differential in the low US$0.60s. July is expected to average C$5.44 per GJ (US$3.90 per MMBtu). The Henry-to-AECO differential is likely to remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand.

American Natural Gas Team E-Mail Category: Watch Product Line: North American Gas , URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1235 , Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the development of spot markets. **end** Follow URL for complete report.

Predictions of Fuel Switching 
High Prices Put a Damper on Industrial Demand Gas producers must be wringing their hands in glee as futures prices top $4.45/MMBtu, but some of their customers clearly are a little less than overjoyed. High gas prices are forcing some fertilizer producers to consider shutting down their plants and selling their feedstock on the open market just to make ends meet. WEFA Inc. energy analyst Ron Denhardt estimates the gas industry will lose 25% (400 MMcf/d) of demand from the ammonia and urea industry this year because of the high price of natural gas. Other observers are expecting much larger losses, reaching as high as 1.5 Bcf/d. Denhardt also estimates the loss of an additional 1-2 Bcf/d due to fuel switching in the power production sector and possibly another 2.2 Bcf/d as industrial end users switch over to fuel oil. But those numbers are dependent on the comparative price of Nos. 1 and 2 fuel oil, both of which currently exceed the price of natural gas per Btu. ""Chemical and fertilizer companies who have hedged their gas supplies are better off shutting down their plants right now and selling the gas into the market,"" said one chemical plant supply manager, who asked to remain anonymous. ""It's terrible. It's awful. About 70% of my contracts for sale are pass-through based on the cost of raw materials, and that's the only thing that is keeping me in business right now. We would not be making cost right now otherwise. We might be at a break-even point. And we hedged about 40% of our purchases back in September of last year, which was a pretty good time, looking back right now. We just have to plan it day by day. A number of fertilizer companies have closed 
Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100

Gas Storage and Transportation System 
Note:  I'm sure you have this on your radar screen, but just in case you don't... PG&E Corp. announced that its National Energy Group will develop its first Nevada project, a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired generating plant to be located 45 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The merchant plant's main purpose is to supply Nevada, but when it is not needed there, it will add much-needed supply to the western energy market. The group hopes to begin construction during the fourth quarter of 2001, with completion expected in early 2004. ""Southern Nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the country,"" said Thomas B. King, president of PG&E NEG, West Region. ""Because of its location near Las Vegas, the Meadow Valley project will be ideally positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth."" Including the Nevada project, PG&E National Energy Group has a total of 4,000 MW in development or construction in California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona. 
Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which is in dire need of new power generation. The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer 2003. Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process recently enacted by the California legislature. Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition, construction management and operation of global power production facilities. The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Kenosha Exp, Gulf South's Gulf Pines, CIG's Western Frontier 
Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. ""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004.

UtiliCorp to Re-Acquire and Then Become Aquila UtiliCorp United announced plans to buy back the 20% of its trading and risk management arm, Aquila Inc., that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name. The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes. Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industry's largest trading house, Enron Corp. On this busy Wednesday, UtiliCorp also released its earnings, and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary. 
NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : October 29, 2001 ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001 Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power producers-may have been lulled to sleep. Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a hold on their fuel costs. However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are raring to get what they believe they deserve. One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com. 
Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/ NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week. For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term. FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would ""no longer make available to the public"" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to ""respond timely to legitimate requests"" for such documents. The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
Second CA Merchant Storage Field Pushes Back Opening California's second merchant underground natural gas storage project near Sacramento began injecting supplies this month, but its commercial start-up date has been pushed back to Dec. 1, according to the California operations manager for Houston-based Western Hub Properties LLC, the developer. Although it is not fully subscribed more than half the capacity is under contract, according to Jim Fossum, the in-state manager for Western Hub, which was purchased last summer by a partnership of Aquila Inc and ArcLight Energy Partners Fund in a $220 million deal that is still several months away from approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. The Lodi Storage Project near the town of Lodi, CA, about 35 miles south of the state capital, will have ""high-performance, quick-cycle-capabilities"" in a project that stores 12 Bcf of natural gas with a 500 MMcf/d withdrawal rate and 400 MMcf/d injection rate. Fossum said Western Hub also is pursuing a second merchant storage project in the southern half of the state around Bakersfield in the Wheeler Ridge area close to the nexus of all the major interstate natural gas pipeline coming into California. That project, he said, is not included in the Aquila partnership purchase at this time, and will be developed initial by a still-to-be-named company using some of the same personnel that developed Lodi. 
Initial ALJ Decision in Transwestern Case Delayed FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. has extended by two weeks the deadline for an initial decision in the case in which Transwestern Pipeline is alleged to have arranged more lucrative negotiated-rate deals last winter prior to posting available firm transportation capacity to its web site -- a move that extracted higher rates and limited the capacity availability for recourse-rate shippers for service to California. Due to ""scheduling conflicts,"" Wagner pushed back the deadline for president ALJ Jacob Leventhal to issue a decision to Oct. 30 from Oct. 15.

Transportation Notes El Paso said it has become necessary to shut down Line 1600 upstream of Casa Grande Station one day earlier than previously announced. The line will be down on Nov. 15, instead of Nov. 16. Capacity of the South Mainline will be reduced by 245 MMcf/d effective for Cycle 2 on Nov. 15. The work will be completed prior to the start of the Nov. 16 gas day. El Paso also said Line 1218 downstream of Bondad Station was taken out of service for emergency repairs Wednesday reducing the capacity through Bondad Station by 190 MMcf/d. The reduction was effective for Cycle 4 and will continue through today. Line 1110 between Keystone and Pecos River Stations will be shut in for repairs on Thursday as well, reducing the capacity through Pecos River Station by an additional 40 MMcf/d to 800 MMcf/d capacity. If you have operational or scheduling questions, call your scheduling representative at (719) 520-4706.

Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. ""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
Expansion 
Note:  This quick expansion was the result of FERC's expedited permitting process.  Lorna PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company's ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. ""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group's West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN's mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN's 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. ""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said. 
Note:  Add this to the NOAA and Salomon Smith Barney forecasts.  LB WSI Sees Mild Winter in Northeast, Cold in West In contrast to forecasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Salomon Smith Barney of a colder-than-normal winter in key energy consuming regions, WSI Corp.'s end-of-October update to its seasonal forecast for November, December and January predicts warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and in the central and southern Plains. WSI, however, said it expects cooler-than-normal temperatures in the Gulf Coast states, Northern Plains, Great Lakes states, and all areas west of the Rocky Mountains. 
Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's regulators and Indicated Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three transportation agreements by which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of unsubscribed firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of Transwestern Pipeline and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation capacity to the southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest today. Between the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm capacity from the San Juan and Permian basins to California. For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity represents a worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and Trade, who has held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. ""At least then there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now it's Enron, the

Note:  Let me know if we need to gather more information on these storage initiatives.  I would be happy to research further. Lorna CA Gets 2nd Merchant Storage Project, 3rd on the Way Setting aside vociferous local opposition from nearby property owners and a proposed denial from one of its administrative law judges (ALJ), the California Public Utilities Commission Thursday gave the go-ahead to a proposed $80 million underground natural gas storage field near Lodi in Northern California. Texas-based Western Hub Properties' $80 million Lodi storage project is designed to have 12 Bcf of working capacity, with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacity. It includes a 35-mile transmission pipeline that connects with Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone pipeline. It will be the state's second non-utility storage project, following Wild Goose storage which went into service last year. Approval of the Lodi project is effective in mid-June. While CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said he supports ""letting the market decide"" whether a project should be built and encourages competition in gas storage, he ""cannot support allowing competitors to use regulatory loopholes to take advantage of private property owners. In my view, this case comes precariously close to 
Senate Calls for Hearing into High Gas Prices There appears to be one issue that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill can agree on --- gas prices are too high. Chairman Frank H. Murkowski (R-AK) of the Senate Energy Committee and Ranking Minority Member Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) have called for an oversight hearing to look into rising natural gas prices. The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 12 in Senate Dirksen 366. Appearing before the committee will be representatives of the gas industry and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. ""Spot prices for natural gas on Dec. 6 hit $9.54/MMBtu. That compares to a price a year ago of about $2.16/Btu,"" said Murkowski. ""We are concerned about

Power supply shortages and threats of system blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California, and spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy headache for the West. Gas prices along the Pacific corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the South have jumped to over $40.00 per MMBtu during December after averaging over $15.00 per MMBtu through the second half of November. Extreme weather, strong power demand for gas, and unusually low gas storage levels have combined to intensify the demand for pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor. 
Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to markets in New Jersey and New York. Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered by the original certificate. The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The $80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines currently are running full.

Kenosha Exp, Gulf South's Gulf Pines, CIG's Western Frontier 
Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term. FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would ""no longer make available to the public"" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to ""respond timely to legitimate requests"" for such documents. The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
California Markets Named Westpath Expansion 
Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
FERC Approves North Baja Pipe The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
Executive News: PNM terminates merger with Western Resources Albuquerque, N.M.-based PNM Resources announced Tuesday its board had officially killed the proposed deal to buy Western Resources' electric utility subsidiaries. The deal, originally valued at over $4 billion, had been in trouble for months, and each side sued the other in state court in New York. PNM said the merger could be terminated after Dec. 31 under the terms of the deal, if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards completing the transaction. But Western has disputed that PNM had grounds to back out of the deal. PNM sued Western in October seeking to get out of the deal alleging breach of contract, in part because of adverse rulings from the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) on rates and a Western restructuring plan considered vital to the transaction. Western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later, seeking at least $650 million in damages against PNM for alleged extortion, breach of contract, sabotage and improper interference in the KCC proceedings. Neither case has been decided, although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Western's case or delay action on it until after it has decided PNM's initial suit. Western also has appealed the KCC order blocking a planned restructuring in preparation for the PNM transaction to a Kansas district court.

Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001 Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power producers-may have been lulled to sleep. Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a hold on their fuel costs. However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are raring to get what they believe they deserve. One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com. 
Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/ NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week. For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience.

Monthly Briefing 
Gas Storage and Transportation System 
Wood Signals That El Paso's FR Contracts Are High on Agenda FERC denied rehearing of a June order that permits Arizona Public Service Co. to assign its full-requirements (FR) capacity contract on El Paso Natural Gas to affiliate Pinnacle West Energy to serve a new gas-fired generation facility that it is building in Arizona. On the surface, it seemed a clear victory for the companies involved. However, Chairman Pat Wood made it very clear that he has concerns about FR service on El Paso, which entitles customers to unlimited capacity at frozen rates, and that he plans to take up the issue at a later date. ""I will reluctantly go along with the order denying rehearing, but [I] look forward very aggressively to a forum in which we can address the capacity concerns"" on El Paso, Wood said Wednesday during a marathon Commission meeting, the first over which he presided [CP01-90, RP00-336]. The proper forum for discussion of the FR service will be El Paso's Order 637 proceeding, he noted.

New Peaking Rate for SoCalGas Could Spur Bypass 
NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : October 29, 2001 ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
Pipe Expansions Planned for Rockies Region With several pipeline companies well into addressing the pipeline capacity shortages that persist as natural gas production grows throughout the Rocky Mountain region, Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission LLC (KMIGT) announced two major projects Wednesday, and several other companies detailed expansions planned or in the works during the closing session at the 13th Annual Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Strategy Conference. Headlining the news was KMIGT's plans to use existing rights-of-way to build the Advantage Pipeline, which would fill the same needs as the Colorado Interstate Gas pipe, moving from the Cheyenne Hub to the Mid-Continent. An open season is scheduled on the proposed pipe this fall. Dave Scharf, business development director for KMIGT, said the 24-inch pipe, which would move gas primarily from the Powder River Basin, would have a capacity of 330 MMcf/d, delivering to interconnects on its way to the Kansas City markets. ""It would have a smaller size, with about 40% less content,"" Scharf said, but it would be expandable to 450 MMcf/d, with access to liquid Mid-Continent pipes, local distribution centers and end-use markets. A smaller pipeline, NECO -- a 12-inch pipe, about 95 miles long -- would serve the northeastern Colorado market. Although small, Scharf emphasized that it would reduce some of the bottlenecks now evident in moving gas in that part of the state, and would also allow backhauls to Cheyenne. An open season on this line is also scheduled this fall, Scharf said. KMIGT also is planning to expand its storage capacity in the Rockies, adding more horsepower at the Cheyenne Hub and Huntsman facility. The Huntsman would be expanded to deliver 75 MMcf/d, with delivery at Cheyenne of 45 MMcf/d. ""We want to customize shippers' needs,"" Scharf said of the expansion. Noting there were synergies between the three projects, he said KMIGT was on a growth plan that would use both acquisitions and expansion. ""Rocky Mountain growth opportunities we see are in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska,"" he said. El Paso's Craig Coombs, who directs project development for the company's Western Pipeline Group, said El Paso also is expanding its pipelines east from the Rockies, with a Cheyenne to Mid-Continent connection, spending $380 million to add 540 MDth/d. The open season for this expansion ended July 20, said Coombs, and he said El Paso is now negotiating with shippers. A FERC filing is scheduled for December 2001, with an in-service date in late 2003 or early 2004. Coombs also updated attendees on the CIG expansion along the Front Range of the Rockies, which he said is on track to be in service by mid-2004. Over the next four years, Coombs said supply from the Rockies would grow from 5 Bcf/d to 7.5 Bcf/d, and warned there would be ""blood on the streets"" if pipeline systems are not expanded. Coombs said El Paso planned to file its request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January 2002 for its Ruby pipeline, which is scheduled to carry 250 MDth/d from the Rockies into Nevada and 500 MDth/d into California. The Ruby project, said Coombs, ""is designed with power plants in mind."" The pipeline will be 30-36-inches with 40,000 horsepower. El Paso's Western Frontier pipeline project, which also closed its open season in July, is also is on schedule, with a FERC filing by the fourth quarter of this year and an in-service target date by November 2003. ""What's driving all of these expansions are the power plant projects,"" Coombs said. With more than 9,200 MW proposed in the region in the coming years, he said capacity would rise more than 2 Bcf/d by 2010. Noting that every planned expansion might not come to fruition because of competing proposals, Coombs said that there is ""still tremendous growth"" in the Rockies. Shelley Wright, supervisor of capacity marketing for Questar Pipeline Co., detailed the many projects her company has under way in the Rockies, including its Main Line 104, the Clay Basin Projects, the Southern Trails pipe to California and its work on the Eakin compressors. The Main Line 104, a joint venture with El Paso's CIG, will move new and existing gas supplies to the Wasatch Front and other connecting pipes. It is expected to be in service in November 2001, and is on schedule and moving forward, Wright said. She also noted that the Clay Basin, which is the largest storage facility in the western United States, was already ahead of schedule for 2001-2002 storage. ""We're seeing more interest in getting storage filled this year"" than last, Wright said, noting that storage was depleted last winter. The Clay Basin facility will undergo testing tentatively in April 2002, which ""may result in additional firm capacity."" Wright said there had been ""a lot of interest in additional storage capacity,"" and Questar will know more next year as to whether it will expand the facility. 
Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
I didn't realize the report that I sent out yesterday about the California Energy Commission's conclusions on the state's natural gas infrastructure was so long!  Here is a brief synopsis.  I hope this helps everyone.  I haven't had time to read the full report yet, but if I see a better summary come out, I'll send it to you as well. Lorna CEC Blames Overtaxed In-State Gas System for High Prices Confirming what the state's energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago, the California Energy Commission (CEC) staff last week released its final draft report on the state's natural gas infrastructure, concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher-than-average wholesale gas prices, particularly in the southern half of the state. But the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit. It concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in California. ""Market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks, but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in California,"" the report stated. Among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers, said the CEC report, which will go to the five-member commission for approval Aug. 22. It stressed encouraging the development of more ""independent"" gas storage facilities, and taking steps to more fully ""optimize"" storage, including an increase in its use by large end-users. As a backdrop to the study's conclusions, the CEC report noted that both upgrades of in-state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet ""growing demand in California and throughout the West."" If the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don't come online as scheduled, the CEC report said other state actions would be necessary, although it did not spell out what those might be. For the future, the report said that the CEC will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are ""key indicators"" of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state's natural gas infrastructure. The other steps recommended for action are: 1) encouraging more in-state natural gas production (the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives); 2) setting new ""design criteria and reliability standards"" for the state's gas system to reflect what the CEC calls ""the changing nature of natural gas demand, especially for electric generators;"" 3) establishing integrated planning of the state's pipeline and storage facilities; and 4) developing a ""natural gas curtailment scheme"" emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages. The 111-page report, ""Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues,"" prepared by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee for final adoption of the five-member politically appointed commission, assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply, pipeline capacity (both inter- and intrastate) and storage, with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the Pacific Northwest and the in-state pipeline constraints at the California-Arizona border. As part of the proposed implementation, the report recommends that the CEC work more closely with the California Public Utilities Commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is ""fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas"" during shortage periods. It also proposes that the CEC this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non-core, large energy-intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage. 
Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates. Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered ""moot"" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. ""Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before"" capacity became available, ""it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted"" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were ""null and void."" The only ""relevant"" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. Richardson and Sempra ""clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted,"" Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies ""had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra,"" she noted. Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, ""Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates,"" Miller testified. 
NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : November 13, 2001 Watson: Enron Upside 'Clearly Worth Doing the Deal' 
State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project.

Kenosha Exp, Gulf South's Gulf Pines, CIG's Western Frontier 
Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
