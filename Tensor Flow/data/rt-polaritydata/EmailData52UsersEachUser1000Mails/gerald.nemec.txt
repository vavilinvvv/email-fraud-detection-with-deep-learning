Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming it is our standard form.  I will check this. Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that this goes to Entex first complicates the issue. Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if it ultimately ended up at state facilities? Lauri A Allen 12/19/2000 10:57 AM 
I haven't heard anything back from you guys on this.  Any insight?  I know Linda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtus which could mean incremental volumes that TGLO would be trying to get into Midcon. 
Dan,  Any input you have on this contract would be appreciated. 
Gerald/Eric- I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference? I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily? Thanks for your help.

Dan,  The only other thing I can think of is taking a security interest in the assets we are financing, if we are concerned about these guys being a credit risk.  We did this with the MTG deal.  I have a form of mortgage agreement which works with this type of deal.  I would guess credit needs to make that call.  Let me know if you want the form. Enron North America Corp. 
Dan,  Attached is the form.  It references the agreement we are lending the money under (and Events of Default thereunder) and also needs to have exhibits prepared.  We probably also should check to see if there are any existing Security Interest in these assets.  The ones we know that we are subordinate to should be noted in the mortgage.  Shonnie has a contact in Wyoming she has used before to search the county records for any existing security interest.

Here is the latest. 
Please disregard the prior version. 
Attached is the amendment to the Kennedy Agreement reflected the repricing.  Please review and let's talk in the morning. 
Ruth,  Attached is a redline and clean version of the amendment.  I added the language we discussed on the phone.  I also added paragraph and associated changes to make it clear that this pricing doesn't comment until December 1, 2001. 
Ken,  Please review the attached. 
Trevor,  I created an amendment to the Energy Services Agreement based on Paul's letter of April 19.  I think that this amendment is a much cleaner way to revised the Schedules to the Agreement.  Please review the amendment and schedules.  I revised the schedules further to make the base line calculations clearer.  If OK, lets fax a copy to Paul for his review before I prepare executables.  Let me know if you have any questions. Note:  We will also need to have a declaration of HPL and Managing Partner of HCC to review and approve this amendment.  Kevin Howard can sign and I have

Joan,  The contract states that Wildhorse only has to accept gas from Crescendo that the downstream carriers will accept.  Per Brett Frie at Enogex, the Entrada production is 24% Nitrogen.  Until the plant is up and running, this gas will not meet any of the downstream carriers specs.  I am not sure how we get the Nitrogen out of the gas stream without the plant? The Dakota production was not mentioned in the letter, because I have no facts about the gas quality of this gas.  You had forwarded emails last week indicating the Dan Reineke was to take samples at the wellhead and downstream of Wildhorse's plant.  Once we have these facts we can send a letter concerning the Dakota.  Do you have any info on these samples? Joan Quick 07/24/2000 07:17 PM 
Per the drafts, we are asking ""Wildhorse to accept all gas delivered.... upon startup of the Treating Plant.""   I thought the purpose of this letter was to get Wildhorse to take all of our gas right now, not just after the plant is started up.  Is this not so?   I agree with Dan, that  this letter only discusses the Entrada gas, with no mention of the Dakota curtailment, which I think it should. I had just a couple minor changes... 
Gerald -- I have provided a few coments (redlined) to your draft letter attached below. However, I wanted to offer the following ideas for discussion with you and the others listed above as to potential inclusion in the Wildhorse letter: A.  Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the shut-in status of Entrada production?  Should we request written notification related to the recent curtailment of Dakota production?  [As we've discussed, Enogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse, so we do not have any historic documentation of Wildhorse's claims]. B.  Should we identify (potential) contractual issues due to the curtailment of Dakota production; e.g.  Sec. 6 detailing the (wellhead) delivery pressure requirements under this contract, et al?  [As we've discussed, the system pressures have increased due to (initially) gas being re-routed by Wildhorse over the past two years which has loaded the San Arroyo system, and now the NWPL quality issues and subsequent Wildhorse curtailments has increased pressures system-wide.  If Wildhorse based their ability to allow these problems to persist by referring to Sec. 7 ""Gas Quality"" of the agreement, what remedies can we request....partial release of Dakota gas?]. Here's the frustration, based on conversations with producers in the area and the documents we've received from Enogex, Wildhorse has continued to attach non-pipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to increase gathering revenues, yet has not invested any $$$ for processing of this gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines.  Then, they use the downstream pipes as the reason for shutting in all their captive producers, and have thus far offered no solutions to the system pressure and quality issues discussed above.  Therefore, its critical that this letter gets to the ""right"" people within Wildhorse and, if possible, make reference to some element of timing (e.g., reasonable dispatch, commercially reasonable manner, etc.). Thanks. Dan

Hi.  Recovery is taking longer than I thought.  I've read all my mail, and washed all my clothes but I still owe quite a few people phone calls (long distance friends who called while I was away).  I was able to get some stuff done at work on Sunday but probably need to come in again this weekend.  I just feel unmotivated -- so need to hit the gym next week and will probably feel a lot  better. Lunch tomorrow sounds good -- noon downstairs? Are you still working on Colorado stuff or is something else keeping you busy? Gerald Nemec@ECT 07/26/2000 10:45 AM

My thought is just to take all this language out and solely leave us on out if we don't get the transport for any reason under the terms of the Precedent Agreement.  Counterparty might not go for it, but it would clear this issue up. Barbara N Gray 07/26/2000 06:45 PM 
gerald,what do you think ""reasonable efforts to acquire"" means?  do we have to elect to take transport....at what price........since producer must pay the price under the contract price formula....we may need to be willing to agree on a range of acceptable prices...........this would also help define reasonale efforts...........................your thoughts please   bng

Heinifer, A few corrections:  Jeff and Cathy call each other ""boo"" not ""pooh"". Secondly, with your threats of my arse being kicked, I must say that violence solves nothing, but if you wanna dance tonight, bring it on.  Third, it is not a ""supposed"" conference call just because you didn't plan it or have the idea, IT IS A GO!  Fourthly, & oh yes Fourthly is a word, anyone who wants to can ""present""  their ideas & suggestions  (or demands if your a Nazi) on the conference call.

Concord goes down. It'll be too cold and I'll complain about being cold the whole time. Plus, it's not as interesting as Spain. Matt, you could wear cute little bullfighter pants, with knee-high white socks and a sexy beret atop your noggin. The hot-blooded, salsa-dancin', dark skinned, beautiful spanish maidens will be falling all over you. You don't want frompy, belching, stinky armpit German women chasing you around, do you? Or, do you? Eric, to your little Illinois/Nazis comment below that you didn't copy me on, well...You suck! And you'll pay later for that, dear.

Dear U2 Fan, We're in Dublin finishing the new album. It will be released at the end of October. In the meantime, keep your eye on the Green Room you may be the first to hear music from the new album. See you soon. ----------------------------------- Take care Adam, Larry, Bono & Edge 
Attached is the final version of the CSA.  Let me know if you need an executed hard copy. 
Ken,  Attached is a revised draft of the Hanover Agreement based on all our discussions to date.  Please review.  I would prefer one more internal review prior to forwarding to Hanover.  Please note where information is still needed concerning the specific units for the schedule forms.  Sorry for the delay. 
Attached are the latest changes to the docs redlined against the originals docs, per your voicemail. Chris,  I made one slight change from the versions I had sent to you earlier.  In the Capacity Allocation agreement signature block, I am now having ENA sign for section 4.5 as well. Let me know if you need anything else. 
Ken,  Attached is the letter.  Please sign and forward the original to Kent Harris via Fedex.  We should request a signature acceptance of the letter and a confirmation receipt of such signature acceptance for our files. The letter has a header for Crescendo on it.  Not sure if you had stationary for Crescendo yet. Send a signed copy to me  and I will copy all the Enron CCs. Gerald Nemec EB3883 1400 Smith St. Houston, Tx 77002 cc Carter Mathies, Don Opersteny, and Steve Huckaby to the same address as Kent Harris cc Tom Dyk and Pete Scherer at Tom Brown 555 17th St., Suite 1850 Denver, CO 80202 Let me know if you have any questions and thanks for all your help. 
Carol,  Attached is the revised letter.  Per the voicemail I left last week, please let me know if there are any issues with us stating the prepay in this letter.  Also when is TW expecting the payment to be wired.  Need that date. 
FYI,  Attached is the final version of the letter that was sent to Wildhorse. 
Gerald, Attached is the revised letter that I am sending to Wildhorse. Ken 
Attached is the latest set of documents which have minor revisions based on my discussions with Chris last week.  These have been only redlined against the prior version, not the original versions.  Let me know if you want redlines against the original docs.  The LLC was not included as no changes were made from the versions already forwarded. With respect to the cash out imbalance procedures. The Administrative Services Agreement (Exhibit B) currently has a rough procedure for such cashout.  It is also written such that the Members can adopt a new procedure at any time.  If the current procedures are not sufficient, it probably make the most sense to have only a working draft (approved by the members) of procedures in place until we have a few month of operations under our belt to work out the bugs.  Scott Sitter will be developing this draft.  The development of these procedures can be done outside these current revisions. A final imbalance procedure would be adopted by written action of the members upon development of those final procedures. Let me know if you have any questions.

Please send me any dates you plan to be out of the office during the Month of August. 
Arvel,  I received your pressure data.  Unfortunately the contract pressure is assessed against the 3 year period prior to the Effective Date of the contract which is Oct. 19, 1993.  Any chance we would have any such data? Ken Krisa is also checking to see if he has any such data. Also, did we receive any quality information on Dakota production?  Thanks 
Ken,  Wanted to check and see if you guys were able to find any pressure data on Wildhorse for the period of 3 years prior to the Effective Date of the Gathering Agreement?  I think Jim was going to look and see if he had any 
Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined versions incorporating the modified suggested Kennedy revisions we discussed.  Please review.  I will revised the Independant contracts later this afternoon.  I will also send you a form purchase and sale agreement for the Independant gathering facilities. G$ 
Attached is the letter.  I am forwarding per Mark's request.  Let me know if you have any comments.  If everything looks good, let me know and I will create executables.  Thanks.

Confidential Work Product - Attorney Client Privilege Dan,  Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution.  As the situation stands now, Wildhorse's possible responses to the letter are as follows: 1.  Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment. If they do so, then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to Crescendo, one of which is release of the gas.  You are right, there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives. That is a risk I pointed out early.  However, in our letter to Wildhorse, I proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of 2 weeks.  If Wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice: A.  Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the contract.  This will take time.  Depending on court docket loads, 6 months to 1 year. B.  Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in   good faith and we consider the gas released (contract breached by Wildhorse) and that we will build our own system.  Then Crescendo would   build its own system and risk a suit by Wildhorse. 2.  Not declare Unprofitability If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms.  The only complication is that under the contract, Wildhorse's obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream.  Depending on Wildhorse's flow dynamics and our plant placement, Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas.  After your field meeting and our engineering assessment, hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation.  If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant. If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal, I would very directly ask them ""under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees?"".  They don't have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability. Dan J Bump@ENRON 08/01/2000 05:23 PM 
I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today.  I met with the Business Development Director, Bob Mustard. 1)  Tom Brown (as 45% owner of Wildhorse) is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up with solutions to the production problems (quality, pressure, et al) currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin. 2)  Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo (and other producers) low Btu gas; they see these as a new business opportunity for Wildhorse. 3)  Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the Rockies, therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development ventures with Crescendo.  Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very familiar with the nitrogen treating technology.  (I passed all this info on to Ken/Jim). 4)  Here's the interesting part...Bob discussed (confidentially) that for the past 6-8 monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buy-out of Kinder Morgan's interest in Wildhorse (they have a right-to-match provision in their LLC agreement).  The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now being negotiated by the very top mgmt (Kinder & Evans).  If they are successful, (which he thinks TBI will be), then TBI will turn-around and look to spin off the non-strategic systems (like the Piceance Basin assets) to third party purchasers. This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard to our negotiations with Wildhorse..............Wildhorse has been slow-playing negotiations since I first met with them in late May and #4 above may be the reason why.  Now that we've sent the letter recently to Wildhorse requesting (essentially) to clarify their understanding / status of the contracts so we can get to work, my feeling (based on the transaction between KMI & TBI) is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their transaction with TBI is complete, (how much longer will this take?).  Of course, if the transaction is completed, TBI has already made it clear they would like to sell this system, so even if ENA is interested, will TBI negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the system is divested? The point is this......I'm anticipating a generic, non-commital response to Crescendo's letter from Wildhorse.  Although I realize there are no time deadlines in the contract, could you suggest anything we can submit in writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out? I'm off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse.  I'll keep you informed of any developments. Thanks. Dan 
Chris,  The Amended Firm Gathering Agreements were executed back around July 1.  Lori should have copies of the executed documents.

The only complication is that under the contract, Wildhorse's obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream.  Depending on Wildhorse's flow dynamics and our plant placement, Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas.  After your field meeting and our engineering assessment, hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation.  If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant. If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal, I would very directly ask them ""under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees?"". They don't have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability. |--------+-----------------------> |        |          Dan J        | |        |          Bump@ENRON   | |        |                       | |        |          08/01/2000   | |        |          05:23 PM     | |        |                       | |--------+-----------------------> >--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -| | | 
| >--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -| I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today.  I met with the Business Development Director, Bob Mustard. 1)  Tom Brown (as 45% owner of Wildhorse) is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up with solutions to the production problems (quality, pressure, et al) currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin. 2)  Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo (and other producers) low Btu gas; they see these as a new business opportunity for Wildhorse. 3)  Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the Rockies, therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development ventures with Crescendo.  Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very familiar with the nitrogen treating technology.  (I passed all this info on to Ken/Jim). 4)  Here's the interesting part...Bob discussed (confidentially) that for the past 6-8 monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buy-out of Kinder Morgan's interest in Wildhorse (they have a right-to-match provision in their LLC agreement).  The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now being negotiated by the very top mgmt (Kinder & Evans).  If they are successful, (which he thinks TBI will be), then TBI will turn-around and look to spin off the non-strategic systems (like the Piceance Basin assets) to third party purchasers. This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard to our negotiations with Wildhorse..............Wildhorse has been slow-playing negotiations since I first met with them in late May and #4 above may be the reason why.  Now that we've sent the letter recently to Wildhorse requesting (essentially) to clarify their understanding / status of the contracts so we can get to work, my feeling (based on the transaction between KMI & TBI) is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their transaction with TBI is complete, (how much longer will this take?).  Of course, if the transaction is completed, TBI has already made it clear they would like to sell this system, so even if ENA is interested, will TBI negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the system is divested? The point is this......I'm anticipating a generic, non-commital response to Crescendo's letter from Wildhorse.  Although I realize there are no time deadlines in the contract, could you suggest anything we can submit in writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out? I'm off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse.  I'll keep you informed of any developments. Thanks. Dan

Dan,  Attached are the Field Services and Purchase Agreement with the changes we discussed.  As we further discussed, there will be a letter agreement between Independent and Neidigger (??) which gives independent the right to produce and market his gas in accordance with the terms of the attached agreements.  Do you have Niedigger real name and type of entity? 
Attached is the agreement for printing on NBILP Letterhead.   The date is the same as the original CA.   Let me know if you have any questions.  If we could get this signed and faxed back today or first thing Monday that would be great.  Sorry about the delay.  My fax # is (713) 646-3490. 
Let's keep the date.  This way the bi-lateral obligations between the parties are concurrent.  Thanks. Eva Neufeld@ENRON 08/04/2000 04:11 PM 
Gerald, Did you want to keep the April 19 date? Jerry Peters left the office so I'll get this to you Monday a.m.  Let me know if you want me to change the date. Thanks again. Eva

Please plan to attend a meeting regarding EOL Int. Transportation Friday, August 11th 3:00 - 4:00 EB3125A Thanks, Laura Harder 
FYI 
Gerald, here are some things to think about before our meeting.  EDG HPL's intent for initiating EOL service: Sell interruptible transport in stated volume increments Develop daily, weekly and monthly markets in transport that parallel the Texas desk business (price the transportation service required to supply a peaking deal or a week day only deal.) Proposed EOL language by Steve Hotte with Northern's IT group. He is the lead on this project from an EOL perspective A transaction under which the specified Enron natural gas pipeline will transport, on an interruptible basis, a maximum daily volume (stated in MMBtu per day) equal to the volume identified on the website.  The gas will be transported from the specified receipt point(s) to the specified delivery point(s).  The bid and offer rates are stated as one-part rates in $(US) per MMBtu.  If a transaction is consummated, the shipper will be billed the one-part rate, which is inclusive of all applicable surcharges, based on usage.  In addition, the shipper will be billed the applicable charge for fuel.  The term of the transaction will correspond to the dates shown on the website. Additional considerations for HPL's participation, EOL language and GTC (?) language. HPL needs a two part rate, the first part to be billed regardless of use (a demand charge).   Colleen suggested a very small charge ($.0025/MMBtu) to keep counterparties from buying capacity and leaving us high and dry.  The second part is the total rate less the demand charge that will be billed on a commodity basis.  The rate billed will never be larger than the rate transacted on EOL. HPL will not have a bid at this time.  Theoretically, HPL owns all the interruptible transportation capacity and it would be purchasing capcity from itself.  In short, HPL will not be showing bids. Points will really be market zones with well defined pipeline points within them.  Bouncing between points (as capacity at each point allows) will be permitted as long as the shipper continues to utilize the path purchased. The transaction is good for the time purchased, if there is a break in the shipper's use during the transaction, the capcity must be renegotiated, in any event the demand charge will be billed for the full term of the 
There have been many inquiries about Gabrielle, so I thought I would give everybody an update.  Unfortunately, the prognosis is not good.  She has had many complications since the surgery (chest fluid, blood clots, infections, and fluctuating blood pressure due to high blood acidity).  For the past 24 hours, she has been relatively stable, but no improvements.  She is still in ICU and it could still go either way. When Jim's 2 1/2 year old son, Connor, visited Gabrielle on Monday, he looked at Jim and said ""Gabrielle wants to go home.""  Please keep her in your prayers. Thank you, Dina 
Paul,  Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review. 
Attached is a rough draft of the agreement we discussed last week.  Please review and let's discuss. 
Ken, Attached is a redline that might make your review easier.  I didn't want to forward this one to Hanover.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
Attached is a redline with the changes we discussed.  Please review and if it looks OK, please forward to Susan and Dave. 
Mark,  Attached is their proposed language. 
Gerald, I received your voice-mail regarding the LOU. Paul Miller requested that I add some definition to the term ""I-80 corridor"".  The following is my language for that.

Thanks. Please call me at (713) 220-4427 if you have any questions. Sean 
The latest and greatest including form of construction agreement. 
Mark,  Please review and lets discuss. 
How is it going?  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  It has been pretty busy around here.  Trying to sell all these nasty assets.  I am leaving for your homeland, Denver to experience the Rocky Mountain high for myself.  Just what 
Lillie,  You might try checking with Jack Simunek.  I am not sure there is any documentation on this, but he has a pretty good handle on this issue. Jim Coffey at one time issued a one page memo on just this subject.  Might also check with him.  Once we decide whether to apply this or not, putting this into a contract is a relatively simple matter. Lillie Pittman 08/04/99 05:54 PM 
Gerald, Do you have any information on the tax gross up percentage for HPL.?  Also, is there an established policy for applying gross up to reimbursable projects? I have not seen any contract language for HPL projects  that address gross up as part of the producer's cost.  I have, however, occasionally seen gross up included on the work order estimate. If you have any documentation, would you please forward to me. 
Hi Emmye,  Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  It has been extremely busy here at work and I am leaving for Denver today at 5:30 so I am really having to hustle to get things done before I leave.  How was the wedding?  I know you really were just looking for any excuse to go to Tomball. I too had fun on Thursday.  I will give you a call when I get back from Denver. I will be back on Sunday.  Take care and talk to you soon. 
Mark,  Attached are the latest revisions to the participation language. Please review and if everything looks acceptable, forward to NBP. 
I will be attending. Kim Zachary 05/14/99 08:43 AM 
Please be sure to RSVP to me via e-mail on whether or not you will be able to attend their baby shower.  I am ordering lunch and I need an accurate count. It will be on Thursday, May 27th from 11:30-1:00pm in EB 49C4.  Thanks. Kim 
Any chance they could email electronic version of this Agreement? Mark Knippa 08/05/99 10:17 AM 
Gerald, I am sending up a copy of the proposed contract structure from Continental Divide who is the local power utility associated with the Transwestern Gallup station. Overall the commercial terms seem to be in line with all the discussions that have been referenced, although there are some issues we want to make vary clear or more apparent. 
Chris,  Attached is the revised Work Offer.  Please forward to Hanover for execution. 
Made a few slight changes to correct company's name. 
Since Eric is a contract employee, he was not included as part of the formal PRC process recently completed.  Therefore we would like to receive feedback from you concerning Eric's performance outside the performance management system.  I will be forwarding a hard copy Performance Evaluation form for your input.  You may either hand write or email the information back to me. Whichever is easier for you.  Please take time out of your busy schedules to complete the forms as soon as possible.  I would like to have a response by 
Attached is LOI with our revisions redlined.  Please review and call either Mark or myself to discuss. 
Here it is. 
Paul,  Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review. 
Dan,  Attached are the lastest turns of Kennedy.  Let me know if you or Kennedy have questions. 
Jessica,  Attached are the Agreement for both Suzanne and Diane.  The form also refers to a Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement that both Suzanne and Diane must execute.  I have a call in to Michelle about those forms.  I will forward as soon as I get them.  We can go ahead though and forward these agreements to MTM. 
Lisa,    It is extremely hard to watch you struggle through this.  It is hard for me also.  I sit up here trying to work when the reality of our current situation weighs on me like a ton of bricks.   It is hard for me not to break down a couple of times a day, but the pace of my work usually forces me through those times. I don't know if my calling you, asking you to lunch, or holding your hand, helps or hurts at this time.  But I am not going to let us give up on each other.  My feelings for you run too deep to just try and bury them so that I don't have to think about all the pain. We are both struggling to find a place to start.  I want to start by just letting you know that not a day goes by without me thinking of a time when we can put this behind us.  I am not sure how to get there right now either. However, during those few precious time lately when I get to look into your eyes, I see the true Lisa (changed as she is by the last couple of years), but still Lisa nonetheless.  I need to get to know this changed true Lisa, whatever happens in the near future. I felt I just to had to write this email. 
Attached for your review is a draft of the Lost Creek - ENA IT Agreement. Please review and let me know if you have any comments or questions.  Some provision (nominations, imbalances)  are taken from the North Central Agreement since BR is familiar with that form. 
Eric, Need your help on this.  Let's get a copy of the grazing lease that Candy is referring to in the E-mail.  I am not clear on what she means by having Merl operate the well.  I think she means allow him to graze this area under the terms of his existing lease, but I am not sure.  Can you get with Candy on this?  Thanks. 
Nathan tells me that he has a request in to you for a dollar evaluation of the Hamill Gas Unit #1 water well that EOG recently assigned and conveyed over to HPL at my request.  Please advise me at your earliest convenience what that value may be so that we can appropriately get it on our asset ledger.  I am also awaiting a response from John Towles as to a clearer plat on this property as was originally requested by EOG some time ago which I assume we will use as an exhibit to the Operating Agreement.. Also, by copy hereof, I ask that Gerald or his designee prepare an Operating Agreement between HPL and Merl Vanek whereby Merl will be entitled to operate this well for purposes of his grazing lease at this facility.  HPL desires that Merl operate this well at his sole cost and expense and maintain it in good working order.  We can make the term of this Operating Agreement coterminous with his grazing lease which is established under an October 1, 1998 Grazing Lease with an original term of one year from that date and year-to-year thereafter unless sooner terminated by at least 90 days' advance written notice prior to the end of the original term or any renewal term thereafter by one party to the other.  Merl's address is 2634 Milroy Lane, Houston, TX  77088 with a phone number of 281-444-8689 and a fax number of 281-587-4200.  I have already advised Merl of the effective ownership of this well by HPL and he will be operating it accordingly as his need to do so is urgent, so I request that this document be prepared as soon as possible in consideration of HPL's liability. 
Jessica,  Attached are the Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreements. There is one for Suzanne Badeaux, Diane Allen, and MTM Temps.   Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. 
Susan, Under the terms of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement, ECS is working with the electric utility (Tri-State) to provide TW access to Tri-State's web site for the purposes of load controlling the Gallup Station to avoid Tri-State's system peaks.  Attached is a confidentiality agreement which Tri-State drafted under which Tri-State will allow both TW and ECC to see such data.  Tri-State is obviously concerned with migration of the data to Enron's power trading groups.  The attached draft includes my comments.  I have attached a clean and a redlined of my comments.  I thought we could get both of our comments prior to sending back to Tri-State.  Please review and return all your comments to me.  Thanks. 
Brian,  Attached is a draft of the termination letter.  The letter assumes the letter agreement was executed.  There also appears to be an agency agreement which appointed Merrick as agent for ROW acquisition.  This is also terminated by the letter.  I haven't heard from Shonnie yet.  Please review and add any comments you have.  Thanks

Shonnie, I have extracted all the reps from the PSA which refer to the Gathering Companies and attached.  To summarize they are as follows: 1.  Compliance with Laws: Permits (In compliance with all Legal Requirements) 2.  Condition of Property 3.  Litigation 4.  Taxes 5.  Environmental Compliance. (In compliance with all Environmental Laws) Let me know if we need to review these with Lost Creek and Fort Union counsel. 
G,  How is it going?  Been a while since we spoke.  What have you been up to? As for me, just a lot of work and little vacation worked in there.  Nothing real exciting.  Finally finished the redo of that damn kitchen.  I don't think I will be undertaking any home repair projects on my own anytime soon. I am having Austin withdrawals and need to get back real soon.  It won't be long now though for football.  Sounds like Redding and Sims look pretty good in practices so far.  That first game makes me nervous.  NC State is a pretty good passing team and we may have freshman cornerbacks starting. Now for the real subject.  Tailgating.  How is it shaping up this year?  Same place, cold beer, good food.  I am definitely coming in for the NC State game.  Lisa may or may not be with me.  Don't know yet.  Anyway I will be glad to contribute to the cause. 
Bob,  Can you take care of this?  Thanks.

Susan, Under the terms of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement, ECS is working with the electric utility (Tri-State) to provide TW access to Tri-State's web site for the purposes of load controlling the Gallup Station to avoid Tri-State's system peaks.  Attached is a confidentiality agreement which Tri-State drafted under which Tri-State will allow both TW and ECC to see such data.  Tri-State is obviously concerned with migration of the data to Enron's power trading groups.  The attached draft includes my comments.  I have attached a clean and a redlined of my comments.  I thought we could get both of our comments prior to sending back to Tri-State.  Please review and return all your comments to me.  Thanks.

Gerald, I contacted Sandra Grimes and John Lopez, Manager of Logistics, of Oasis Pipe Line Company and informed them that the contracts should remain with Enron North America Corp. However, they have asked for an agreement or letter to disregard the assignment and assumption agreement effective September 1, 2000.  They would like to have this agreement or letter ASAP. I will fax it to:  Atten:  Sandra Grimes Fax:  (713)  758-9835 I can forward the original to Oasis Pipe Line Company on Tuesday, 9/5/2000. Let me know when the agreement or letter is ready and I will route it for signatures, accordingly.  If it cannot be ready today, I will contact Sandra Grimes and John Lopez and inform them that it will be ready on Tuesday, 9/5/2000. Marlene Hilliard 
The Oasis Pipeline Contracts are still being routed for signature.  However, I received this e-mail from Stacey Neuweiler to continue business as ENA not HPLC. Thank You. Marlene Hilliard 
Per Tom Martin's request, please continue business as ENA, not HPLC for September 1,2000.  Until we know the future of Houston Pipeline, we will continue transacting as ENA.  Thank you very much for all of your help with this. Stacey Neuweiler 713-853-3952

Ken has faxed me a copy of Exhibit ""A"" - San Arroyo properties encumbered by the Gathering Agreement.  I was hoping that maybe just the Dakota, or just the Entrada properties were tied to this contract, but it is all the San Arroyo properties. Gerald - I will give you your copy Tues am. Mark - I will send a copy to you via interoffice mail.  I will not fax, since what I have is already hard to read. joan

Hope you had a safe journey back from the land of Cabo.  We made it back without a problem.  I am really getting hammered at work today.  Reality baby!  Apparently my clients just can't do without me. What did you guys do on your last night?  Let me guess. El Squid Roe.  Did your partners meet any new family members? I really had a great time hanging out with you.  It made my trip that much more memorable to be with a special person like you.  Drop me a note when you get a chance and let me know how you are. Take care, 
Susan,  Tri-States comments.  I plan to give them Colorado law but to discuss the other two with them.  Let me know your thoughts. 
Gerald: Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows: 1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well. 2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential, punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we should have three years to commence an action after termination. 3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is familiar with. Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is reasonable and appropriate. Thanks, 
Would you please stop wetting your cube and blaming it on me! 
Please see attached spreadsheet. Jeff Gilliam 
GT,  Man you are killing me with that story of the naked blonde.  I almost cried for not going now.  Is she still married, because if not I want to propose. Cabo was pretty sweet.  Plenty of sun, sand, and women.  Hooked up with a chick from Seattle for most of the week and had a great time.  We went fishing one day and caught a 100 lb. swordfish.  Took a portion of it to a restaurant and they cooked it for us.  Awesome.  There were tons of Honeymoon couples down there.  You might want to check it out.  It is a short flight and pretty reasonably priced.  They have some great hotels as well. I will be coming in for the Houston game weekend after next, so have my room ready.  Talk at ya later. 
Dan,  Attached are the documents with my revsions.  Let me know if you have any questions. Attached for your review is the form of interruptible gathering agreement for ENA on Lost Creek.  Please let me know of any comments you may have. (See attached file: ENA-Lost Creek IT Agrmnt1.doc) 
Need  your help with an agency agreement per this email.  Let's talk about this one. 
I've been needing to set up Crescendo/ENA into Wildhorse's system, so that ENA can nom the gas starting October 1st.  Part of what I need to do is set up an agency agreement with contact names stating that ENA will be making the noms on behalf of Crescendo under transport contract xx, and yy.  The transport contracts I have are to Questar [current Enogex transport contracts].  I called Becky Shulz [Wildhorse] to talk again about what all I need to do, and [""playing dumb""] was asking her what the NWPL contract # was that I needed to set up in my paperwork.  She said she would have to look at the map to see exactly where our wells were...to find which interconnect was best, but before she did that, she needed to discuss this with Kent, but more so to make sure that he has all the paperwork he needs, re NG assigning this contract to us.  Kent will be out of the office until Friday. Noms are due in about 1.5 weeks. joan 
Please disregard the version I sent about 30 minutes prior and use these.

Attached is the latest draft of the letter to Wildhorse concerning the Dakota production.  Some revisions have been made based on our meeting Tues. and Ken Krisa's comments to the earlier version.  Please review and provide any comments. 
Tony,  The following steps follow the contract amendment (assumes Bloomfield contract): 1.  Calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure. 2.  Subtract the hours in #1 from the total hours in the month. 3.  Calculate the Monthly Contract Quantity as defined in the amendment (Bloomfield -- 7000 times # of hours developed in #2 above) 4.  Calculate the Load Factor as defined in the agreement. Since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the Force Majeure Event, we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #4 above if not for the Force Majeure event. Thus, 5.  Multiply the Load Factor times 7000 (max HP-hrs) times # of hours of force majeure event.  This gives you the equivalent HP-hours that would have been used during the Force Majeure event or Supply Interruption. 6.  In accordance with the amended Section 3.2(a), to calculate HP-hour charge do the following: Multiply Conversion Factor (taken from Exhibit based on load factor) times (Shaft Energy delivered + Equivalent   HP-hours during Force Majeure [this is the number calculated in #5 above]) times 1.031. Let me know if you have any questions.  We can work through an example if we need to.  Thanks. 
fyi 
Gerald, This is the letter that went out.  Minor change to the last paragraph to make it more accurate.  This will go out today. Ken Krisa 
Attached are the latest schedules and supplements.  Still waiting on the revised financial statements. 
Attached for review is a redline of the latest revisions to Schedules to the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Also attached are various supplements to the schedules.

Hi Dee Dee OK, It is at about this point in time when my thoughts turn to my next vacation.  Jeez, criminy (little Seattle lingo) have I been busy this week. Looking forward to the weekend to chill out a little.  No big plans but to enjoy the college football extravaganza on Saturday.  Maybe grill some beast depending on the weather and partake of a few sodas.  It has been raining here all week which is good, because at least it isn't 107 degrees out. My clients in Denver wanted a full download on all my Cabo activities.  These are the guys who have been to Cabo several times including the 20/20 club. As a matter of fact, the project I am working on right now for these guys is called Project 20/20.  Coincidence, I don't think so.  Anyway, when I told them I met this girl who went to 20/20 with me, they were very impressed. They now hold me in higher esteem than before.  At least that's one way to gain the respect of your clients. So how is the great Northwest? Have your told grandparents about the wonderful time you had in Cabo with some strange guy walking around in your shoes.  Some details are probably better left out. I am about out of here.  Take care and I will talk to you later. 
I know love isn't enough by itself.  We have to give each other more.  The types of things that make the other feel full and complete in life.  We have focused on material things,  when really more meaningful things, such telling the other that you have an interesting way of looking or thinking about some facet of life are what fills each other.  We are both bright and ambituous people who should be able to enjoy the finer things in life, but in the right context.  Not as direction, but as background to connecting as husband and wife.  Husband and wife means many things; friends, supporters, providers, sounding boards, lovers,  shoulder to cry on, someone to just hold onto, or walk hand in hand on the beach.  I want to do these things for you and want you to do them for me.   Hope you can think of me. Love,

Steve, Per our previous discussions, I am preparing to draft assignments of the following processing agreements (between 3rd Party Processors and HPLR) from HPLR to HPLC.

Also taken off were references to the documents that have been prepared and sent to Gillette (that information was contained in brackets and began ""[See Attached ....].

Hi Kelly,    Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, but have been swamped.  I am thinking the South Carolina game works.  However, what does a flight to Florida cost?  I need to factor that in as well, as I am planning on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$. I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.  It is pretty intense.  I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will probably go. ""Kelly OBrien"" <kjobrien@duke-energy.com> 09/18/2000 10:53 PM

Sat Oct 21 7-11 pm It would be great if he did, I have the perfect role! I'll need his mailing address and e-mail...... Thanks, Later buddy Mark 
No need to worry.  I won't send that picture to anyone.  Now the one with Eric and the smoke hanging out of his mouth will be distributed to ALL ENRON EMPLOYEES. Dina Snow@ENRON 09/25/2000 09:08 AM 
I probably don't need to mention this to you, but I'm trusting that you won't send ""shot"" picture to ANYONE.  I thought you might get a chuckle out of it, and it was fun that night, but I would die if some of the more straight-laced people around here caught a glimpse of it! 
Rude Dog, Maverick,  It's no good up here.  I'm holding on too tight.  I've lost the edge. Yes, it is close.  I am pretty pumped.  I am also extremely nervous about Barnette and their passing game.  Looks like Walker and Hill will be the starting corners.  Yikes!  I think our defense will be able to put some pressure on Barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now.  If we don't get any pressure on Barnette, I think we will likely lose this game. But I am hopeful that big Shaun Rogers will wreak havoc in the middle. The offense is still a big questions.  The level of talent on the OL gives me comfort.  Davis, Kirk-Hughes (so big they gave him two names), Roesler, etc. are all big time.  The 1st series should be really interesting.  I think we come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense.  Then start sending Ike off Roesler and Davis.  Occasionally send Flowers down the field on the fly and have Applewhite throw it as far as he can.  It is going to be a good one. Which game is the first one you'll be able to go to?  How are the Australian women?  Bring pictures and stories.  Preferably with much embellishment. G$ Bruce Rudy@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 08/24/99 09:35 PM 
G$- Well, only 4 more days to go until kickoff.  What do you think about the game?  I saw that we are 9.5 point favorites.  I personally would love to win by that much.  NCSt.'s passing attack really scares me.  I guess I still don't have a lot of confidence in our CBs yet.  I think that Jammer and Jackson(from what I have read) are solid in the middle and our front 4 is just plain stout.  We have alot of depth at LB as well, so I guess we will need to get maximum pressure on  Barnette to help out JW, EH, AB, & RB. Offensively, from what I have been reading, it sounds like Applewhite has been very sharp and our RBs aren't going to be as weak as I first thought. Also, I understand the OL is coming along quite well. So, do we win?  How do you see the game unfolding?  I won't get it out here, but I will try to listen to it on the internet.  I can't wait to get back and watch these games! Talk to me Goose. Bruce

Here it is. 
Attached is redlined copy of  the confirm with the changes we discussed. Please review 
FYI 
To All: After speaking to Bill, we are giving approval to this second transaction between JM Huber and ENA with the condition that the assignment of transport capacity is taken on by JM for BOTH transactions as previously discussed, and I initial this contract which clearly states this assignment of capacity.  It was our assumption, in Credit, that this initial transaction with JM was to include the assignment of capacity, which lead to a re-evaluation of the credit reserve.  It is imperative now, that once the contract and transactions are executed, they be re-confirmed in TAGG to more accurately reflect the exposure of JM Russell 
Attached is a clean and redlined copy.  Mark,  Please note Russell Diamond with credit wants to initial these contracts before credit will approve the transaction from ENA's side.  I will send him the latest drafts. 
Attached is the latest drafts.  These went to Huber for execution this afternoon 
Hi Katie,    Sorry it has taken awhile to respond.  I have been out of town for awhile. Good to hear from you again.  I understand about the summer.  Sometimes we get so busy and it seems like weeks go by without noticing. I had a good summer.  My little sister got married up in Estes Park, Colorado in August.  Estes is a neat little town near Rocky Mountain National Park.  I spent four days up there.  My whole family made the trip, so that was cool. The weather up there is awesome.  I played around of golf and I don't think it ever got above about 75 degrees.  They had the reception at the Stanley Hotel.  This hotel was where Stephen King was staying when he got the inspiration to write the Shining.  No weird events occurred at the reception though. I also just got back about 2 weeks ago from Cabo San Lucas.  I spent 8 days down there with some friends.  Scuba diving, fishing, beach, drinking, and dancing.  Not necessarily in that order though.  I was a little worried about being down there for that long, but it was great once I got used to partying till 4 am and sleeping til noon. Enron is going well.  We just closed another big deal last week, so the pressure is off for now again.  There will surely be another next quarter. Can't wait . I feel for you concerning statistics.  Actually that was one of the courses that gave me the most problems in engineering school.  I must admit I probably didn't try as hard as I should have.  I just hated the course so much that I just wanted to get it over with.  Hang in there.   You will get through it.  Is this your last semester?  If I remember correctly, I thought you were going to graduate in December. It is really good to hear from you again.  Take care and drop me a note when you get a chance. Gerald 
Attached are the revised gas purchase and gathering agreement and the new Collection Facilities Agreement.  The Collection Facilities Agreement has the insurance requirements but not the Security Documents.  I will forward the Security Doc. shortly. 
Attached is a revised nomination letter incorporating comments received. Please review 
Hi Dee, I am really sorry to hear about your brother's child.  I hope everything with you and your family is as well as it can be right now.  I will say a prayer for yall. I am doing good.  Staying busy with work as you suggested.  Actually we closed our big deal last Thursday.  That will allow my hours to become somewhat more normal in the near future.  They are planning a trip to reward those who worked so hard on this deal.  Guess where? Cabo. Went to Austin this past weekend to watch my beloved Longhorns play.  They won, fortunately.  It was good to see some old friends and hang out.   I wouldn't mind moving back to Austin, but the jobs there just don't pay as much as in Houston.  Everyone wants to stay in Austin after school, so they can lowball you on the cash. Looking forward to the pictures.  Need to refresh my memory of Cabo.  Take care and talk to you later.

Attached is the security document form.  Section 5.4 is missing and I will provide tommorrow.  However, in the interest of time I am forwarding the agreement for review. 
A redlined version with my changes.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
Kay, Please review the attached data sheet and let me know if there are any problems.  Thanks. 
GT,   I will be coming to this game w/o Lisa.  I plan on driving in Friday night and probably getting there about 9:00 pm.  If its okay I'll crash at your place.  Let me know how your schedule looks. Since Lisa isn't coming I'll have an extra ticket with me on the 35. 
Barbara,  I put hard copies of these documents in your chair. 
This version includes the Section 5.4 language. 
Attached is a rough draft of a response letter to Wildhorse concerning the nominations.  Barbara and I are still reviewing, so there will be some further changes, but in the interest of time, I thought I would send this out for everyone's review. 
GT,  I think I will probably come in tonight since the game is so early.  Are you guys going to try and buy tickets at the gate for BB?    Email back with your phone numbers, so I can call if anything changes.  Talk at ya later. 
Sounds like your little cousin is continuing to strike out on the airline tickets.  It really breaks my heart to see the once great web master fall so far. Maybe we should have assigned him the task of color coordinating his pants and shirts for the trip. 
Attached is a clean and redline version of the documents.  I have the Powder River Basin Exhibit and can fax if you want to review. Please note that I added a section that allows Enron to relocate units if they are underutilized at their current location.  This was resultant of the 5 year term for the units contracted for during the initial 2 year period. 
Scott,  Attached is the memo from local counsel in Denver.  Per Barbara's voice mail, both her and I agree with the content of the memo.  Craig is an experienced litigator in Denver.  Please review and let's discuss. 
Sorry for the delay.  Here is the letter

The pictures were very amusing.  Thanks for sending those along.  Looks like you guys hung out quite a bit with the neighbors.  I especially like the candid shot of me in my Tommy Hilfiger's.  Whoa, got to start working out and shed the love handles.  I thought there would be more shots of Squid Roe since that is where you guys hung out most of the time. Looks like your Mariners made the playoffs.  I really don't follow Texas but I do follow the Astros.  I think everybody is just happy the season is over with so we can forget it as quickly as possible.  The Astros were pretty horrible this year. Hope you are doing well.  Did you keep Julie and Angie out of trouble this weekend?  I know that is probably impossible.  Thanks for the pics again and I'll talk to you later. 
I would call Kent and ask about this.  I would also remind him about our request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period prior to the effect date of the agreement. Mark,  We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your discussions and communications with Wildhorse.  Dan, Has been preparing his notes and you may want to just add onto his notes. Dan,  I also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance. Mark Whitt@ENRON Sent by: Mark Whitt@ENRON 10/02/2000 10:34 AM 
Did you see this Gerald.  They have taken out one of our compressors.  Should I call Kent Harris? Mark 
Shark see attached notes (on the excel spreadsheet) re: compression removal at San Arroyo....its ugly. Also, I told Ken to (remember to) add you as his primary contact. D 
Bob,  Please print out 2 copies and have Hanover execute.  Please fax signature today to me at (713) 646-3490 and FEDEX or Courier complete contracts to me at: EB3883 1400 Smith Houston, Tx 77002 Thanks for your help. 
fyi. 
I spoke with Kent Harris at Wildhorse today and he stated there position to me on a few things. 1.  Our Interruptible noms to NWPL for Wed. were not cut due to contractual reasons, we were cut due to a lack of capacity.  He said that the San Arroyo #2 compressor was down and without it they cannot make additional deliveries to NWPL.  They hope to have it up by friday and will try to provide us some capacity into NWPL. 2.  Kent reiterated their position regarding our contract by stating that ""the intent of the original contract was not to take gas through other systems other than the Mesa system"".  In addition he stated that we do not have the right to choose which pipeline our gas is delivered to. 3.  He also asked whether or not we were willing to negotiate on the current situation or if we wanted to let the 'lawyers fight it out"".  I reiterated that we have been waiting for them to either acknowledge that they will gather the entrada gas under the current contract or provide us with another alternative.  Absent either of those 2 things happening all we can do is try to live by the existing agreement.  He stated that they have new estimates on the cost to construct a new line through the South Canyon and it is approximately $1MM less than their original esitmate. We left it that he would determine whether or not they would gather  the Entrada under the existing contract or make a new proposal that would most likely wrap the Entrada and Dakota up under one new deal and replace the existing contract. I told him we would determine whether or not we wanted to ""let the lawyers fight over the existing contract"" or work on a new deal for all the production. P.S.  They are still very interested in some type of Joint Venture. Mark 
Liz Orr with Wildhorse just called to inform me we cannot nominate into NWPL.   Her legal department has informed her there are issues with the contract and until they inform her otherwise, our gas can only flow into Questar.   Physically, we can flow into NWPL but contractully we cannot. We have changed the nominations back to Questar for tomorrow's gas day. Sorry about that, (we tried) Theresa 
Davis,  This actually sounds frighteningly like my experience at the Big 12 Game.  However, just because I at one time worked at the Posse doesn't mean my character should continue to be called into question. Davis Thames@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 10/04/2000 09:27 AM 
FYI,  The call to Kinder may not be needed. 
Bob Mustard from Tom Brown called me at 5:00 today to inquire as to my understanding of the Wildhorse/Crescendo issues.  I explained to him the situation in a nutshell and he told me that they thought they would have completed the acquisition this week but should be finished next week.  He asked if we were still interested in acquiring the Mesa system and I told him that I thought we were interested in the gathering system and potentially theTom Brown  reserves.  He said they are very interested in talking to us about a deal on these properties and will forward a Confidentiality Agreement to me tomorrow. He also mentioned that there is a conference call tommorow at 11:00 A.M. central time between Crescendo and Wildhorse.  Wildhorse has asked that Tom Dyk and Pete Schere (Tom Brown execs) participate in that conference call. Tom and Pete are not comfortable participating in that call given the situation at hand.  Therefore, he asked if we could have Ken Krisa or someone else postpone the meeting. Let's Discuss at your earliest possible convenience. 
Attached is a form agreement for the Oakhill Transaction.  Please note the italicized sections of the CSA.  I am not sure what the terms quoted to Oakhill have been with respect to interruptions in service and adjustments to energy pricing.  We may want to leave these sections blanks for now.

Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the CIG agreement with my revisions.  The redline is compared against the version you had forwarded earlier via email.  Sorry for the delay.  I will be at the ENA Legal Conference this afternoon and tomorrow.  Please leave a voicemail if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Oooouch!    That one hurt.  We really kicked their butt all over the field. The defense played well, especially Ahmad Brooks.  I don't think he had one completed on him all night. What really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team. I am trying not to get too down about this.  This is  a young team that is going to make mental errors and they will improve.  I still thinks we will have a good season. The only freshman I saw getting any PT was Cory Redding.  He looks fast out there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return.  He also got some snaps at DE on a couple of 3 and longs, but didn't do anything outstanding. Unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles. Victor Ike should be our starting tailback.  He look big and fast and gets yardages running in the interior.  Ike left a defender looking really stupid on his long TD run.  Sweet moves.  Hodges look about like he did last year. Had a couple of good runs but doesn't seem to use his blocking very well. OK, so we will begin our win streak with Stanford.   The thing I really like was that Mack said he takes full responsibility for the punting problems and that he will insure that they get fixed.  Mackovic would have made excuses that essentially put the blame elsewhere.   This season could be an up and down one, but the real prize is next year and the years after.

Attached is a revised LOI for WT1.   I took out all the language concerning materials and equipment obligations incurred by ECS.  After talking with Knippa, I understand that after the sale of the motor to TW, they will be doing all of the installation.  Please review and provide comments. 
Attached are redlines of the restated Huber confirms with the netting language we discussed.  Please review and lets discuss. 
Kay,  Please see the attached.  Thanks. 
Mike, I reviewed the pages to the site you provided.  My only comment right now is that the correct name of the pipeline is ""Houston Pipe Line Company"". Note the Pipe Line is two words.  Everything else looks fine.  We will be getting back with you on the site access agreement. 
No problem.  I will review these and get back with Cheryl.  Thanks. Shari Stack 09/01/99 12:34 PM 
Attached are some letters that Cheryl King from HPL has prepared. I think it would be more appropriate for you ( or someone from your group) to OK these as from reading the email, I gather that you do the legal work for HPL. Can I leave it with you to get with Cheryl King? Many thanks, Shari 
I am forwarding this information to you because I do not know if Legal has reviewed her letters prior to sending them. 
Here they are.  I will probably hear from Kathy later today as to whether or not they need any changes. Since HPL Resources & Houston Pipe Line have several RRC System Numbers, the 2nd attachment is the exhibit that goes with the 1st letter.  But, ECT only has one RRC System Number since they don't own any pipe, so that letter doesn't need an attachment. Connie Sutton 09/01/99 10:37 AM 
Can you please send me a copy of the letters you sent to the RRC? Cheryl D King 09/01/99 08:54 AM 
Connie, I just wanted to let you know that since I was already working with the Railroad Commission (RRC) to get HPL Resources Company automatically replaced with Houston Pipe Line Company as purchaser on the P-4's, I went ahead & drafted a letter to do the same for the change from ECT to Enron North America Corp.  I faxed both letters to Kathy Way at the RRC, who is responsible for all automatic P-4 changes.  She will let me know if the letters look okay.  If so, I will need to get the appropriate officers to sign them & send them to her at the RRC.  Since she only does this at the beginning of the month & doesn't backdate the effective date, the change will be effective 10/1/99, assuming we have a P-5 in place for Enron North America Corp. before then. The current P-5's are filed thru Gerald Nemec's office.  Will they be filing for this new one?  If not, do you want me to pursue this?  Please let me know so that we can get this completed in a timely manner. Thanks. Cheryl King     -     EB3765     -     x-36982

Mark,  Attached are riders to be added to the CIG  Confidentiality Agreement.  Please forward these for review to the proper persons at Coastal.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
We should again nominate to NWPL .  In our nomination we can state that if Wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to NWPL, we then nominate to Questar solely to mitigate damages.  I can draft the appropriate letter. Joan or Ken, Will the nominations be done via the web site?  Do we have the information to nominate to NWPL via the website? ""Ken"" <kckrisa@apex2000.net> 10/23/2000 08:57 AM Please respond to kckrisa 
Joan, Gerald; What is the game plan for November nominations?  Do we want to go through the same deal as before and nominate on NWPL, get rejected, and renominate on Questar?  Or, do we want to nominate on Questar and include a statement that we are nominating on Questar only because of last month's ordeal? Tom Brown and Wildhorse are supposed to close today - if they didn't get their late last Friday. Ken Krisa 
Audrey,  Attached is a term sheet that Barbara Gray prepared some time back for the OE agreement.  Please review.  How does tomorrow afternoon look for you.  About 2:00 pm. 
I am not sure if these letter were sent out yet or not.  My only comment would be to add an effective date of the name change from HPLR to HPLC and ECT to ENA.   The latter is effective Sept.1, 1999.   If you have any questions, please contact me a x33512.

Wednesday works for me.  Morning would be a good time for me. Audrey O'Neil 10/23/2000 01:58 PM 
Gerald- I have the Lost Creek Members Meeting tomorrow.  What's your schedule later in the week?  Are we busy people, or what? Take Care, Audrey 
Ken,  Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail our volumes since we have a first que position.  We could draft the letter such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.  In the event that Wildhorse would only accept noms. 50% (or some portion) of this gas to NWPL, we would nominate the remainder to Questar to mitigate Wildhorse's damages. Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que obligation to move it there. From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause problems.  However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there. ""Ken"" <kckrisa@apex2000.net> 10/23/2000 02:37 PM Please respond to kckrisa

Hi Janel,  We have a couple of things on the agenda.  Friday night is Fastball at the Engine Room.  We plan on meeting on W. Alabama Ice House prior to the show.  Doors open at 9 pm so we will probably be at the Ice House around 7 ish for free dogs and cold beer. Saturday is The Buzz Monster Mash with the Toadies.  Some placed called Americas near Enron Field.  Never heard of it.  There are about 3 other bands. Vallejo, and two others I can't remember.  Show starts at 7 pm. Tickets are still available for both shows through ticketmaster.  There are about 4 to 5 people going, including myself and Eric as the foundation.  If you guys are interested in either or both, more people would be kickin.  Let me know. Janel Guerrero@ENRON 10/24/2000 08:31 AM 
Hi.  I'm trying to be organized and thought I'd check in to see if you guys are around this weekend.  If you want to try and meet out, Anne and I are ""lookin' for a good time"". 
No acid rock, just good easy listening tunes.  Fastball had the hit about 2 years ago called The Way.  Toadies; they just rock.  We will probably dress as under-appreciated, under-paid and fairly disinterested attorneys. Janel Guerrero@ENRON 10/24/2000 10:58 AM 
Sounds fun and musically fulfilling.  What sort of music do these bands play?  Is it all acid rock?  Are you and Eric dressing up as members of KISS? Gerald Nemec@ECT 10/24/2000 10:38 AM

His name is Eric Gillaspie.  We will be at your casa shortly after 12. Looking forward to it. Hook'em. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
I would be happy to handle this, unless you want to.  Let me know.  Thanks. 
One of the trading desks is ready to support a new product on EOL for transportation capacity.  This should be a very simple product.  At this point we don't need anything to feed back from EOL to Sitara at all.  The product can easily be added on the current gas screen with no new fields at all on the front screen.  We will explain the product in detail in the Product Description.  The attachment below shows an example of how the fields would look for the product, and a first draft at a Product Description.  I have only done a description of one product--at this time I am aware of three different products like this. Gerald, Steve-- I have made a feeble attempt at a Product Description--it obviously needs one of you to ""fix it up"".  We can discuss my intent after you have had a chance to review it.  Just call me once you decide who should handle this--Jeff Hodge suggested that I start with you two. Dave-- What does your schedule look like the rest of the week?  I'd like to get together with you and get a timeline for introduction of this.  Since I don't think there is any major programming at all, my impression is that we could get something out there as quickly as we can do all the legal work.   I also need to know who else I need to include in this, what the next steps are, etc.  Please let me know the process so we can get moving. Thanks for your assistance. 
I sm preparing to open up a bidding activity for the subject Pipeline which is approximately four miles of 12"" pipe under account # 3224.  The nbv is $18,901. I have dusted off my list of salvage bidders and under separate cover will publish these seeking additions or deletions from any of you who care to contribute.  ;I am assuming that this pipe is not viably operating and would appreciate any information in this regard if I am incorrect. As for now, I would like a sample Purchase and Sale Agreement and a Confidentiality Agreement that I may use with my solicitations.  This would include some type of alignment sheet depicting the pipe and its legal description, etc.  You are all seasoned in knowing what level of data I need at this stage of the offer. I already have at least one interested party in this and would like to move forward as soon as possible to get this on the table for bids.  I would appreciate receiving the necessary materials by October 31, or information of how I can contribute to this activity.  Also, please let me know if there is someone else I should copy on this. 
Can you place these on my calendar please.  Thanks. 
Attached is a memo regarding the above-referenced meeting. 
Cheryl,  We will handle the name change for ECT to ENA on the P-5 form. Mary,  When you get a chance, come be and let's talk about what need to be done. Cheryl D King 09/02/99 01:49 PM 
FYI: The HPLR to HLPC change isn't a name change.  It is just numerous assignments from HPLR to HLPC.  From what I've been told, HPLR is still a good company for now. As far an an effective date, the actual name change from ECT to ENA is effective 9/1/99, but since we don't already have our paperwork into the RRC requesting the automatic P-4 change, the RRC will make it effective 10/1/99, provided we have all of our paperwork into them before then. The date of most of the assignments from HPLR to HPLC (some via ECT first) is 7/1/99.  But, again, as far as the P-4 changes are concerned, the RRC will make them effective 10/1/99, since they don't backdate automatic changes. I spoke to Kathy Way at the RRC again this morning.  She said that the letters are fine from their perspective.  I just need to get the appropriate signatures & mail them to her. But, they can't do anything with the ECT to ENA changes until ENA has a valid P-5 number. QUESTION:  Will your office be doing the paperwork to get a P-5 number for ENA?  Please let me know.  Thanks. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
I am not sure if these letter were sent out yet or not.  My only comment would be to add an effective date of the name change from HPLR to HPLC and ECT to ENA.   The latter is effective Sept.1, 1999.   If you have any questions, please contact me a x33512.

Dave,  Attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed.  The right to match option is a little less drastic than the ""saving sharing"" we discussed.  The savings sharing is a little more problematic to enforce.  We can discuss though, if that is really the way you want to go.  Please review and lets discuss. 
Attached for your review is a form of assignment for the Trailblazer Precedent Agreement between ENA and Trailblazer.  This assigns the PA from ENA to J.M. Huber Corporation.

I spoke with Bob Mustard with Tom Brown today and he stated that they were meeting again today and really felt like they would have the transaction completed today.  I know we have heard this before, but it does seem like it will be any day now.  I will keep you informed as I get more information.

Just working on a Courtney deal while thoughts of you pop into my head.  One of the things I really love about you is how humble you are.  You are beautiful, confident, and intelligent, and yet you don't act like you know 
Mark,  As far as I know, this hasn't been delivered to TW yet.  If you could print this on paper with an Enron Logo only.   I already have the ECS header on the document.  Steve Harris would be the right party. Mark Knippa 10/30/2000 08:31 AM 
Gerald, Do you know if this document has been delivered to TW? My guess is that it has not.  I will review, print, sign and have Melissa deliver to TW unless I hear differently from you. Who should this be delivered to at TW? Steve Harris? 
Attached is a letter to TW notifying them of the CDEC rate increase and requesting their election on the pricing adjustment.  Please review.  We need to get this to TW asap. 
Attached is a draft letter to Wildhorse for our noms. in November.  The letter again reserves all our rights.  Please review. Mark,  Is the cc list still correct? 
Ken,  Attached is the letter with a few slight revisions.  We added Bob Mustard to the cc list.  We are all ok with this version.  If you are fine with this please fax and mail hard copy as we have done before.  If you have any questions, feel free to call me at (713) 853-3512. 
Terry,  Attached is a PSA form we have used before with the perspective of Enron as buyer.

Some further detail on the site lease agreement: CounterParty is Black Hills Trucking, Inc Initial 1 year term, then month to month up to 2 years total Fee $800/month Black Hill will provide phone and electricity service hookup and Enron to reimburse Enron will directly pay phone and electricity bills Area is approximately  250 ft.

Carl Carter and myself are working with Colleen Sullivan to get Pipeline Secondary Capacity launched on EnronOnline.  I just want to touch base with you regarding the GTC and Product Descriptions. Gerald, according to our conversation you should have a draft early this week, please let me know where we stand so we are sure that it fits into EnronOnline structure so we can input some draft wording/structure into Test and start creating Products Please let me know if you have any questions/comments Thanks Carlos x5-8705 
Hi Sophie, I like the sound of the Trifle described in your email to Mark.  I will have extra Sherry on mine. How is it going?  I had a great time at the party in Austin and hanging with you at the Brown Bar.  I am not sure what I was thinking toward the end of the evening by mixing Tequila and Cranberry, but I guess you have to get creative when the circumstances require.    I was moving a little slow the next day and drive back to Houston wasn't quite as pleasant. Did you have a good weekend?  I didn't do anything real exciting for the weekend before Halloween.  Went to a concert that had 4 bands.  One of them is a band from Austin called Vallejo.  Heard of them? Now tell me the truth.  Do you really like Yorkshire Pudding?  Drop me a line when you get a chance. 
My comments are redlined into the doc.. 
Let me know if you have any questions. 
Please see attached

GT,   Great party.  Looking forward to the next one already. I think I left my cell phone charger in your apartment on your table.  If I did, just hold it.  I'll be back for Rice and pick it up then.  If not, I must have lost the damn thing somewhere else. 
Ken,      Attached is the CA with my comments. 
A few interesting deals.  Working on some products for Enron's B2B internet trading site.  ""www.enrononline.com""  The site was actually developed out of our London office.  Enron House is right next door to Buckingham Palace. Some other trading deals as well.  I usually get a pretty mixed bag of projects to work.  It has been very busy the last couple of days. Sophie Therapy?  That sounds extremely interesting.  Is it good for most of your normal life crisis type issues?  I might need some now and again. I know you probably told at the party, but as you remember my mental state was not clearest it could have been.  Are you a student at UT Law?  Forgive me for my mental lapses. OK, I have had Yorkshire Pudding and all I remember was a bland bread type substance.  Now the beef, vegetables, and potatoes sounds good to me but not sure about the Yorkshire.  Might help to wash it down with a nice pint. Take care, Gerald. ""Sophie Davenport"" <sophiedavenport@hotmail.com> 10/31/2000 10:31 AM 
Dear Gerald, I'm surprised you were moving at all the day after the party! I'm not to sure on the Tequila/Cranberry mix either but as you say - it's always good to try new things, I just wouldn't advise trying it again that's all!  I had a good time too, wasn't that drunk either by the end which is a bit of an unusual occurrence for me. This past weekend we had a party put on by the law school so we went to that Friday night and then shopped til we dropped on Saturday - my flat mate has been having a bit of a hard time so I gave her a day of Sophie Therapy - she seems a lot more relaxed now - I hope it will last. Saturday I also caught a cold so I've been feeling pretty rough the last couple of days although I think it's gradually going now so fingers-crossed I'll be okay to party hard this weekend  - although I've no plans as yet. Oh, I haven't heard of that band by the way but it sounds good anyway, and yes I do like yorkshire puddings - how can anyone not - obviously you should have the full compliment of beef, roast potatoes and vegetables and gravy (although I'll gladly do without the beef) but they're gorgeous - don't you think? Hmm. Anyway, better get on with some work, have a good week, whatever you're doing, any interesting deals? Sophie. 
From the Oklahoma 100: ""Waylon Turdsby, star TE from the reigning 3-A champion Chickasha Fighting Chick-Peas gave the Sooners a verbal commitment by letter late Wednesday according to OK100 sources. This is a big boost to the Sooners who were competing with Tulsa, Anadarko Junior College and out of state powerhouse Kansas for his services. Waylon, who is 6'2"", 218lbs and runs a 4.75 40 chose OU because ""They serve fried pork rinds in the cafeteria and the chicks there dig mullet hairdos"". Waylon plans to study business and eventually take over the family used car dealership. Waylon added ""My daddy says he has done a lot of business with Sooner coaches and boosters over the years and that OU would be the best place to refine my used car selling skills.""

Okay, brief resume of my life to date if you like: Born, grew up, (in England), am currently studying at Nottingham University (E. Midlands of England) although that's not strictly true as I'm here in Texas studying at UT Law School as part of an exchange scheme. I go back in June or whenever and finish my degree so will finally graduate in June 2002. (Fingers crossed). Other than that I don't do much else but eat, drink and be merry. Actually I play the viola (and sing a bit) and that took over my life back home but here I'm doing more of the drinking part of things - more wine than beer though it has to be said - also better for you - well, almost! So there you go - does that bring back any memories?! Hope you're having a fun week, happy halloween for yesterday - though I'm not sure how fanatical people are about it in Houston - they certainly seem to go all out for making a big deal of it here!

Attached is a discussion draft of the Compression Services Agreement for Gallup. 
If we did sign it prior to getting bank approval, we would likely have to make the WIC portion of the release, subject to the bank approval.  Otherwise Huber could be put into the position of having the obligations but being unable to complete it obligation due to a WIC process out of Huber's control.  But assuming that was done, I don't see why we couldn't sign the agreement now. Mark Whitt@ENRON Sent by: Mark Whitt@ENRON 11/02/2000 05:42 PM 
I spoke with Steve Saye at WIC today and he said that they interpret the tarrif to read that a release done at the full negotiated contract rate is the same as the maximum rate. Therefore we can release at the $.12 rate.  He also stated that he would begin the approval process with the banks for the release but thought that there would be no problem with Huber's credit.  He did state that the bank approval timing was out of his control but he would try to expedite it. In addition, he felt that the best way to do the release was to do it  with the first bidder meeting minimum terms and have Huber ready to take it.  He said that it would not have to be noticed ahead of time so noone would know that it was going  to hit the board. My question is, can we get the contract with Huber signed prior to receiving the bank approval for the WIC peice? Mark 
Mary,  I was out of the office on Friday and unfortunately have a conflicting meeting scheduled.  Please let me know what we need to do to work out the details. Mary Clark@ENRON 09/10/99 09:40 AM 
Gerald, you've been selected as United Way campaigner for Enron North America's legal department.  For Enron's United Way campaign only, all of legal is included in Corporate.  We'd really like to have you attend our campaigner training session Monday.  See the details below and let me know if you can make it.  If you can't attend, I will send you instructions on what to do.  Mainly, it's distributing pledge cards to employees in your group and following up to see if they've turned in their cards.  I look forward to meeting you. Mary

I haven't answered him yet.  I just plan to let him know that the contracts should be executed next week with the capacity release to occur thereafter. Any thoughts? 
Gerald, Can you please let me know where we stand with the execution of the JM Huber transactions and contracts that is being originated in the Denver office.  As you are aware the first transaction and contract we entered into did not contain the assignment language for the transportation on a yearly basis. The second transaction was to include this assignment language.  ENA currently has large exposure from JM Huber for the first transaction because the assignment contracts have not been signed as of yet, as far as I am aware.  If the contract negotiations are going to continue for an extended period of time, Credit is going to have to reserve the transactions to cover this exposure.  Please let me know what the status is. Thank you, Russell 
Mike,  Still working on it.  Should have a draft by late Monday or Tuesday. Sorry about the delay. Michael Eiben 11/03/2000 09:17 AM 
Hi Gerald, where are we with regards to the TPA & Registration agreements?  we have a demo scheduled for 11/14 and it would be nice to have those posted on the website. thanks,   mve 
Mike, I reviewed the pages to the site you provided.  My only comment right now is that the correct name of the pipeline is ""Houston Pipe Line Company"". Note the Pipe Line is two words.  Everything else looks fine.  We will be getting back with you on the site access agreement. 
Ron,  Attached is the assignment with my change redlined.  If you want to discuss, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.  Thanks.

Tom,  Attached is the Right of Way Services Agreement we discussed Friday.  I would like to thank you and Mark for meeting with us on short notice.  We look forward to working with you. 
Shonnie Daniel asked me to forward the attached document to each of you. 
I will remove the open season reference.  Some pipeline tariffs do refer to open season for capacity release, but it may cause confusion so probably to remove it. The terms you referenced are defined in the product description.  The EOL access agreement makes it clear that the product description is binding on the counterparty. Colleen Sullivan 11/06/2000 12:42 PM 
Last week I sent copies of the product description and GTC to Becky Cantrell (regulatory) for comments and she did make a couple of suggestions which I agree with.  First, in both the description and the original GTC we refer to an open season; however, this product is for capacity release, which would not be subject to an open season--only bidding.  So, Gerald, unless you have some objection that we have overlooked, I believe it is appropriate to remove the words ""or open season"" in the product description.  Regarding the GTC, since we were planning on eliminating Paragraph 3 anyway, which had the open season reference, I think that one is already taken care of. The other question she had is how we would define the following terms and how they would be made a part of the contract:  Reference Pipeline, Rate Schedule, Primary Receipt and Delivery Point.  Please let me know your thoughts on this. 
Attached are a redlined revised version of the GTC and the Product Description based on our comments discussions of the previous versions. Carlos, I made a few slight changes to the product description you sent earlier today   Please review. 
Russell,  The 2nd Huber transaction was executed and Huber is contractually bound to take assignment of the transportation.  We have gotten approval of the assignment form from the Pipeline and expect to execute the assignments and capacity release documents with Huber next week.  The capacity release document just specifies the details of the capacity release.  Huber is bound by the 2nd transaction to accept our release.    I will let you know when these sets of documents are executed. Let me know if you have any questions. Russell Diamond 11/03/2000 11:08 AM

Hi Marsha,    How is it going?  Nothing really exciting since Cabo.  Just work.  I am about to go to Spain for  8 days.  Should be fun.  Amazingly, I may be going back to Cabo in December for a business trip.  Don't ask me how I pulled that off. Are you ready to go back and use your time share? Good to hear from you.

Hi Melissa, Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they keep you busy at V&E. Yes, I do work for Enron.  I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas and power origination.   I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on a couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.  Terry Yates and David Keyes.  Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at Enron in our Global Finance Legal Group. Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big place, but I might know them. Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to location? In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip! 
Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined version of the purchase and gathering agreement.  There is no language in these agreement about a right to match outside of the Reserve Committment Area.

Lisa,  I feel so bad right now.  I never wanted anything but to be with you and love you the rest of my life.  I wish we knew how important it was to communicate with each other over the past years.  I think we are both guilty of not communicating.  It is easier to talk to some besides each other about certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been built up over our portion of a lifetime together.  It hurts to now clearly understand this after things have happened. I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may accept it as final.  I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely work on this relationship.  I want us to talk and do things together.  You

Let me just start by saying that if you to knuckleheads (Eric and Jen) would spend less time obsessing about my hair and more time working on your house, then maybe you would have a kitchen that didn't look like it belongs on Bob Vila's ""This Old House"".  Second, the style of my hair is not a pomp, as you ""commoners"" like to refer.  Once we arrive in Madrid, the Madrilenos will recognize me at once as royalty and I should be running that country inside of 2 days. Matt,  If you are still gassy by next week, you will be rooming with Eric and Jen. jennifer-gillaspie@reliantenergy.com 11/09/2000 02:56 PM 
Eric and I can type up a couple of possible itineraries this weekend, based upon some initial research. It'll include potential routes and possible sights to see along the way. I think we can basically decide as we go. We are also having dinner with someone Eric works with this Friday who has been to Spain recently with his family. They went down to the Andulusian White Hill towns near Seville. As you know, Eric and I were only in and around Madrid, so we'll pick this guy's brain. I agree about packing light. It sounds like we'll need a few sweaters though. I think it'll be between 50-60 during the day. I don't know if they have heat in Spain yet, so we may get cold at night. I'm pretty confident we could find a laundry mat if necessary. I don't want you to stink either, especially if you blow your butt out like in Minneapolis! Nasty!!! Please bring your adapter. I blow dry my hair in the mornings. Gerald will need to borrow it too in order to dry his pomp. Eric and I felt that it would be easier to make our hotel reservations once we get there. On day one, we arrive in the morning. Thus, we'll have plenty of time to check out a couple of pre-determined hotel options, especially since we're not in high season. We can discuss this weekend. Chao! ""Gillaspie, Matthew"" <MGillaspie02@pjc.com> on 11/09/2000 02:38:02 PM

Melissa,  I wasn't able to redline this version, but I added sections 10 and 11 and added futher language to Sections 3 and 6.  Hopefully you can redline it against your old version. Let me know what you think about environmental indemnity language.  I think is is prudent from the view that Black Hills and has been using the Premises for some time and we are not sure what is out there. 
Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00. I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point. That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went to law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2 years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair of glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses. South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?

Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the holidays like I'd hoped. I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there, too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.

If so, let me know when you want to get together and do the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the holidays like I'd hoped. I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there, too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.

Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00. I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point. That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went to law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2 years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair of glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses. South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there? ""Beckworth, 
Hi Melissa, Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they keep you busy at V&E. Yes, I do work for Enron.  I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas and power origination.   I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on a couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.  Terry Yates and David Keyes.  Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at Enron in our Global Finance Legal Group. Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big place, but I might know them. Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to location? In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good friends and work at the same school in Dallas.

Renee, Did Sofregaz ask for these changes?  If so did they recommend this specific language? 
Hal,  FYI, Attached is another form of O&M agreement specifically for offshore lines.  The structure of this agreement is different from our current deal, but the provided services in this form may be a good start for the Mariner O&M form. 
Breaker, Breaker,  that is the Mitchell Gas Service, L.P. agreement. 
You are very welcome!  I enjoyed it. Thanks for the name of the city.  We will probably be in Lisbon 2 days, so we'll try to check it out.  Thanksgiving in Spain/Portugal should be interesting?

We have scheduled a Project HIWAY demo for Tuesday, November 14, starting with lunch at 11:30.  The demo will be held in room 49C3.  At this time we will bring everyone up to date regarding the web site project of allowing shippers and operators of HPL the ability to access their respective contract and meter  information in a secured internet environment.  We will also discuss plans to allow shipper nominations and operator confirmations over the net. If you have any questions, please call. 
Hey that sounds like a better idea.  I will give the tickets to Shawna today.  I have them in my briefcase.  You can give me the $$ later.  The tickets are $40 each. kjobrien@duke-energy.com 11/14/2000 11:59 AM 
Are you sure you want to go to that trouble?  I could just have you take them to work and give them to Shawna and then I could pick them up from her.  I'm not sure that I trust the US Mail that much.  My address is 501 W 16th St, 77008, though if you prefer to go that route.  What do I owe you for them?  I can mail you a check if you want, or I could send some money with Shawna. Just let me know what you want to do. Thanks Gerald.Nemec@enron.com on 11/13/2000 06:46:32 PM

Hey Melissa, I am trying desperately to do everything I need to before I leave tomorrow. We are in the middle of performance reviews at Enron and I have to review about 10 others that I work with.  These are not easy to complete, but I guess I'll get through them. Wanted to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving before I left.  Have fun in FW and at the game.  That is the hardest part of going to Spain right now.  I sold my tickets to the game, but I will be there in spirit. We ought to go get some dinner after I get back.  I will be back next Monday.  Hopefully I won't have any disaster vacation stories of the type you told me at lunch! Take care,

Hello! Yes, I leave for Spain tomorrow at 1:30.  We arrive in Madrid about 8 am on Sat. Morning.  We will be in Madrid a couple of days, then spend our time in some towns south of Madrid for about 3 days.    The last couple of days we will be in Lisbon, Portugal.  Back in Houston next Monday.    Should be a good time.  I will let you guys know all about it at Christmas time.  Sounds like yall had a fun trip to Big Bend.  I have wanted to see the McDonalds Observatory.  That sounds pretty cool. Anyway,  thanks for the updates and I will talk to you as soon as I get back. Gerald Edward Nemec <ednemec@earthlink.net> 11/16/2000 10:40 AM 
I hear that you are going to Spain during the Thanksgiving Holidays? When are you going and where are you going. Sounds like a good trip give us the details before you leave huh!!!! We just got back from our Big Bend trip Tuesday evening. We really enjoyed it the mountains are awesome, you have to see it to get full effect of it. We saw Bracketville where they made the film Alamo and Lonesome Dove. That was really neat. Then we drove to Alpine and Fort Davis. We spent the night in the Davis Mountains Indian Lodge. We also saw Fort Collins,that night and the next day we drove to the McDonalds Observatory in the Davis Mountains. We got to look through all the big telescopes at the moon, venus, and saturn. The next day we went back to look at the sun and they took us to the Hobby Eberle telescope and told us all about it. Then we drove to Big Bend Park and stayed at the Lodge at the base of the Chiso Mountains. There is so many variations of rocks, mountains and deserts in that area. It was really something to see. James came over the other day and I was keeping Jacob, so I let them draw names for Christmas you have James's name and they didn't cheat either Ha..... well all for now Dad and I send our love hope all is going well........Love MOM

Mark,  I reviewed the CSA for our obligations.  They are as follows: 1.  ECS will work with the Utility in good faith to establish the online monitoring automatic load controlling system for the No. 21 Schedule. 2.  If the online system can not be established, then ECS will work with TW to develop a manual system to accomplish the same.  ECS will keep TW whole on any costs for incremental manpower required for such manual system. This provision was written very generally. Mark Knippa 12/01/2000 10:45 AM 
Gerald, here is the address I have for Jere.  I was discussing this with him today. Lets get it over to them so we can get the monitoring system going.  He indicated that Tri-State is in the process of changing/modifying how they monitor and charge for demand or peaking service.  I'm real interested to see what this is. Under our CSA we are required to provide TW/ET&S with some type of system to monitor the peaking from Tri-State (hence this conf. agreement).  The resources that we needed from EE&CC are now gone due to the restructure between EE&CC, EES and ET&S.  It's going to be money out of ECS's pocket I believe despite the fact that it was part of our agreement with EE&CC for the turnkey construction quote.  I also need to discuss with Courtney since he was heading up this effort. We may need to review exactly what our obligations are under the agreement. Oh, by the way, TW is developing an expansion of Gallup to up the system to a full 12,000 hp from 10,000. Tri-State Generation & Transmission Association, Inc. 1100 W. 116th Ave  P.O. Box 33695 Denver, Co. 80233 
Jere, I have the confidentiality agreements fully executed on our side.  What is your address, so I can forward to you for execution by Tri-State.  Thanks. 
I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.  The only comment I have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.  This is really a business call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to maintain.  I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.  I am OK with everything else. 
I will revise these for the exhibits when I am in Denver.  Do not delete. 
No problem.  I figured you weren't feeling well.  Sorry to hear that you are still sick.  You might want to call the doc.  I have been able to described my symptoms to her before and she usually calls in a prescription for me (Antibiotics or similar). Good luck with Global Markets.  Sounds like you had a lot of good opportunities.  I think you will learn a lot by trading which will make you a better originator if you ever want to go back to origination. I am pretty open right now for lunch.  Maybe Wednesday.  Let me know. Lisa Nemec 12/04/2000 09:14 AM 
Gerald - I am sorry that I didn't call this weekend.  I know we have a lot to talk about, but I have been sick all weekend and honestly couldn't face the stuff we have to face on top of it all.  I am still feeling ill, but was going crazy at home.  I don't know what I have, but I hope you don't get it. I decided to take the methanol job and stay in Global Markets, so my days are going to be decidedly busier.  Maybe we can get together for lunch later in the week to discuss how to move forward. I am sorry to do this over email, but as always it is difficult to talk at my desk.  Let me know what your schedule looks like this week and we'll work something out. Miss you, Lisa 
Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know I made it back safe and sound from Spain.  Spain is really a neat country.  Very charming. So I got James' name huh?  Who got my name in the drawing?  When is everyone 
Gerald, This is Black Hill's proposed changes to the contact for the lay down yard in Gillette.   We are already using it and Karl Durant will be in the process of getting the office set up and utilities starting Monday 9/27.   We should probably move quickly on this.   Thanks again. 
Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know I made it back safe and sound from Spain.  Spain is really a neat country.  Very charming. So I got James' name huh?  Who got my name in the drawing?  When is everyone coming in for the holiday?  I am planning on coming down the 23rd. 
Dan,  Any input you have on this contract would be appreciated. 
Gerald/Eric- I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference? I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily? 
David,  Have you had a chance to review these requirements?  Let me know. 
Dan,  Any input you have on this contract would be appreciated.

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily? Thanks for your help. 
I will draft a letter to Wildhorse concerning the pressure situation.  We have previously sent a demand letter on Sept. 29 for pressure data for the 3 year period, with no response from Wildhorse.  We need to reinforce the curtailment that the high pressure is causing the resultant loss of profits. I will circulate the letter for review by the group before sending. 
Brian,  Thanks for the camping trip this weekend.  It did help me clear my mind and sort some things out.  This is a tough time right now, but having good friends like you will help me get through this.  Thanks again. 
Attached is my revised letter.  Please call with any questions. 
Staci,  Your proposed language is acceptable.  Thanks for your help. STACI HOLTZMAN @ ENRON 09/27/99 03:17 PM 
Gerald --   To address your concerns raised in the proposed rider to Paragraph 11.2, we would suggest the following language be inserted as the last paragraph in Article XI: 11. __  Shipper retains its rights to raise objections of undue discrimination with regard to rates and/or terms and conditions applicable to Phase V service on grounds of undue discrimination; provided however, in the event Shipper has such objections, Shipper will provide Transporter with ten (10) days written notice prior to filing any such objections with FERC.

Attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes.   Please note the following: 1.  I added back the limitation on damage provision I originally had.  We need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only remedies. 2.  Changed both Seller and Buyer Minimum Volume Obligations to be consistent with each other. The amendment for the Powder River contract should reflect the same.  Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you would like to discuss. 
Attached is the revised letter based on Chris' voicemail on Friday.  I also added a 30 day window during which ENAP must provide the data to Enron. Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Note that we still need to legal entity's name from the South America office. 
We settled up on the tix.  You gave me some cash.  We're good. I have never been to Acapulco.  The only place on the Pacific side I have been to is Cabo.  Most people that have been to Acapulco really like it though. Don't worry about the end of the evening.  Strange things always happen at 6 am after we have been up all night.  Forget about it.  Have fun in Mississippi. kjobrien@duke-energy.com 12/10/2000 07:10 PM 
I know we talked about it, but did I ever pay you for the UT/A&M tickets Friday night?  If not, send me your address and I'll drop a check in the mail to you since I'll be out of town much of the rest of the year. Speaking of which, have you ever been to Acapulco?  Cyndi and I are going there for Christmas.  If you've been, let me know if you have any recommendations for things to do down there. Thanks again for going the other night.  Hope I didn't make you too uncomfortable at the end of the evening.  A little too much alcohol there at the end of the evening. 
That is unbelievable.  Make you really stop and think and put things in perspective. I am planning on coming in for the game.  Probably Friday night since the game is earlier than last time.

Congratulations!! On behalf of all of the Asset Group I would like to extend our appreciation and congratulations for making Hanover Measurement Services (HMS) a reality. A year of creative effort and determination, has transformed the project from the sale/leaseback of HPL's metering equipment into a viable measurement services company.    HMS provides the opportunity to reduce HPL's operating costs and leverage Enron's technical expertise to provide measurement services to third party customers. This project is an example of how the Asset Group must leverage our resources and existing assets to create sustainable, recurring earnings in the years ahead.  Each of you contributed to this success and your efforts are greatly appreciated by HPL and senior Enron management.  Our task now is to expand HMS' customer base and position the company to take advantage of emerging measurement, communications and systems technology. Again, congratulations on establishing and financing HMS, and please share our appreciation with team members who assisted you in this success. Regards, Brian

On or about September 23, 1999 a request for service was placed by the above referenced counterparty.  The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement.  These agreements were forwarded to the counterparty, CCNG, Inc..  On or about October 6, 1999, Kelly Cloud, Senior Vice President of CCNG, Inc. (713) 235-1972, called and informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM, L.P..  Further, she informed me that Section 7 of the agreement, which reads  in part: Gas is free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed because the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and/or  is subject to liens.  She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of Section 7. Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7.  Kelly Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions. Thanks. Marlene D. Hilliard 
The National Transportation Safety Board recently divulged a highly secret plan they had funded with the U.S. auto makers for the past five-years. The NTSB covertly funded a project whereby the auto makers were installing black boxes in four wheel drive pick-up trucks in an effort to determine, in fatal accidents, the circumstances in the last 15 seconds before the crash. They were surprised to find in 49 of the 50 states the last words of drivers in 61.2% of fatal crashes were, ""Oh, Sh*t!"" Only the state of Texas was 
Jordan,  Attached is the latest structure.  This is still subject to change as AA has not yet approved.  The deal basically involves creating a new entity to take ownership of 2 existing Electric Compressor Motor Drivers and associated contracts which ECT currently owns.  The compressor motor drivers are supplied with electricity from the Navajo Tribal Utiltity Authority (NTUA).  ECT sells horsepower created by the motor drivers to Transwestern in exchange for $$ and MMBtus. Lance Schuler will be working the finance portion of this project.  This is a 2nd Quarter deal.  Would you expect anything less?  Please let me know who will be working on this from your group or call to discuss any questions. Thanks.

AP-- In a shocking move that will have the rest of the Big 12 playing recruiting ""catch-up"", OU has snatched a solid commitment from all-state wide out Delmer Shanks As a freshman, Shanks is expected to play in the ""Opossum"" set of OU's daunting new offense. ""The opossum spread is going to really fool people next year"", Shanks explained in a phone interview from an Oklahoma Kwickie Mart. ""In the possum set, we take the left tackle and line him up out with 2 or 3 of our receivers. I lay up in the backfield, like a opossum, and then the center hikes the ball to the Tight End and then it's a hand off to either me or the quarterback."". When asked about why he commited to OU in the middle of the season, a usually slow time of year for recruiting, Shanks had this to say. ""Well it was a no-brainer really.Skoalis going to be sponsoring OU athletics next year, so it just seemed like a natural fit. I really liked what they're gonna do with the uniforms, that sown-in dip ring they're putting on everyone's back pockets are gonna look real nice. They're also gonna do some neat stuff with the Switzer center too, gonna sell moon pies and

Marlene,  We need to ask the counterparty what type of liens they have on their gas and we would want to limit it to those types in the contract.  We need as specific a description as possible.

Not sure what I am supposed to do with this. 
I threw out the United Way documents; as I did not plan to contribute.  If you have extra documents, you can fill one out that says I will not contribute. 
Not sure if these are anything near what you are looking for but FYI. 
D-Rock,  Attached are a clean and redlined copy with my comments.  I have noted a couple of areas where I still have questions. One that I didn't note in the agreement, is my concern that they could deny us a new Delivery Point if we can't agree on terms.  We need to discuss this one tommorrow.  I will shout out at ya tommorrow. 
Gerald this reflects the concern I spoke to you about yesterday;please draft a cover letter for my review and our discussion.  Thank you. 
As per our conversation yesterday, I have a heightened concern about the CPS Interconnect Agreement as drafted, as it implies that HPL can perform at certain levels based on the facilities being installed.  This is incorrect in probably all cases, and I need your assistance in drafting a cover letter to help clarify HPL's position to CPS as to our ability to perform, and more so, our contractual obligation to perform relative to this proposed contract draft.  All this contract does is agree that HPL will allow the facilities they are requesting to be installed, subject to Tejas Gas' approval (JV responsibility), at their cost.  There is no commitment to flow any volume of gas on any basis under this agreement.  Any such obligation would have to be negotiated and agreed to in writing separately.  Please provide draft response.  If you have any questions, please call.

Mr. Nemec, Did you receive the latest WIC supplement dated 10/12/99 ?? I read it and didn't have any problems with it. It gives us VOLUMETRIC firm rights at 80% of the max. recourse rate on the excess ramp up volumes. The supplement letter agreement has Enron Capital and Trade Resources Corp. which can be crossed out and changed - I talked to WIC about this already. The FTSA has Enron North America Corp. Let me know. Mike

Ted,  Attached is a revised draft of a letter.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  Please note the following with respect to this issue: 1.   We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality problem.  I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter. 2.  The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this letter.  The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs. of the the pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the Confirm.  Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream pipe.  HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas richness). 3.  The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we will reference Force Majeure. 4.  Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?  If you are okay with the letter, I can have a        paralegal prepare the letters with addresses. 
Gerald, Manuel Lojo's email is down this AM.  I am sending his modifications to the document. Bob Stamp - att1.htm - 7CAPACITY LEASE3RED.doc

Reimbursement of Costs 2nd sentence  and construction of the Interconnect  Change to:and the construction of the Acacia Facility 5. Operation Item II Last sentence  Add:transfer measurement of the gas for the Gas Purchase Item iii   Second sentence  Insert:are equal to gas purchasers nomimnations Item iv   Last sentence  Delete: monthly  change to:continuous Item VIII second sentence  Change from low case to high case  Gas Purchase Agreement 10. Term First sentence  This agreement    Insert:This interconnect agreement Second sentence  Upon cessation of deliveries of gas through the Interconnect: We need to put some time talbe in this agreement that it will not terminate unless we don't flow gas for a period of time. MY COMMENTS Interconnect 4th sen        Do we really want to change a definition?  Or did we accidentally define this twice? Operations  second sen    NO-  It is HPLC that will be nominating the gas, so why would we try to balance with a nom that they are not making as the PURCHASER.  The buy/sell agreement should handle the volume in the attachment of a confirm that will go out as the deals are negotiated over a short term basis. 
Just a reminder, guys.  Keep your calendars open! Mark 
Hello fellow Rice Alums (and other generous benefactors)! It's that time again.....Rice 1999 Homecoming.  And we all know what that means, don't we?..... That's right, the complete and utter chaos at the Tenth Annual Bump, Stan, Kirk, Tim, Hugh, Mark2 and Jim??Rice Homecoming Tailgate Party?= ?The day:  Saturday, November 13, 1999??The time:  10:00 am till the beer's= gone (plan on using your headlights?when?you leave)??Where:  Rice Stadium = Parking Lot--Entrance 12 off of Rice Boulevard??The game:  Uh, I think we'r= e playing tackle football in that big stadium?thingie at 1 pm, but I haven'= t bothered to find out against who yet (or for?the last nine years either).= ??But, as you all know, we do this without the help of the University (well= ,?okay, this year they're supplying Veldtman).  So why are you getting this= ?message??.....?.....?.....?We need you!??As we move from renegade tailgate= rs to officially recognized renegade?tailgaters, we find ourselves with the= peculiar circumstance of having to?pre-fund the party, leaving behind the = treasured Rice tradition of begging?money from the party participants at th= e party itself.??We hate this.

Lal,  Attached is the form agreement that was attached as Exhibit B to the LLC Agreement. Have you reviewed the Change Order form for the Compressor and Plant?  I have not heard back from Andy either.  Please let me know if you have any comments. 
I am sending you some handwritten comments to this version.  I am going home the rest of the day.  If this is something that has to be sent out today, incorporate these comments in any new version.  Otherwise lets talk about it tommorrow. Mark Knippa 11/07/99 02:52 PM 
Gerald, (its Sunday and this is what I have) Davis is going to make some changes that he and Courtney discussed yesterday in addition to some more equipment and project details.  He will likely do that tonight at home so we will send an updated draft in the moring. Defining the LLC stuff to them is not going to happen and will be removed from this document before packaging for Eastman. The Force Majuere and other sections are going to be difficult to sell to Eastman and we are going to need to work on that portion tomorrow. Have a great day. 
GT,  I won't be able to come in for the game this weekend.  I am taking a scuba diving class and I have open water dives on both Saturday and Sunday. I am kinda pissed off at myself that I didn't realize this when I signed up for the class but now I am committed.  I will still sell the tickets to your brother and nephew if they want them though.  I can FEDEX the tickets to you by Friday or worst case, just have the ticket office leave passes for the seats at will call.  Let me know.

G, How's it going? Are you ready for some football? The tailgate is going to be another wild one. Hey, my brother and nephew are coming into town. Do you want to sell your tickets for a c-note and sit with me again? Also, what day are you coming in? Let me know. GT

Neta,   I understand you currently have an agreement in place with Jomax Construction.  Enron Midstream Services, L.L.C. wants to do an affiliate work order under the existing agreement.  Can you email the details on the agreement and forward a copy of the agreement.  I will use the form of 
Ah yes!  A mini 2 year old cheese burger.  Why should that cause problems? Ryan.F.Ruppert@EXXON.sprint.com on 11/11/99 10:57:26 AM 
I again reviewed the storage contracts on which large value has been assessed.  The Cove Point LNG, Limited Partnership and Egan Hub Partners, L.P. are both FERC regulated entities and both agreements have negotiated rates. The Cove Point deal has a negotiated reservation charge and the Egan Hub Partners has a negotiated storage reservation and injection charge.  Since we are buying the assets of Columbia and assigning the contracts to Enron and these deals are at less than max rates, they would be subject to reposting upon assignment and there would be no guarantee that Enron would receive these rates in a competetive bidding situation.  It is my understanding the discounts were taken into account for valuation purposes, however these discounts are at risk due to posting requirements. The remainder of the storage contracts would require consents to assign. Note: Any transport contracts with discounted rates would be subject to the same as above. I am verifying the reposting requirements with Randy Rich of Bracewell & Patterson (FERC Counsel) and he is to get back with me early this afternoon. I will let you know if anything changes. 
Dan,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of my changes.  As we discussed, the letter is now non-binding.

Larry and Lance,  The contract packages which contain the referenced agreements will be sent today.

Three problems with this Draft. 1.  In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to meet ""all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver"".  My concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our load requirements.  At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement for this station.  E.g. 10,000 HP. 2.  In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would be in-service by such date.  My draft had a date established by Enron solely and Plains would have to meet such date.  I think we need control of our in-service date without Plains prior approval.  We will be reasonable in establishing such date. 3.  Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication Equipment.  This was not in the first draft.  We need some assurance that this equipment will do the job we need it to. I would be happy to discuss these directly with Plains' attorneys at their convenience. Mark Courtney 11/24/99 01:50 PM 
How does this look to you? Mark 
Arnold,  Do you have a name and number of the Plains attorneys (or someone who has their number) so I can discuss the attached issues with them concering the Comm Agreement. 
I think you should talk to their attorney directly.  Relevant points are: 1.  This is actually a 12 MW substation. 3.  The communications are for their use only and don't really effect us except they might want to interrupt us when it is down.  That would of course be unacceptable. Enron North America Corp.

Interconnect 
Interconnect Gerald, Following is additional information about pressure differentials.  As I understand it, we are not contractually bound to deliver to Entex through MidCon if we can't get into MidCon.  Consequently, charging back third-party costs may not be an option?  Steve Schneider (who isn't around right now) is probably the best source for this information.  Nonetheless, this does not negate the fact that we might want compensation if over time one or both of these interconnects prove to be useless for a prolonged period of time due to pressure differentials. Let me know what you and Eric find out.  In the meantime. Johnnie 
Interconnect Steve / Johnnie:  As stated below in Brads ""e"" mail the range of deliverability we can expect on the MidCon Texas Interconnects is between a minimum of 75,000 MMBtu/d and the design maximum of 100,000 MMBtu/d.  I believe this answers the remaining questions.  We have provided what I believe to be overwhelming strategic as well as financial justification to building these interconnects.  Now its time to shift into approval and most importantly immediate construction.  With the construction of these interconnects I believe there is a high probability of getting a 5 year storage deal done this year.  This would greatly reduce HPL's Spread Risk. (which just in the last week has resulted in approximately $3 million in losses).  Please let me know why we can't receive approval and begin construction immediately.   Please let me know why we would not be able to have operational by January 1, 2000. 
Gerald, Following is one of the memos detailing some of the concerns about pressure differentials between HPL & MidCon. Johnnie 
Johnnie, I have a attend the A/A mentoring program this morning and won't be back till 11am. if you need me, page me, 800-608-9432. I am forwarding you this email I got from Brad last night.

Attached are drafts of the MidCon Interconnect Agreement for Deer Park and Greens Bayou.  The agreements are written with the following key points. 1.  HPL will install both meter facility to mutally agreeable specifications. 2.  HPL will own and operate the Greens Bayou Point. 3.  MidCon will own and operate the Deer Park Point. 4.  All costs to install both interconnects will be shared 50/50 by the Parties under a true up mechanism based on actual costs. 5.  Pressure committments by both Parties for 5 years, with failure to meet such committments resulting in reimbursement by the failing Party of all costs borne by the non-failing Party for that interconnect only at which the pressure committment is not met. 6.  Each Party has a right to use at all times 50% of the then available capacity at each interconnect, unless a Party fails to meet its pressure committment. Please review.

Interesting read from Fortune Magazine.  A little dated though. Copyright 1999 Time Inc. Fortune December 20, 1999 SECTION: FEATURES/TEXAS LONGHORNS; Pg. 160 LENGTH: 4639 words HEADLINE: How One College Program Runs The Business; INSIDE LONGHORN INC. BYLINE: Roy S. Johnson, Research Associate Mary Danehy BODY: Tom Hicks was beside himself. He couldn't sit in one place. And he couldn't stand. He couldn't even bear to watch at times, but the buoyant CEO and chairman of Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, the giant buyout firm, also couldn't afford to turn away, because this deal could go either way. I'm not talking about the company's pending $ 200 million bet on an Internet outfit called Teligent. That's pocket change to a business managing more than $ 11 billion in assets. This was really big. This was Saturday afternoons in the fall. This was perky cheerleaders flying through the air, and high-stepping marching bands. This was college football. This was Texas. On this autumn Saturday afternoon in Austin, the University of Texas Longhorns led powerful Nebraska with only a few minutes on the clock at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the team's newly renovated home. A win would be huge. The Cornhuskers, perennial national title contenders, were big-bully conference rivals and ranked third in the nation, while the young Longhorns were like clumsy calves still finding their legs under second-year coach Mack Brown. Hicks is a proud and generous alum (Texas Exes, they're called), and he's deep into this Hook 'em Horns thing. Two years ago he flew athletic director DeLoss Dodds to North Carolina on his private plane to woo Brown to Austin personally, and he regularly counsels the coach on management matters. He also advised Dodds about pricing, financing, and amenities when Texas built 66 posh private suites at the stadium before last season. In October he hosted a charity golf tournament in Dallas during the raucous Texas-Oklahoma weekend to benefit the school's sports programs. He owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and the NHL Dallas Stars, but Tom Hicks loves the Texas Longhorns. So it's understandable that he was a bit on edge at the Nebraska game, hosting a couple of dozen friends, relatives, and business associates in one of the glitzy new suites high above the field at the Nebraska game. Wearing a Longhorn burnt-orange shirt and surrounded by enough ice-cream bars and shrimp to satisfy an offensive line, Hicks was anxious and animated. ""Hey,"" he yelled, 
Dan,  The only other thing I can think of is taking a security interest in the assets we are financing, if we are concerned about these guys being a credit risk.  We did this with the MTG deal.

Attached is a clean and redlined versions of the Gateway and Rio Nogales with the revisions we discussed.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward to Pace.  Merry Christmas. 
Dan,  Attached is the form.  It references the agreement we are lending the money under (and Events of Default thereunder) and also needs to have exhibits prepared.  We probably also should check to see if there are any existing Security Interest in these assets.  The ones we know that we are subordinate to should be noted in the mortgage.  Shonnie has a contact in Wyoming she has used before to search the county records for any existing security interest. 
Dan,  Please review.  I will be in tommorrow morning and we can discuss and changes needed. 
You have probably done this already, but remove any reference to SCADA in the Alstom agreement. 
We are doing business as Enron Compression Services Company.  Let me know if you need anything else. Cheryl Lantz Marshall on 12/22/99 10:28:55 AM 
This memo is regarding an agreement with the following title:  ENERGY SERVICES AGREEMENT BETWEEN PLANERGY SERVICES OF HOUSTON, INC. AND ENRON COMPRESSION SERVICES COMPANY (the ""Agreement""). Enron Compression Services Company (ECS) has an agreement with Planergy by which ECS and Planergy share in the energy savings from the certain equipment at the new Bammel compression station.  The Agreement states that we ""...will forward the recorded hours of operation for the previous month to Planergy within (15) days of the 1st day of the month.""  We are currently working with Planergy and the Bammel team to design the report that will track the hours of use for the subject equipment. I would like to suggest that the Bammel team fax the recorded hours before the 15th day of the following month to those listed below: Cheryl Marshall (Asset Management)- fax 713-646-8416 Carol Carter (ECS accounting) - fax 713-646-3084 Roger Roedick (Planergy) - fax 713-468-1457 If anyone disagrees with this idea, please call Cheryl at 713-853-6250. Gerald - as it relates to the Agreement - who are we doing business as? Please let Carol Carter know also.

As part of Enron's acquisition of the wholesale unit of Columbia Energy Services, Enron North America has a Precedent Agreement with the Millennium Pipeline project.  The Precedent Agreement contains termination clauses that are date certain for January 14, 2000.  These clauses have been extended numerous times in the past.  The PA also contains a clause that gives Enron the right to terminate the agreement if FERC's Order regarding Millennium's Certificate Application is not satisfactory and acceptable to Enron.  The FERC has not acted upon Millennium's Certificate Application.  The PA also includes an ""exclusivity"" clause (Section 3.4) that we would like clarified in conjunction with extending the dates in the agreement.  Millennium would like to clarify the ""exclusivity"" clause in an interpretive letter, rather than eliminate the language from the PA.  Millennium claims that if they eliminate the language for Enron, they would have to do the same for other shippers.  Therefore, we would like to remove the ambiguity of the ""exclusivity"" clause and clarify Enron's rights through the interpretive letter.  If we cannot agree on the interpretive letter language, then we can still exercise the right to terminate the PA by deeming the FERC Order unacceptable.  The following is the language of the ""exclusivity"" clause, a rough cut that I have made for language in the interpretive letter and the clause pertaining to the FERC Order.  Could you please give me your thoughts on the interpretive letter.  We can then send the letter to the pipeline for signature by both Enron North America and Millennium. Exclusivity Clause Section 3.4  This Agreement shall constitute the exclusive agreement by which Shipper shall seek to obtain a firm natural gas transportation service with respect to Shipper's MDQ, except for agreements pursuant to which Shipper contracts for the transportation of its MDQ to and from the Millennium Project. Interpretive Letter Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3.4 of the Millennium Pipeline Project Precedent Agreement between the sponsors of the Millennium Pipeline Project and Enron North America (""Shipper""), as successor to Columbia Energy Services, Shipper is not precluded from obtaining firm or interruptible natural gas transportation services on any interstate pipeline offering services similar to the Millennium Pipeline. FERC Order Clause Section 5.1  If the FERC's order regarding Millennium's Certificate Application is not satisfactory and acceptable to Shipper in its sole discretion, then Shipper may terminate this Agreement by giving Millennium notice thereof within fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance of the FERC's order.  In the event that Millennium fails to receive approval of this Agreement from its Management Committee, to the extent required, Millennium may terminate this Agreement by giving Shipper fifteen (15) days prior notice. 
Steve, Here it is.  Enjoy. 
Let's talk. 
Kay,  Please review the attached.  Thanks. 
Tom,  I would like to attend.  The 23rd is the better date for me.  Let me know. Thanks. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Brad,  Please reviewed the attached before we send to MidCon for their review.  Pay particular attention to the pressure committment sections. Thanks. 
Steve,  Let's take out the reference to approaching the FERC in this letter. I would emphasize that they have had more than enough time for a response and while we would like to think they are cooperating, the lack of response little reason to believe otherwise.  Suggest that any further delay would require us to explore all our options for access into CMS. At this point I would feel more comfortable with suggesting we would need to go to FERC via a phone conversation with CMS.   Let me know if you want to discuss this further. Enron North America Corp. 
FYI.  Looks like it did have review after all. 
OK.  Sounds great.  Thanks for the follow-up.

GT,   That sounds great on the house. What are you remodeling?  The carpet and kitchen? I have been out chasing some myself.   It is amazing how may screwed women there are out there.  Some good looking ones though. I am out of town the next couple of weekends, but some time after that would be good.  Early February around the 12th or any time thereafter.  Sounds like you are going to be busy moving in the house during that time also.  Let me know. ""Townsend, George"" <gtownsend@manorisd.net> on 01/20/2000 07:24:21 AM

It worked,  You guys are officially online now.  Everything here is fine. I will likely have a roommate in the next couple of weeks.  A friend of mine who also works at Enron is moving back to Houston from Portland.  This will work out great and also help me with the mortgage payments. Take care and talk to you later. 
Lisa,  Attached is a spreadsheet which divides the property.  Please review and note the following: 1.  No values for the 401K's are in the sheet.   Blank at this time. 2.  The blue values can be changed and the sheet should adjust accordingly. 3.  Please review the calculations behind the cells to understand how I am calculating the values on the sheet. If you want to sit down and go over this together at your convenience, I would be happy to do so. If you find something upsetting, please call and let's discuss before you talk to anyone else.

Thanks for all your work on the trip Amy.  I'll tell Dan you deserve a big

Kay, Could you pull and send me copies of any Confidentiality Agreements any Enron entities have with the following companies: Bay Gas Storage Energy South Not sure what type of entities they are.  Let me know if you need any further 
By the time of this meeting, I will be about $10,000 richer with a 6 ft. tall half-clothed showgirl on each arm.  So please send Kristi my greetings! When upon learning I will not be in attendance, she goes into a deep state of depression, inform her that she had her chance and that ship has sailed. OK, I will reconsider, but only if she grovels. Ryan.F.Ruppert@EXXON.sprint.com on 01/25/2000 09:49:23 AM 
Kay,  Could you send me a copy of the draft of the HNG Agreement.  Thanks 
Gerald:  I don't find any executer agreements with or pertaining to either entity.  We have a draft agreement with HNG Storage about our possible financing of their purchase of Energy South, but I don't have an executed agreement - that was in September. K Gerald Nemec 01/25/2000 04:12 PM 
Kay, Could you pull and send me copies of any Confidentiality Agreements any Enron entities have with the following companies: Bay Gas Storage Energy South Not sure what type of entities they are.  Let me know if you need any further information.  Thanks for your help. 
Mark,  Please review the attached form of amendments.  I have also prepared the form of amendment for the O&M Agreements, but will hold until you get further information on the fee arrangements. After you review these forms, lets discuss and review where we are at in this whole process.  We will need to get TW, Accounting, and Investor review of these as soon as possible. 
I noticed that there was one bio missing.  So here goes, Eric Gillaspie:  28 Junior Attorney extradonaire for Enron North America, wannabe Rock-n-Roll star.  Prone to performing at least one incredibly embarassing act every time he goes out drinking including, but not limited to, falling down in bars, kicking people on the dance floor with his incredibly gay dance steps, and lapsing into siezures resulting in the tossing of a full Gin&Tonic on senior attorneys.  Often mistaken for the cute little guy in the movie ""Jerry Maguire"" (Dogs and Bees can smell fear) not only because of his looks, but also his level of speech and depth of conversation.  Thinks the Rolling Stones stole all of their best material from BuckCherry and finally, ""Our  dive captain"". Ryan.F.Ruppert@EXXON.sprint.com on 01/27/2000 12:39:30 PM 
Jim,  Attached are the interconnect agreements for the MidCon Flagstaff (formerly Greens Bayou) and Deer Park points.  The pressure of 550 psig is in the Flagstaff agreement.  Please review and if acceptable please forward to MidCon.

Las Vegas was alot of fun.  The weather was awesome.  In the 60s with clear skies.  However, I had no luck at gambling.  The cards just weren't falling for me in Black Jack. Yes, a friend of mine from Enron is moving back to Houston from Portland, so this is working out great.  Very close to getting the divorce finalized. Should be done in a week or two.  Talk to you later and hope all finds you well. ""Edward Nemec"" <ednemec@earthlink.net> on 01/30/2000 09:38:32 PM 
Hi Gerald,      How's it going?  Fine I hope. We are all O.K. It""s been cold the last few days. So you are going to have a roommate.  That ought to help you out a lot, plus you""ll have some company. I heard you went to Las Vegas over the weekend. Did you have fun. How much did you win .  Was the weather cold or not. Talked to Paul Saturday and he said you went there. So is there any progress on your divorce or not. Let us know what is happening. Well all for now Dad and I send our love.    Love  Mom. 
Pat, I will be out the 4, 7, and 8th of Feb.

Attached is a draft for your review.  Please review and lets discuss any comments. After re-reading the purchase and gathering agreement, I think the amendments should work in their present form.  The 2,500 Western gas needs to be noted as an exception on Exhibits A of both Agreements.   Exception should read ""Up to the first 2,500 mmbtu/day of production from the Caballo Area shall be delivered to Western.... with ENA  (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) receiving all volumes in excess of such 2,500 mmbtu/day.  Any decline in the Caballo Area production shall apply ratably between Western's 2,500 mmbtu/day and ENA's (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) production

Nice job on the photos.   Really makes me realize how drunk I was at certain times.  The good thing is that the ""Dude"" I met in Joe's and I are now pen pals and he will be coming to Houston to visit very soon.  Maybe he was my long lost brother.  I am making a phone call to my Mom right now too see if 
Steve,  Do you have an executed copy of the Trunkline Confidentiality Agreement for the LNG terminal in Lake Charles?  Need to get one for our files.  Thanks. 
That's not funny! 
Revision:  HPL will operate to the outlet flange of the regulation (not separation) equipment as reflected on Jim's drawing that will be Exhibit A. 
I have talked to Dan McWhirter with CPS and the agreement needs to altered to reflect the following, as needed.  HPL will construct a tap, tap valve, riser, and check valve off the South Texas 30"" JV pipeline, with EFM and SCADA equipment on the meter facilities.  We will own, operate and maintain such facilities , but will be reimbursed (with IRS tax gross-up) by CPS. Ownership will break at the outlet flange of the check valve, plus the EFM and SCADA equipment.  CPS will construct and own the remainder of the facilities installed, such facilities to the outlet flange of the separation facilities (including tank and secondary containment)  being installed to HPL's specs.  HPL will operate and maintain these facilities.  Our EFM will be custody transfer, with their EFM being check measurement.  Such facilities are to be installed so that HPL remotely controls the volume flow through the meter.  All maintenance costs on this sector will be paid by HPL and reimbursed by CPS upon invoice.  Any maintenance expenditure over $3,000 per event will require pre-notification to CPS.  All other facilities downstream of separation with be constructed, owned, operated and maintained by CPS.  As compensation for handling the separation facilities and liquids recovered, CPS pre-transfers ownership and title to such recovered liquids to HPL and warrants title to HPL.  Jim Haden will provide a revised Exhibit A depicting the facilities and the ownership break point.  Jim, you need to review and approve the facilities to be installed above to our specifications, as required.  If you have any questions, please call. 
It is all about drinking with you isn't it?  You need to get a grip.   I will have to pass on the Rudz Suds as I will be dining at one of Houston's finer eateries with captains of industry tonight.  However, Eric and I were kicking around a possible road trip to the beautiful island of Galveston this weekend.  Saturday or Sunday? Think that nice friend of yours, Willis, might be interested? Please respond appropriately with your level of interest!  Just to anticipate the tone of your response, I will go ahead and call you a ""Smart Ass"" right now.

It is showing up on my computer and seems to be working. 
Upon reading the e:mail message shown below, I immediatedly went to Start/Programs/Infobasis and I found no WINFASTER application.  The applications that were available were Croporate Workbook 3.0c & 4.1, Disclosure, Enron Corporate Datasheets, Gas and Power Daily Web Page and Phone Book. Given that I requested and Joya Davis processed the request for the FASTR Database for me, Gerald Nemec and Shonnie Daniel in early January, it is really a shame that so many people's time has been wasted with this matter. Please figure out why the program is not showing up on my computer.  Is it showing up on Gerald's and Shonnie's? Felix Buitron 02/16/2000 11:31 AM 
FYI 
Hello Felix, Just following up regarding FASTR ,    I spoke with Kevin Hopper and he said that the WINFASTR is the application he is looking for. it is under Start / Programs / Infobasis.   He is in the group. Thanks ! Sandra Hart Information Risk Management 
RFP,   I had a good time also.  The bands were interesting though.  I bet that dude in the helmet sweated his ass off during the performance. The date was actually  her call.  We are meeting some of her friends out for dinner and drinks and then some sweet sweet love.  Seriously, this girl is cool and a lot of fun.  Should be a good time.  Of course I am assuming that the date is still on.  In my clear thinking state last night when I left Rudz (a la 1 pm) I called her and woke her up.   I really have no idea what I said to her.  She may not be speaking to me anymore. What was with Willis last night?  No show! Let's circle the wagons this afternoon to discuss Galveston. Ryan.F.Ruppert@EXXON.sprint.com on 02/18/2000 07:48:55 AM 
Jaime,  Attached is a firm sales agreement form which ECT utilizes in  North America.  A lot of the form may not be relevant given the fact that (i) Pemex is both the seller and transporter and (ii)  unless you are near the border, there are no alternative sources to Pemex.  However, it is a good starting point.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
I'm sorry.  Eric and I aren't speaking at the moment due to creative differences.  I want only the orange M&M's removed from our dressing room and he wants only the brown ones removed. Ryan.F.Ruppert@EXXON.sprint.com on 02/18/2000 09:05:55 AM 
Attached is Exhibit C to the Gallup O&M Agreement.  The original document left this Exhibit to follow later.   We also still owe you Exhibit B (Description of Compressor Motor Facilities) to the O&M Agreement and Exhibit B to the CSA (Proposed form of No. 21 Schedule).  These will follow shortly. 
Attached for your review is the letter agreement which locks in the Gas Conversion Agreement pricing. 
Sounds like a good trip if there are spaces available.  I think our dive captain is checking availability.  Of course our dive captain is also hesitant about being swallowed whole by a Whale Shark.  I told him that with a house to remodel that would probably be a blessing. Let us know what your schedule is.  See if we can't hook up Thursday or Friday for lunch.  I open and I am sure Nacious E would be too. Ryan.F.Ruppert@EXXON.sprint.com on 02/23/2000 09:54:03 AM 
True.  Especially after I cut E's fat plump rump roast with my dive knife to chum the waters a little.  Let's shoot for Friday for lunch.  Maybe I go back to work after that or maybe I don't.  No other three Czech brothers can cruise so successfully in tight slacks! Things are going well with little Cynthia.  She is really fun and easy to talk to.  I am not sure what my intentions are right now but we enjoy each others company. Ryan.F.Ruppert@EXXON.sprint.com on 02/23/2000 01:34:52 PM

Further to my earlier e-mail, attached is updated information for meeting on accounting issues.  Regards, NJD 
Tracy, Thanks for the pictures.  Cute kid.  Frank does look like you.  I need to come by and see Frank in person.  Sorry that I have been out of the loop for some time but sometimes life is weird. I am sure Tom told you that Lisa and I are getting divorced.  It is still hard for me to comprehend this, but all I can do is continue to move forward with my life.  Anyway, hope to see you guys soon sometime and keep sending pictures. Gerald ""fillip"" <fillip@gateway.net> on 02/24/2000 08:33:46 AM Please respond to ""fillip"" <fillip@gateway.net>

Yes I am!  Let me know what time you are available and where you are this week and I will pick an appropriate location.   G$ and Nacious E are available. You need a nickname too.  Let's ponder this one and submit ideas. Ryan.F.Ruppert@EXXON.sprint.com on 02/24/2000 09:13:20 AM 
Let's plan on meeting at the Original Tila's (not Teala's) on Kirby right where the road curves before it heads down to Allen Parkway.  Around 11:45 am? As far as nicknames go: Punchy RyDog Steel Nipple Cherry Vodka The Ambassador Sling (you will sing all our Police cover tunes) R-Bomb

Mark,  Attached is a draft of the power agreement with my changes redlined in.  I still have a few more, but wanted to get the majority of these to you asap.  Targeting Monday to forward to CDEC. 
Everything is going well.  Sorry I haven't gotten back to you, but I have been really busy at work and with other things.  I will give a call when I get a chance. ""Edward Nemec"" <ednemec@earthlink.net> on 02/23/2000 10:08:08 PM 
Hi Gerald,           How are things going. Fine I hope we are all O.K. I called the other night and left a message just wanted to talk voice mail for a  change.!!!!!!!! Have been busy working in the yard. Had to trim all the shrubs and get rid of all the dead plants.    So what have you been doing. Anything new going on with you. James started planting this week. He is trying to get that moisture before it drys out.  We didn't get  any rain today again.  Starting to look bad.  I'm keeping Jenna and Jake tomorrow. Janice has a doctors appoitment. Nothing serous just a follow up. Got ashort email from Paul yesterday he's doing o.k...........Well all for now Dad and I send our love....Bye for now. Love...MOM 
Attached is a clean and redline version with my changes.  I made a few further refinements to the agreement.  I think it would be a good idea to walk CDEC through these changes as a lot of these are form not substance. 
Mark,  Please disregard the prior versions and review this one.  This includes Section 1.4 which requires CDEC to provide us access with the load projection systems that are in place. 
Delivery 
FYI 
Delivery Please find attached the cost estimate for the subject project.  In addition, please find out from the deal maker the correct Income Tax Gross-Up Charge. I will include the Income Tax Gross-Up charge in the total cost on the Work Order Authorization as soon as you let me know the percentage.  If you have any questions, please feel free to drop by. Thanks, Rodney 
Gerald, Please review the attached list below for an existing MSA contract.  Also, please establish an MSA contract with each contractor that does not already have one.

Jeff; Here's the bidders list as it stands now.  We have contacted the bidders listed and confirmed the name and address for each. Let me know if you need anything else. Ken - RFQ Address LIst.xls 
Janet,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Confidentiality Agreement (Trunkline) with the revisions we discussed.  Please review.  Bobby Gaspard with Trunkline, asked that I forward the revised draft via email and after their review an executable.  Please forward to Bobby for his review at bjgaspard@cmsenergy.com if you are okay with this draft. 
Looks like we got another one.  Sounds like we duplicate the agreement we create for Ginger and use for this interconnect.  Let's discuss when we get a chance. 
Hello!  I have been told that you are the interconnect guru.  I think I called you a couple of weeks ago with a warning on this one.  What information do you need from me to get started on an interconnect agreement with Tejas?  The purpose of this interconnect is to deliver 2-3 days of gas while we lower the line that feeds the city of Kingsville.  In addition, we will keep the interconnect in place as back-up to the city.  Please read the attached memo for additional details.  Please note that we would like to have this project completed within 3 weeks. 
Per Billy Sheilds at Tejas, the cost for a 3"" meter and tap is $ 27,000. The estimate does not include separation, regulation or site with fencing which Tejas is expecting HPL to provide. To proceed, the field people need to meet and agree upon the details, and a contract needs to be entered into for all gas delivered from Tejas to HPL at this point. All cost incurred for the meter installation is reimbursable to Tejas. 
Well it looks like Eric is now officially burden with an oppressive mortgage.  Won't be long before he is out mowing the lawn in Bermuda short and sandals with black socks.  Eventually all the good ones go down. What up with you, JT? 
Jeff,  Attached is the form with some modifications.  Please see that this is the form utilized for all releases in the future.  Please call me if you have any questions.  (713) 853-3512 
Here they are. 
Attached are the following documents for initial review.  The services agreement (rockmsa-mastermac.) is between HPLC and Meter Aquisition, and the services agreement (rockmsa-stone.) is between Meter Aquisition and Hanover Measurement Services Company (our Stone entity). Also attached is a revised distribution list.  Please call Pat Radford at 853-9282 with additional addresses or phone numbers or corrections to the list. I will be out of the office from June 14 to July 4.  In my absence coordinate related matters with Barbara Gray and Lance Schuler. 
Attached is a clean and redlined version the agreement with our revisions. 
Ken,  This is the complete document.  The schedule are attached to it. 
Stephanie,  I forwarded a hard copy of the operational control letter yesterday.  Let me know if you don't have it.  Attached is the price letter. There is no formal contract in place between TW and EE&CC for the construction.  Both TW and ECS as I understand, have signed AFE's with EE&CC for the projects.  We will most likely have to address this risk in the Contribution Agreement.  I will talk with Mark and Mark about this. PPA- we are expecting comments back from CDEC late today.  Schedule is now to review their comments and meet with them Tuesday (via phone or in person) to finalize.  We can likely get Patti a copy after Tuesday. Contribution Agreement - Pending resolution of the construction risk issues, we can have a draft for Patti early next week. 
TW has the final draft, since they prepared the document.  I have asked for it via email.  As soon as I receive I will forward.  Thanks. Enron Global Finance 
Here it is.

Can't I say Hello to Mandy without a specific reason for doing so?  Actually, you copied me on a joke email earlier in the week.  Just thought I would see if you would talk to me. Mandy.Bowles@email.moore.com 12/15/2000 01:50 PM 
still no word on the Hawaii job yet -- Just got word that I'm number one pick for the Pennzoil job, but that they wouldn't be ready to do anything until after the first of the year, which is fine by me. I'm going to London 1/10 through 1/16 - did I tell you that arleady? so, you didn't answer my question:  what made you say hello all of a sudden?  I thought you were gone for good.
