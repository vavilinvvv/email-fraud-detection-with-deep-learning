Hello everyone: Just a reminder if you have not registered yet, please do so today. Have a great day! Shirley You are invited to attend the following presentation: PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group. ?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. ?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such as Full Requirement  and load following contract. ?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals. ?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues. In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

Hello all: According to the email below, we are going to have to bill your cell phone= =20 invoices to your credit cards and receive reimbursement on an expense=20 report. If you want me to do this, I will be glad to - I will just need your credit= =20 card number that you want it billed to.  I think it will only have to be done on= e time and then they will automatically bill it to your card. Let me know. Thanks! Shirley 
The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe= w=20 years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increa= se=20 in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20 reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle. Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20 employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times= =20 they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes= e=20 cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, = we=20 try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20 employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20 increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20 productive than paying invoices. To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa= ry=20 for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and= =20 other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay= =20 for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc= tions=20 are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20 employee expense reports.=20 By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce= =20 the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of= =20 checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th= e=20 turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20 
Good morning Tom: Please furnish the following information to me for the Research Directory: Name:   Tom Halliburton Title: Location:  EB1957 Phone#:  5-8539 Home Address: Home Telephone: Wife's Name: Your Birthday: Also for your information, there will be a Research Group Staff Meeting every Thursday from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM in EB 30C1.  Lunch will be provided. Please let me know what kind of sandwich or salad you would like and what you would like to drink. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 
HI Brad: I am it for our group!  However, it might be a good idea to train Sam Smith also. Please let us know. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 
Hi Mark: Please order an 800 MHZ machine with 512 MB of RAM, and a large (17""+) flat-screen monitor for Clayton Vernon.  Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is 100038.  (is the large screen a 17"" or a 20""?) If you need anything else, please let me know. Thanks Mark and have a great day! Shirley 3-5290 
Shirley, Yes, It will be  a swap of one machine for another. Vince Shirley Crenshaw 03/17/2000 12:17 PM 
Vince: Is this ok to order? 
Mark- Shirley will order an 800 MHZ machine with 512 MB of RAM, and a large (17""+) flat-screen monitor for me. Clayton Mark Davidson 03/17/2000 08:52 AM 
Clayton- Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  There are a couple of things to keep in mind: -Enron IT supports Enron equipment. 
Mark- I have developed a model for Enron that requires ultra-high-end PC performance (it does many calculations in Excel), and my boss has authorized me to buy whatever PC I need. I'm looking at the Compaq 850, but Richard (our floor rep) says no PC's over the 600 series will be supported by IT. I need to resolve this issue; we are sophisticated buyers, we know the type of machine we want, and we have the money to pay for it. Sincerely, Clayton Vernon Manager, Research 
Vince: I have left Brad two messages at this cell phone # - he has not responded. Any suggestions? Vince J Kaminski 03/16/2000 08:58 AM 
Shirley, I have his cell phone: 650 814 9966. Vince Shirley Crenshaw 03/13/2000 02:15 PM 
Vince: Do you have a current address for Brad? 
Shirley, is there any possibility that you might have an updated current address for Brad?  If not, would Vince know? Thanks much, Carol 
Hello Nick: I agree  e-mail is much easier. There is a two-hour time difference between Calif and Texas, i.e., 1:00 pm Texas Time - 11:00 am Calif time. Would tomorrow at 11:00 am Calif time be ok with you (1:00 pm Texas)? This time is fine for Vince, Tom Gros and Stinson Gibner. Can they call you and if so, what number? Please let me know. Thanks! Shirley 713-853-5290 Nick Bambos <bambos@stanford.edu> on 03/16/2000 12:28:58 PM 
Shirley, It's easier to communcate by e-mail, since I am moving from meeting to meeting (but I have the laptop always with me). Please give me a phone number that I could call tomorrow. What is the time difference between California and your location? I think it's 2 hours (CA->TX) - is that right? I can do the conference call any time from 9-11 CA time. Would that be OK on your side?

Vince: Michael Crew would like you to be a speaker on Wednesday, May 23rd instead of the 24th at the Rutgers Conference.  Is this ok? He is preparing the agenda and needs to know as soon as possible. Shirley 
Shirley, This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there for the Wednesday. I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince. We will show Vince's name as follows: Wincety J. Kaminski Managing Director - Research ENRON Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately. We would like to go to press today.  Failing that we can go to press tomorrow.  We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any corrections or changes.  If you would respond to all of us it would be appreciated. Michael Michael A.

I have recently come on board as Treasurer ,Enron India . Prior to joining , I was with Reliance Industries , a petrochemical conglomerate in India. The  Central banking authorities are now thinking of permitting corporates  to hedge their oil and other related risks. I believe the literature published by Risk in collaboration with Enron has come to be considered as an industry standard. Would it be possible to arrange for two copies to be sent across to us .

Good morning all: Maureen Raymond Castaneda is officed in EB1939.  She has terrible migraine headaches which are made worse by light.  We would like to get a price on having an on/off switch installed in her room.  As of now, they have removed the light bulbs, but said that may not completely answer the problem as some one may see that they are out and request they be replaced. I think the answer (if it is not too expensive) would be to have a switch installed. Please let me know. Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is 100038. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 
Connie: In response to your email to Vince Kaminski of 3/19/01, the subject invoice was sent to our Accounting Dept. for payment on February 25, 2001.  We did not need the SPAV maintenance, so we deducted $1,600.00.  Did you receive a payment in the amount of $4100.00 that could possibly have been payment for this invoice? I have left a message for our accounting dept. to see exactly when the invoice was paid and the check number.  As soon as I hear from them I will left you know.

Good morning all: The question has arisen as to whether Enron has ""personal days"", that, you can take in case of repair problems at home; car problems; sick spouse, sick child, etc. I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is ""no"", but they can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor.  I talked this over with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed two (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business and not have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence. If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled), please let me know when you are going to take these days.  If an emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you are taking a personal day.  It will be coded on your time sheet. These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, ""funeral leave"", ""family leave"", or ""civic duty leave"".  They are just a way of being able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise. These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by all of us. If you have any questions, please call me. Shirley 3-5290

Good afternoon Sandeep: I sent Krishna's expenses for his recent trip to our accounting dept. this morning and expensed them to the Research Group's Co and RC#. However, we need to be reimbursed for these expenses and I would like to know the best way to do this.  Our accounting dept. thought we should just send an invoice with the back up material to Dabhol Power Co. asking them to cut a check made payable to Enron Corp. and then it would be credited to our Co# and RC#. Please let me know if this is acceptable, and if so, who the invoice should be made out to and where I should send it. I appreciate your assistance in this matter. Have a great day!

Hi Shirley, I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not enough memory.  Twice I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me.

Hi Iain: Got a questions for you?  We have a small copier in our Research area (a Minolta CSPro)  that stays on the blink somewhere, quite a bit of the time.  The temporary copier in 19K1 is a Kodak Image Source 50.  What is the difference in price of these two copiers?  Is there any way we could exchange the Minolta for the Image Source when you bring our permanent copier to 19K1? Please let me know.  We would like to do that if we can and it is not too much more money. Thanks and have a great day! Shirley

Dear Vince, As the holidays approach, I am excited by my coming break from classes but also about the opportunity to see everyone at Enron again and to work with you and them soon.  I am writing to let you know that I would be very happy to work at Enron over my break and I would like to plan out a schedule. My semester officially ends Dec. 20th but I may be out of town the week before Christmas.  I will be available the following three weeks, from Monday, Dec. 27 to Friday, Jan. 14.  Please let me know if during those three weeks, you would like me to work and for what dates you would need the most help so that we can arrange a schedule that would be most helpful to you and so that I can contact Andrea at ProStaff soon. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions about a possible work schedule for me. Give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very happy holiday season!  I look forward to seeing you soon. Sincerely, Van Ngo Ph: 713-630-8038 - att1.htm 
Good morning all.  We apologize that we are not going to be able to have our Holiday Party before the first of the year.

Iris: I forwarded the information to Donna Lowry in our Compliance Dept.  However, I am afraid she had bad news. Enron would sponsor the renewals, but the US Securities group does not recognize UK Securities exams without further testing here in the US. She said she would get back with you and explain it in greater detail.  But, from what I understand, you will need to take some exam here before renewing. When you hear from her let me know.

Frank: I discussed this with Vince Kaminski and he said that, while we would be glad to assist you, the time involved in ordering and collecting the money (they are pretty expensive), distributing the books, etc. would be too time consuming for us at this time. You can go to www.lacimagroup.com and order the books directly.  Tell them you are ordering the books for use at Enron and they should give you a 15% discount. I am sorry that we cannot do this at this time.

As we had discussed in our phone conversation Friday, I would ask you to order six copies of the newly Enron-published ""Energy Derivatives"" for Paradigm Strategy Group.  We do the various derivatives training courses for Enron, and this book will be required reading for all our instructors. Please advise as to the total cost of the books.  If payment by check is OK, please let me know to whom the check should be made payable. You can reach me by e-mail, or phone at 281-360-7822. Thanks for your help. Frank Ribeiro Paradigm

Kim: The interviews conducted on February 2 are just exploratory interviews to see where Punit might fit within Enron.  Vince thought he might fit in John's group. The title and $$ amount will not be determined until it is decided where he should be (if at all).  If John is interested after the interview, then he and Vince can get together to discuss $$ and title. If you or John have any other questions, please let me know. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 
Shirley, It is to my understand that Vince is bringing in Punit for a day of interviews.  John has agreed to meet with him on February 2. Please inform Vince and have Vince get with John on what his title/$$ will be.

Hi Molly: Punit Rawal is a Carnegie Mellon student that Kevin Kindall and Bob Lee interviewed back in December.  We would like to bring him in for an interview.  He is definately a ""Trading support"" prospect. I forwarded his resume to John Lavorato back in December and inquired as to whether he would be interested in interviewing him or not, but have had no response, except that he has not had a chance to look at his resume yet. Vince originally said that either John or Gary Hickerson might be interested. I did not send his resume to Gary, maybe you can check with him? I am attaching the Interview request form and his resume.  Thanks! Shirley

Vince: I was confused also - but I think this is the computer we ordered for the new employee that is coming next week (Rakesh Bharati).  Phillip our IT floor tech said that the computer in the back room at EB1972G was very old and did not have much memory so I ordered a new one with an upgrade to bring it up to 196M (this is what Phillip said we need).  Also there is another computer back there that does not have much memory and we ordered an upgrade for it (Jason's).  I went ahead an did it so that they would be ready when the new employees come in. Maureen already has her upgrade. Shirley Vince J Kaminski 12/18/2000 03:58 PM 
Shirley, Is this an upgrade for Maureen? Vince

Shirley, Can you reserve the room for Tue, Dec 19, 3:30? Vince 
Vince- George just ""remembered"" the traders' meetings Monday and Wednesday afternoons at 3:30. He' s going to email you- I think Tuesday would ensure a turnout of traders as well as analysts. We  could easily have 20 people there from Power alone, and there's always Gas .... When you decide the time,  can you ask Shirley to reserve a conference room along the size of 30C1? Clayton

Shirley,  I just talked to you over the phone and here is the information: The adjustment total is $135.6. NNG receives a credit of $109 and TW $(26.6).  Pls make sure it gets into the December business.  Thanks. 
Krishna, Attached is a spreadsheet with the figures we discussed earlier.  For July-Dec, ETS will keep half of the amount allocated (equivalent to 1.5 employees, $135.6) from the corporate allocations to ETS.  If this looks OK to you, I would like to have Vera work with Shirley to handle the accounting adjustment similar to mid year.  Many thanks, Kim. Vera, Here is the Year 2000 spreadsheet.  As you will see, we will need to work with Shirley Crenshaw (X35290) with Enron Research Group to coordinate a similar accounting adjustment to the one we made mid year.  I will send the Year 2001 Budgeted spreadsheet to you in the next few days (just in case it changes with the approval of the science workorder).  Please call me if you have any questions about this spreadsheet.  Thanks, Kim. 
Hi Anne: Attached is an updated Research org chart (with the exception of Stinson Gibner's group). As soon as I get his update I will send it. Thanks! Shirley 
Vince: Did you get the below email from Jim Garven? Would you be able to stay over and speak at the Risk Management Fraternity and perhaps come in a day early and speak to his students? Shirley 
Dear Ms. Crenshaw, On November 28, I sent Vince Kaminski an email inviting him to visit Baylor University (where I now hold an appointment as Professor of Finance & Insurance; having resigned from LSU this pas spring).? I have yet to receive a reply from him.? Can you bring this email (copied below) to his attention? Thanks, Jim Garven =========================== Dear Vince, Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX. My colleague at Baylor, John Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on Friday, February 23 that he is organizing. I am curious whether your schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a national risk management fraternity. For that matter, would you also possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)? What I have in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU classes. Thank you for your consideration of this request. I am looking forward to seeing you once again. Sincerely, Jim Garven _________________________________________ James R.

Hi Sandy: Yes he does.  Actually in our group meeting today, Vince Kaminski said that he wants most of his group to have access.  I believe Stinson Gibner is working on the list.  Is there a way we could submit a request to incorporate a list of people to give them access?  They would need writing access also. Thanks! Shirley 
Norma: Ted Murphy would like to have Jason removed from his cost center effective  December 16th.  Vince said that it would be ok to have him added to our cost center, effective that date.  He is not supposed to start with the Research Group until the 28th, but needs a home from the 16th to the 28th, so we will pick him up. Can you take care of this? Thanks! Shirley

Ms. Crenshaw, Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end, please let me know. Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your colleagues.

Hi Samer! Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving! I found out the ""scoop"" on the ticket.  It was non-refundable and non- refundable tickets cannot be transferred.  It was just your seat that Maureen's husband used. I will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $330.50. The best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for the check from us. Sorry for the confusion! Cheers! Shirley ""Samer Takriti"" <takriti@us.ibm.com> on 11/20/2000 01:41:23 PM 
Shirley, How are you? Things are fine over here. We are still trying to settle in; this process seems to be taking forever. I would like to ask for your help. I have received a statement from American Express related to my Enron account. The charge amount is $330.50, which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket. After calling the Travel Agency in the Park, I found out that this was the ticket that I was supposed to have used to fly to Colorado. However, the ticket was used by Maurine's husband and Maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket. Also, I remember calling the TAP and cancelling prior to the travel date. Can you help me figure out what is going on here? I am not sure who is supposed to pay for this. I disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected. I appreciate your help. Thanks. -Samer

Good morning all: Below is an email from Kevin Sweeney inquiring about a software demo that he thought might have been in our group.  If anyone had this demo, please let Vince know. Thanks! Shirley 
Vince, I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past. Thanks, Kevin 
Kevin: I do not know who half of these people are!

Hello Kenneth: Nice talking to you this morning!  Below is your interview schedule for Monday, Oct. 30th and directions to the Enron Bldg..  Please let me know if you need any travel arrangements made. Coming from the northwest part of Houston, your best bet would be to take I-45 into town.  There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you will probably have to take the McKinney exit from I-45 (you will need to stay in the left lane as you approach town.  Exit McKinney to Smith Street, take a right on Smith Street go to Andrews Street, take a right on Andrews (the Enron bldg. is on the left), pass the Enron Bldg. cross ""Ruthvan"" (1st stop sign) and pull into the Allen Center Parking garage (Visitors area on your right).  Come to the security desk on the 1st floor of the Enron Bldg. and ask for me.  They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby on the 19th floor. Monday, October 30th 9:00 AM  Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research 9:30 AM  Zimin Lu, Director 10:00 AM Vasant, Vice President 10:30 AM Krishna Krishnarao, Director 11:00 AM Paulo Issler, Manager 11:30 AM Stinson Gibner (He will take you to lunch) 1:00 PM  Molly McGee (HR Recruiter) Have a safe trip.

Gwyn: Just because the A/A program does not have a contract does not mean that Enron does not.  Do you have a telephone number for Melly's and I will call them directly and ask her if she has a contract. Thanks! Shirley Gwyn Koepke@ENRON 10/23/2000 04:22 PM 
Vince, The A/A program does not have a contract in place with Melly Language Services.  It appears that by the note below from my contact in the A/A-HR department, the reimbursement policy appears to be driven by department, not Enron at large. As I mentioned earlier, if I continue with my current tutor, but outside of the Melly Language Services, the cost to the department will decrease for me to take French classes. Pls advise if Research will be able to continue to fund my lessons. Many thanks, Gwyn Koepke 
Mark: Good to hear from you!  I think it is a good idea for you to talk to Maureen Raymond-Castaneda, Enron's Chief Economist or Dr. Vince Kaminski, Managing Director and Head of Research.   Unfortunately both are out of the office at present.  Maureen will return on Monday, the 23rd and Vince will return on Wednesday, the 25th. If you will be available for a telephone call on Wednesday, the 25th, please let me know when and the telephone number and I will arrange the telephone interview.

Sharon/Carol: Jeremy Blachman called Vince Kaminski and requested a meeting to discuss additional Research support for EES, as soon as possible.  The participants in this meeting would be: Jeremy Blachman Marty Sunde Vince Kaminski Krishna Krishnarao The soonest Vince and Krishna are available would be Thursday, October 26 at the following times: 9:00 - 10:00 AM 1:00 - 3:00 PM and Friday, October 27th: 8:30 - 10:30 AM 1:00 - 2:30 PM Please let me know what time would be  best for Marty and Jeremy.

Hello everyone: Vince would like to bring Jaesoo Lew in next week for an exploratory interview with the Research Group.  The dates that would work best for us are: Wednesday, the 25th (AM), Thursday, 26th  (AM) and Friday, 27th (AM).  Please see if Mr. Lew is available for any of these times. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 - vitae2.doc 
Shirley, I would like to  invite him to an interview next week. We should use his home phone number and/or private E-mail address. Vince 
Dear Dr. Kaminski My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee. Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach. The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++ programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too. I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron. My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Jaesoo Lew _________________________________________________________________________ Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.

The Research Group: It is with a deep sense of regret that I announce that Grant Masson will be leaving the Research Group and Enron, effective today. Grant has been a very important part of the Research Group's growth and stability within Enron and he will be deeply missed. We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with all the ""good"" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the ""Good Luck and Best Wishes"" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An announcement will be forthcoming at a later date. Please take a minute to wish Grant the ""Best"". Sincerely, Vince

fyi 
Shirley, Thank you for your e-mail, I hope all has turned out well with Vince and his family. This is my first day back in the office, so the reason for contacting you is to acknowledge receipt of your note and to inquire as to when Vince will next be in the UK. Please contact me at you convenience, ALLAN 
Allen: I apologize!  I tried to call on the numbers below, but they would not go through.  I sent you an email explaining why Vince was not there, unfortunately it did not get to you in time! Vince's wife and son were driving to California for his junior year at Stanford. They stopped in Phoenix and his wife got sick.  Vince is afraid he will have to fly out there and drive them on to Calif. Please accept our deepest apologies and we will reschedule for October, if it is ok. Regards, Shirley Crenshaw allan.roberts@uk.arthurandersen.com on 09/18/2000 09:08:15 AM 
Dear Shirley, My colleagues and I were expecting to lunch with Vince today. Unfortunately, Vince did not show.

If you need to contact me urgently, please call me on +44 370 584 695, or my EA Angela on +44 7304 8102.

Professor Martin: Attached is Vince's itinerary.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
John, I shall be in Paris and London next week. We can schedule a call sometimes next week. I shall ask my assistant to send you my itinerary. A late call (Paris time) would work for me. The time difference is 6 hours. This would mean a call sometimes around 3 - 4 p.m. our time. Please, indicate which day works best for you. Vince ""John D. Martin"" <J_Martin@baylor.edu> on 09/27/2000 09:45:50 AM 
Vince, Good morning.  Unfortunately I'll be in Milwaukee visiting Harley-Davidson about a book revision project both Thursday and Friday.  How about early next week.  I appreciate your patience with me.  When you suggested a time last week I was ""unprepared"" and embarassed to call and expose my ignorance.  Since then I have re-read the Enron Gas Services case and have a pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial sides of the business.  The other theme that I have heard many Enron speakers use is the ""de-regulation"" of markets.  This certainly played a factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business. If you'll let me know when it's convenient to call next week I'll have some notes put together.  I'm teaching a class for a colleague on Monday so anytime after that is great. Thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip. John p.s.  I saw that the Univ of New Orleans has an Energy Finance endowed chair for a financial economist open.  If you ever decide to move back to the life of poverty of an academic I would love to recommend you for such a post. At 08:26 AM 9/27/00 -0500, you wrote: > >John, > >What about Thursday, 10:30 a.m.?

HI Iris: May 17th is fine.  He will probably need to come in the night before (the 16th) and he can make a hotel reservation at the Doubletree or the Hyatt and tell them he is a guest of Enron and he will get a corporate rate.  We will reimburse him for room expense only.  He will need to pick up any miscellaneous room charges.   We will also reimburse him for his flight expense and cab fare. The Doubletree Telephone # is:  713-759-0202 and the Hyatt Telephone is: 713-654-1234. He can either leave his receipts with me when he is here or mail them to me and I will have a check cut.  I will need his SS#. If you have any more questions, please let me know. Thanks! Shirley

Hello everyone: The next LNG ""Book"" meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday, September 6 at 2:00 pm in EB19C2. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw 3-5290 
Dr. Bill McMullen called you this morning and said that you had called the school last week asking for courses that they scheduled for quantitive analysis.

Hello Norma: In answer to your phone message I am sending you the following information. There is one thing you probably need to be aware of.  On the Research list, Elena Chilkina is shown as an Analyst P/T, however, in the records she is shown as an ""Adm Coord"".  This was done so that she could be considered non-exempt and receive overtime.  However, her actual job is an analyst. Also, Roman Zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months ago, but was never moved to the new group.  He is now up for rotation again and Vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation. If you have any questions, please call me.

Hello everyone. This memo only applies to the Research group on the 19th floor that use the colored printer ""Taj Mahal"". Vince has requested that I ask each of you to only use the colored printer ""Taj Mahal"" for presentations, newsletters, etc. that require at least 90% of color.  These cartridges are very expensive and several times we have picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it would be maybe 15-20 pages long.  This is not cost effective. If you have something that has color on the first page, but not on the rest of the presentation, then please just print the first page on the color printer and the rest on ""Bandit"" or ""Wagon"". Your help will be greatly appreciated! Thanks! 
Attached please find the completed form for Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research Group. He will be approving all purchases for cost center 107043.

Janice: Here is the memo I spoke to you about concerning the charges that need to be reversed. If you have any questions, please call me. Shirley 
Vince, Krishna and I met to discuss the Research and Development cross charges to GPG for January through June.  These charges are based upon a budgeted amount of allocating three resources to the GPG group (two resources for Revenue Management and one resource for GPG Marketing).  We have utilized the R&D group some during the first half of the year, but not to the full extent of three resources.  Vince and Krishna have agreed to reverse out some of the charges that were budgeted January through June.  We will revisit this issue again toward the end of the year to determine if any adjustments are necessary for July through December. The budgeted amount January through June has been distributed between the NNG and TW as follows: Research and Development BUDGET ($000)             NNG TW ET&S January   $46.7  $  46.7 February   $26.1 $20.4 $  46.5 March    $35.9 $10.2 $  46.1 April    $34.8 $10.2 $  45.0 May     $36.4      $  8.8 $  45.2 June     $36.4 $  8.8 $  45.2 $274.7 Out of the $274.7 budgeted for the first half of the year, $199.7 is to be reversed back to the Research and Development Department.  This reversal will occur in July.  Vince, Vera Apodaca (ext.  X35980) will be our contact to help facilitate the reversal of these charges. Elaine, the remaining $75.0 ($274.7-$199.7) is to be allocated with $50.0 going to the Revenue Management Work Order and  $25.0 remaining in O&M. If anyone has any questions or needs additional information, please don't hesitate to call me (X33098).  Thanks, Kim.

The budgeted amount January through June has been distributed between the NNG and TW as follows: Research and Development BUDGET ($000)             NNG TW ET&S January   $46.7  $  46.7 February   $26.1 $20.4 $  46.5 March    $35.9 $10.2 $  46.1 April    $34.8 $10.2 $  45.0 May     $36.4      $  8.8 $  45.2 June     $36.4 $  8.8 $  45.2 $274.7 Out of the $274.7 budgeted for the first half of the year, $199.7 is to be reversed back to the Research and Development Department.  This reversal will occur in July.  Vince, Vera Apodaca (ext.  X35980) will be our contact to help facilitate the reversal of these charges. Elaine, the remaining $75.0 ($274.7-$199.7) is to be allocated with $50.0 going to the Revenue Management Work Order and  $25.0 remaining in O&M. If anyone has any questions or needs additional information, please don't hesitate to call me (X33098).  Thanks, Kim. 
Hello everyone: A meeting has been scheduled between the addressees for Wednesday, August 16th at 4:00PM in EB1938. If you have any questions, please let me know. Regards, 
Hi Dawn: The Research Group has moved around so much that we do not know who to contact for accounting issues.  We need to reverse some money back to one of the groups we are supporting, but do not know who to contact. Do you have a clue? We are also still using an SAP Corp. Co# and RC# because we do not know where to go to get the new ENA #'s. If you could help in this we would really appreciate it. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw 
Vera: In studying the below information, if I am understanding it correctly, only $199.7 was to be reversed back to the Research Group and it should have occurred in July.  Do you not notice this entry either? Please let me know. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw 
Vera, We shall talk to the accounting group about the correction. Vince 08/09/2000 03:26 PM Vera Apodaca@ENRON Vera Apodaca@ENRON Vera Apodaca@ENRON 08/09/2000 03:26 PM 08/09/2000 03:26 PM 
Per mail dated June 15 from Kim Watson,  there was supposed to have occurred a true-up of $274.7 in July for the fist six months of 2000.  Reviewing July actuals,  I was not able to locate this entry.  Would you pls let me know whether this entry was made,  if not,  when do you intend to process it . thanks. 
Good morning Quentin: Vince Kaminski and the Research Group would like to conduct a telephone interview with you sometime next week.  Considering the time difference between Houston and Australia, it probably makes sense to try and schedule it very early in the morning your time, say 7:00 AM?  It would be 5:00 pm here in Houston. How does next Wednesday or Thursday, (8/16 or 8/17) at 7:00 AM your time sound? Also, please let me know if you want to be reached at home or work. Thanks Quentin and have a great day!

Hi, I wanted to inquire as to which day(s) might be convenient to meet with Vince and his colleagues. Many thanks David 
Vince: FYI 
We are records and information management consultants from Millican & Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we've taken to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each ENA department's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a vice president or director) within each group to first explain this project and seek permission to perform the inventory, and then to ask that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff. There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan project. Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic records--much of it has never been captured. Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be maintained. During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area(s) use. The inventory itself is non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you. Sara Bolken 
Hello everyone: Vince has asked me to send the following as a reminder: ****************************************************************************** **************** This is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group for cleaning the conference rooms after  meetings. For many  visitors to Enron a conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company. Last Thursday, some members of the group left, leaving behind their lunch boxes on the table.  Please, don't embarrass me by having to point out to you that your mothers don't work here. Vince 
Anita: I believe that Zimin was the one that asked me to bring him in.  Maybe you can check with him as to whether there is anyone else he wants you to include. Thanks! Anita DuPont@ENRON 07/31/2000 10:26 AM 
Vince: Shawn Grady from HR Staffing called me and asked me to schedule interviews with the people in Research.  He also mentioned that I should email you to find out if you want anyone from any other department to interview Rabi.  I am currently scheduling interviews with you, Krishna, Grant, Stinson, Zimin and Vasant.  Is their anyone else in Research that you want to interview him?  Please get back to me and I will set up the appts.  Thanks.  Anita 
Hello everyone! Not very many of you have filled out your timesheet in the excel spreadsheet If you cannot access the ""O"" drive. you will need to fill out one by hand until you can get access. Whichever way - I need them today!! Thanks!

Amy: Below are the individuals Vince wants to include in this meeting.  Do you want me to send the email out or is it better coming from you?  I have reserved EB19C1, however, since most of the guys are located on an upper floor we may want to see if we can get something up there. Let me know.

Hi Shirley, thanks for corresponding with Carol during my absence, and confirming our meeting with Vince Kaminski at 1:30 on May 4th.  I have a question about the logistics.  I believe Dr. Kaminski has received an invitation to an event in Houston: new Stanford president John Hennessy is visiting a number of cities on a ""welcome tour,"" and it just so happens he is hosting a luncheon in Houston on May 4th.  If Dr. Kaminski wants to attend the Hennessy Welcome Tour luncheon, Donna Lawrence and I could meet with him at 1:30 somewhere in the hotel.  If he's not attending the presidential event, please let me know where you are located, and we'll plan travel time accordingly. Regards, Susan Susan C. Hansen Director, Corporate Relations School of Engineering Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305-4027 (650) 725-4219 
Vince: Is it ok to send the following out to the interns? 
Hello everyone: Thanks to Krishna we have come up with a plan that I believe is going to save everyone some time.   We have created an Excel Spreadsheet, with the time sheet form, and there is a tab for each of you, in alphabetical order by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is saved in O:\Research\Common\SAP Timesheets\MMM-DD. (MMM = month and DD = 15th or end of the month time period - i.e., this time period is 7/16 - 7/31/00).  The regular 8 hour days have already been entered for each of you.  Therefore, if you have no exceptions you just need to type in your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked (Emp Sign), and save it. If you do have exception time, simply open that particular pay period and show the exception time (off-duty,vacation, overtime, sick time, jury time, family time, etc.) that you may have had during that pay period.  Some of the codes have already been entered for you, the rest are listed at the bottom of the spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever applies. If you are an exempt employee you need only show your off-duty time or exception time.  If you are non-exempt you must show all hours worked and if you have overtime, you must add that to the 8 hours regular time. There is no code for non-exempt overtime. This should make it much easier for everyone.  However, I will need you to fill out this timesheet form by the 13th and 29th of each month.  I will try and remind you by email the day before. I would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation, HOD day, or any other off-duty that you know about before hand, that way if you are out of pocket for any reason and cannot fill in one of the forms,  I will be able to fill in your timesheet for you. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know. Thanks! 
Good morning Mr. Bandini: I am Dr. Kaminski's assistant and he has asked me to forward a copy of his ""bio"" and the following information to you. Dr. Kaminski's Email Address: vkamins@enron.com Telephone Number:  713/853-3848 Thank you for your interest. Sincerely, Shirley Crenshaw Administrative Coordinator Enron Corp.

Oops!  Forgot to attach! 
Attached is the off duty and overtime that was reported to me for the above pay period.  You are the only ones in our group that had these reported. Please review and if there is an error, please let me know by next Monday the 17th and I can correct it.  Otherwise, we cannot correct it until the next pay period. Thanks! Shirley 
Hello All: I am afraid I did not allow enough time to do the time sheets by asking for them by the 15th and 31st.  I really need these sheets by the 13th and 28th of each month as it takes a good half day to enter all the new times in the time sheets. I am resending this, because as of now I have received very few timesheets and I really need to start imputting the time. Thanks! Shirley 
Hello everyone: Well it is almost that time again!  I am going to try something different.  I am forwarding you the time sheet by email.  Save the document to whatever drive you want to and then fill out any off duty time or overtime that you had and return to me by email.   I will need this by the 15 and 30 (or 31st) of each month. This may work better than hand delivering. Let me know what you think.

Dear Ms. Crenshaw: I recently accepted a quant position with Texaco in Houston.  Lara Berry from Enron contacted me just after that, and I told her of the situation. I agreed to send her my resume (which I did) and keep in touch. Enron is a fabulous corporation with exciting opportunities.  Mr. Kaminski is very well known in the energy field, and I have read some of his material.  I am extremely pleased that you all would be interested in me; however, I have given my word to Texaco. The Texaco position offers a lot of opportunity and risk.  This is the kind of challenge for which I am looking.  If things do not work out, however, I would definitely contact Enron again and cherish any opportunity for an interview. Thank you very much, Cliff Parsons --On Monday, June 26, 2000, 11:27 AM -0500 Shirley Crenshaw <Shirley.Crenshaw@enron.com> wrote: > > > Good morning Mr. Parsons: > > The Enron Corp.

Hello all: According to the email below, we are going to have to bill your cell phone= =20 invoices to your credit cards and receive reimbursement on an expense=20 report.

Thanks Susan: However, Vince has not received his Financial Times at all this week.  I have called everyday and they tell me they will send a recovery copy, but so far we have not received one.  Is there anyway we could get a copy for him today? Your help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Enron North America Corp. 
Hello Toni: The Research Group would like to bring Bruce R. James in for an exploratory interview sometime next week (June 26 - 30).

Krishnarao   Director Zimin Lu   Director Tanya Tamarchenko  Manager Please ask Bruce to give you several dates within next week that would accommodate him and we can coordinate his dates with Vince's schedule and the schedules of the rest of the group.   Just call me when you have some dates and times. His resume is attached. 
Hi Professor Ronn: I have ordered a flip chart and markers and an overhead projector. There were 11 pages in your presentation and they look fine.  We have already made the copies. I believe everything is set - if you think of anything else, please let me know. Enjoy your dinner tonight and we will see you tomorrow. Regards, Shirley Crenshaw ""Ehud I. Ronn"" <eronn@mail.utexas.edu> on 06/21/2000 02:03:03 PM 
Shirley: >Please let me know if you need >anything else. There is one additional item I would request:  If the room does not contain a blackboard or whiteboard, I would appreciate a flip chart and markers. I am faxing you my Presentation Handout for tomorrow.  I would be grateful if your produced copies in sufficient number for tomorrow's 11:30 a.m. meeting; Vince advises me the number of attendees will be in the 25 - 30 range.  I will also bring along a ""master copy"" in case the trasmission unduly mangles the fax. Thanks, Ehud ============================================== Ehud I.

Professor Ronn: Thank you for your email and I wish to respond as follows: I have left a message with our travel agency asking if they can get you a hotel reservation closer into town.  I will let you know. I have ordered an overhead projector and the room already has a screen installed.  However, there is really not room for a lectern.  The overhead will sit on the end of the large conference table and most have room to use part of the table for their presentation copies. I will be glad to make copies for you, however, it would be a big help if you could email me a copy of your presentation on Wednesday.  Thursday mornings around here get pretty hectic sometimes and we may not have time to make the copies. I hope this meets with your approval.  Please let me know if you need anything else. We look forward to your visit. Regards, Shirley Crenshaw 713/853-5290 
Martin: Vince and Lance want you to attend this presentation if possible.  Please let me know if you will be going to lunch also. Thanks! Shirley 
Would you like to attend the presentation and join me for lunch with WEFA. Any other suggestions re attendance. Please, let Shirley know. Vince 
Dear Vince Thanks for your voicemail and delighted to have you confirm lunch on May 1. Kemm Farney the head of WEFA's Electric Power services will be travelling with me this time. I expect there may be other ENRON colleagues that may care to join us for lunch so don't hesitate to invite as you see fit. For reservations purposes, perhaps you arrange to let me know numbers. Kemm would also be prepared to informally present our current power outlook to a larger group at 11:00, if this would be of interest. As you know, these types of presentations are part of all your WEFA Energy Retainer Package. I will also plan to update you with respect to our current multi client study schedule for the remainder of the year. Regards, Peter Peter A.

Hello Celeste: Plans are in the works to rotate Roy Ibasco from the Research Group into Henry Arora's group.  Vanessa Carranza is handling the churn request.  I am not sure of the rotation date, but we need his desk by the 15th for Gwyn Koepke. You probably already know all of this, but just in case. Shirley 
Hi Vanessa: 
Shirley- I need to have Roy Ibasco's things moved to EB2930C from EB1948 and have it charged to Co/RC 413-1708.  Please give me a call if you have any questions! Thanks- Vanessa C 3-5030 
Good morning everyone: Several of us were talking and in order to help us get into the ""Holiday Spirit"" we thought it would be nice if each of us brought an appetizer, dessert, chips, popcorn, etc. or anything you desire, next Monday, the 18th.  We will put everything out in one of the conference rooms and celebrate ALL DAY!  Never mind about the calories - this is a once-a-year thing! This is not mandatory - just if you want to and if you remember! Also, don't forget the ""Holiday Party"" at Damians on Tuesday night 5:30 - 7:30 PM. Have a great day! Shirley

FYI Vince 
Dear Dr. Kaminski here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow Dr. V. Kaminski Enron P.O. Box 1188 Houston, Texas 77251-1188 Dear Dr. Kaminski March 12, 2001 I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories. The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April 27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel arrangements on this end if so desired. We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary equipment for your presentation. We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston. Sincerely W. Fitzgibbon

Vince: I am not sure I know what Becky is talking about.  Can you let me know where you want the 1.2% allocation to go? Thanks! 
Research is currently billing and are going to bill CALME region in 2001, will you check with Vince and see where I should move the 1.2% allocating to them this year as well as next year?  If you have any questions, call me. Thanx. 
We will not send out the invoices to other BUs until further notice, because the support departments were told to decrease their budgets.  Also, for those who are going to bill EI, we need to go back to the support department and ask for a new allocation. Enron Global Assets: made up of the commercial groups of India, South America, Central America and Asia EGM:  LNG, Middle East and Puerto Rico support and commercial teams joined EGM EES:  Asset Operations group went to EES Corp:  all back office support groups (Accounting, Tax and Finance) Effective October of this year, the above split was done.  Don't forget to ask for new allocation percentage from your support group(s) for CALME region.  If you have any questions, call me. 
Tom: I do not think Vince has any plans to go to UT the rest of this year.  Would Professor Lasdon be interested in coming to Houston?   They sometimes do that if they have something they really want to discuss with him. If not,  I will forward this to Vince and keep him in mind for the next trip. Thanks! Shirley Tom Halliburton@ENRON 11/13/2000 01:38 PM 
Shirley, Leon Lasdon would like to meet Vince sometime when Vince is at UT Austin. He'd like to find out more about what we do, and of course is looking for opportunities for research projects and summer interns.  I am planning to visit him sometime soon as he has an interesting hydro modelling project. Leon is a well known person in the optimization world - his nonlinear solver is used in Excel, he's written text books (I used it lots during my thesis work), and he is a Professor in the Department of Management Science and Information Systems at Austin.  tel 512 471 9433, email lasdon@mail.utexas.edu.

Vince: The IT Migration team called and said that they need an email from you stating that you do not want your lap top ""Ghost upped""? (Not sure if this is the correct term).   They said they were supposed to do this to all computers during the migration process, but since you requested that they not do this, then they need an email from you with this request. You need to send the email to:     Kacee Downey/Enron@EnronXGate Thanks! 
This will be in EB49C1

Julie: I talked to both Maureen and Tanya and neither one want this service and have not been using it. Maureen told me that she told you a year ago that she did not want Telerate (when she was supporting Gary Hickerson's group on 30).  If that is the case, we probably need a refund. Let me know if there is anything that can be done about this. The only person in our group that wants Telerate is Jason Sokolov and I put in a request for that yesterday.  Please cancel everything else. Thanks! Shirley 
Carol: For your information and Susan's, Christie Patrick will not be available on the 4th of May.  She will be out of the city.  Maybe Susan can contact her directly at another time. I still have 1:30 as the time for Vince and Susan to meet. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw 
Good morning Susan: Vince forwarded the below message to me and after looking over his calendar, he appears to be free most of the afternoon on the 4th of May. Please let me know what would be a good time for you and I will block it out before someone else gets it. Thanks!

Susan, Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to meet with you on May the 4th. I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (713) 853 5290, to call you to set up the meeting. Also, for your information, we have recently set up a special unit to coordinate Enron's relationships with the universities. The person running this unit is Christie Patrick.

Dear Dr. Kaminski, Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions. I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday, May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip planning. The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best points of contact. I look forward to hearing from you about your availability, Sincerely, Susan Hansen Susan C. Hansen Director, Corporate Relations School of Engineering Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305-4027 (650) 725-4219 
Hi Liz: Vince has two expense reports pending for approval from Greg Whalley. They are:  London Trip - 8,051.59 Philadelphia (Wharton Business School) - 2,067.47 Please have Greg approve these as soon as possible. The Wharton School will be cross-charged to Christie Patrick's cost center. but for expediency in getting this paid it was submitted on our cost center. Thanks! 
Clifford: In reviewing our February EIS Billing Summary for Co#0413, CC#107043, I have several questions. Telerate: (February charges: $3,032,35) I polled the group and only one person has asked for Telerate and he is not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him. The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason Sokolov, unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate. Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is for Jason Sokolov. Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96) No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for Hector Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for it.  Please remove from the Research Cost Center. The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center. Clayton Vernon  No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center Brad Amoine  No longer with Enron   Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center Shalesh Ganjoo No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center I hope this is not too confusing! Please advise. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw 
Kevin/Karin: My understanding from Vince is that London is reponsible for the expenses incurred while their people are here for training, as well as for any of our people that go to London at their request. It should be easy for them to expense this airfare for Steve from their office and charge it to whatever cost center Tony is going to be under in London. Shirley Kevin G Moore 04/03/2001 06:24 AM 
Please take a look at this e-mail ....... I AM ALSO IN NEED OF INSTRUCTION.... Thanks Kevin Moore 
Good morning: The Research Group will have 5 Rice students, who are working on an Enron project for their Doctorate, coming to Enron for approximately 1 week.  They will be sitting in a conference room located on the 19th floor Research area. We need to get them internet access (to be applied to one computer), with one logon id and password. Will you please let me know what I need to do to get this accomplished? They will be coming this Thursday, April 5th. Thanks!

I am a Ph.D. physicist and have worked for the last five years in post-doctoral researcher positions in astrophysics.  A few months ago, I realized that I had reached the limit of my academic career options, at least for the near future.  After reading about careers in the private sector and discussing possibilities with some family members and friends, it became apparent that my technical and mathematical skills could be transferred to the private sector, with better long-term career options and a more dynamic workplace environment than in academic research.  The energy industry is particularly attractive as it begins to deregulate.  I have been directed to Enron by several different people as a very forward-thinking and growing company and one which values its employees. Because of my statistical and mathematical skills, I am interested in a position as a quantitative analyst.  However, if there are other areas where the people at Enron think I could contribute, I am open to other options.  My other experience, such as project management, is outlined in my resume.  I have worked in a collaboration of 30 astrophysicists from the US, Ireland, and England and I am a capable independent worker as well.  I have excellent written and oral communication skills and have made presentations to audiences ranging from technical experts to school-aged children. Thank you again for your time and effort in passing this resume on.  I look forward to talking with you. Sincerely, Mike Catanese - Mike's Short Resume.doc

Hello all: I have some ""good"" news and I have some ""bad"" news.  The ""good"" news is that we are growing!  The ""bad"" news is that we are running out of space. Therefore,  just for the summer we need to use Jose's and Joe's offices on the 19th floor for ""summer"" interns. I will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won't be ringing all the time.  However, we can put them back after the summer is over. I hope this is not too inconvenient for you, but with Roman and Jason needing spaces on the 19th floor, and another new hire coming on board, we are left without any extra spaces. Thanks! Shirley

Ms. Crenshaw, Thank you for sending the bio so quickly.  It's exactly what I was looking for. We are planning to compile the conference speakers' papers for distribution to the participants.  While I will not need Dr. Kaminski's contribution for several weeks, an abstract of his presentation as soon as possible would be very useful to the conference organizers. I will also need the following information: - Dr. Kaminski's audio/video equipment requirements for his presentation - will he be joining the conference organizers and speakers for dinner on May 29? - which nights will he be staying in Toronto?  I will reserve a room at the conference hotel - any dietary restrictions or special requests Your help is much appreciated.

Hello all: Bad news!  Most of the really nice restaurants in Breckenridge close on the 22nd of April.  We may have to have all the dinners at the hotel.  Do you have any other suggestions? I will check with Scott Yeager's wife again today to see if she perhaps knows of another good restaurant that may be open, but the owner of Pierre's told me most of them close and open again for the summer season in  May. Thanks! Shirley Sheryl Lara@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 03/28/2000 06:29 PM 
Ravi: Can you answer Shirley's question.  Are you planning to have the entire group go to dinner, or just senior management?  Please let us know your plan. Sheryl 
Sheryl: I am going to call Pierre's Restaurant and make reservations for Thursday night - will everyone on the list be attending or just part? Thanks! Sheryl Lara@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 03/28/2000 03:09 PM

We also find= =20 out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,= =20 it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep= =20 abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, le= t=20 alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a=20 project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of= =20 this group.=20 As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag= =20 lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes. = =20 It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new=20 technology and development, as well as with each other=01,s work, so that w= e do=20 not have to reinvent the wheels. =20 We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us wil= l=20 take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from= =20 theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing= ,=20 process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything= =20 one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have= =20 been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that=20 bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own=20 presentation style.  It could be =20 everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving=20 style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style= =20 that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your=20 presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon th= e=20 responsibility of organizing the seminar.=20 We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that=20 purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin o= r=20 Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and= =20 provide a tentative schedule.

Vince, Grant,, Amitava,  Kevin, Clayton and Chonawee have promised to give presentations to us.

Hi Julie: The March Invoice #000166 was sent to our accounting department for payment on March 28th.  I have a call into them to see what happened to it.  I will let you know. The AUD 5000 invoice was sent to the accounting department but they sent it back saying they cannot pay invoices in foreign currency.  So I then had to send it to the Treasury Dept.  I will check on it today also. As far as the other invoice.   It should be sent to our Australia office to the attention of Paul Quilkey.  We had agreed to split this with them.  Their address is: Paul Quilkey Enron Australia PTY.LTD. Level 21 9 Castlereagh Street Sydney, NSW 200000, Australia If you need anything else, please let me know. Shirley .

Hello everyone. This memo only applies to the Research group on the 19th floor that use the colored printer ""Taj Mahal"". Vince has requested that I ask each of you to only use the colored printer ""Taj Mahal"" for presentations, newsletters, etc. that require at least 90% of color.  These cartridges are very expensive and several times we have picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it would be maybe 15-20 pages long.  This is not cost effective. If you have something that has color on the first page, but not on the rest of the presentation, then please just print the first page on the color printer and the rest on ""Bandit"" or ""Wagon"". Your help will be greatly appreciated! Thanks! 
Vince: FYI 
We are records and information management consultants from Millican & Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we've taken to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each ENA department's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a vice president or director) within each group to first explain this project and seek permission to perform the inventory, and then to ask that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff. There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan project. Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic records--much of it has never been captured. Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be maintained. During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area(s) use. The inventory itself is non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you. Sara Bolken

I have recently come on board as Treasurer ,Enron India . Prior to joining , I was with Reliance Industries , a petrochemical conglomerate in India. The  Central banking authorities are now thinking of permitting corporates  to hedge their oil and other related risks. I believe the literature published by Risk in collaboration with Enron has come to be considered as an industry standard. Would it be possible to arrange for two copies to be sent across to us . Thanx N Regards G.Subramaniam Treasurer, Enron India Pvt. Ltd. 36 ,Maker Chambers VI, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021

Hi Liz: Vince has two expense reports pending for approval from Greg Whalley. They are:  London Trip - 8,051.59 Philadelphia (Wharton Business School) - 2,067.47 Please have Greg approve these as soon as possible. The Wharton School will be cross-charged to Christie Patrick's cost center. but for expediency in getting this paid it was submitted on our cost center. Thanks! 
Frank: I discussed this with Vince Kaminski and he said that, while we would be glad to assist you, the time involved in ordering and collecting the money (they are pretty expensive), distributing the books, etc. would be too time consuming for us at this time. You can go to www.lacimagroup.com and order the books directly.  Tell them you are ordering the books for use at Enron and they should give you a 15% discount. I am sorry that we cannot do this at this time.

As we had discussed in our phone conversation Friday, I would ask you to order six copies of the newly Enron-published ""Energy Derivatives"" for Paradigm Strategy Group.  We do the various derivatives training courses for Enron, and this book will be required reading for all our instructors. Please advise as to the total cost of the books.  If payment by check is OK, please let me know to whom the check should be made payable. You can reach me by e-mail, or phone at 281-360-7822. Thanks for your help. Frank Ribeiro Paradigm 
Hi Kevin: I was out of the office on Thursday and Friday.   I have discussed this with Vince Kaminski and he says the charges are correct.  Jason Sokolov reports to Tanya Tamarchenko in the Research group and all of their costs are charged to RAC. If you need further verification, please contact Vince Kaminski at 3-3848. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw Administrative Coordinator Enron Research Group 3-5290 
Iris: I forwarded the information to Donna Lowry in our Compliance Dept.  However, I am afraid she had bad news. Enron would sponsor the renewals, but the US Securities group does not recognize UK Securities exams without further testing here in the US. She said she would get back with you and explain it in greater detail.  But, from what I understand, you will need to take some exam here before renewing. When you hear from her let me know.

Kim: The interviews conducted on February 2 are just exploratory interviews to see where Punit might fit within Enron.  Vince thought he might fit in John's group. The title and $$ amount will not be determined until it is decided where he should be (if at all).  If John is interested after the interview, then he and Vince can get together to discuss $$ and title. If you or John have any other questions, please let me know. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 
Shirley, It is to my understand that Vince is bringing in Punit for a day of interviews.  John has agreed to meet with him on February 2.

Kim: Punit is a Carnegie Mellon student that will be graduating with an MS in Computational Finance in May 2001.  Several of our guys interviewed him at Carnegie Mellon recently and were very impressed.  Vince says that he is definately a trading candidate. Would John be interested in interviewing him?  I am attaching his resume for you to look over and then let me know if John would be interested. Thanks! Have a Merry Christmas! Shirley - Punit+Rawal+newresume.doc

Vince has asked that I forward the following: ************************************************************************ We will begin a seminar devoted to the book on ""Energy Derivatives"", written by Clewlow and Strickland, every first and third Friday of each month, beginning  January 19th.  Stinson Gibner has volunteered to act as the seminar coordinator. On January 19th only, the seminar will be held in EB30C1. Every session thereafter will be in EB49C1.  The seminar will be conducted like a ""brown bag""  (everyone bring their own lunch). The seminar is mandatory for every member of the group who started after January 1, 2000.   However, all other members of the group are invited to participate. The books have been ordered and hopefully will arrive by the day of the first meeting. Vince Kaminski 
Hi Vince: Lance's telephone # is:  (512) 280-5052. 
Vera: Vince wants to talk to Becky Pham before we do this - I have a call in to her for a short meeting.  I will let you know as soon as possible. Thanks! Shirley 12/07/2000 11:21 AM Vera Apodaca@ENRON Vera Apodaca@ENRON Vera Apodaca@ENRON 12/07/2000 11:21 AM 12/07/2000 11:21 AM 
Shirley,  I just talked to you over the phone and here is the information: The adjustment total is $135.6. NNG receives a credit of $109 and TW $(26.6).  Pls make sure it gets into the December business.  Thanks. 
Krishna, Attached is a spreadsheet with the figures we discussed earlier.  For July-Dec, ETS will keep half of the amount allocated (equivalent to 1.5 employees, $135.6) from the corporate allocations to ETS.  If this looks OK to you, I would like to have Vera work with Shirley to handle the accounting adjustment similar to mid year.  Many thanks, Kim. Vera, Here is the Year 2000 spreadsheet.  As you will see, we will need to work with Shirley Crenshaw (X35290) with Enron Research Group to coordinate a similar accounting adjustment to the one we made mid year.  I will send the Year 2001 Budgeted spreadsheet to you in the next few days (just in case it changes with the approval of the science workorder).  Please call me if you have any questions about this spreadsheet.  Thanks, Kim. 
Norma: Ted Murphy would like to have Jason removed from his cost center effective  December 16th.  Vince said that it would be ok to have him added to our cost center, effective that date.  He is not supposed to start with the Research Group until the 28th, but needs a home from the 16th to the 28th, so we will pick him up. Can you take care of this? Thanks! Shirley

Hi Samer! Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving! I found out the ""scoop"" on the ticket.  It was non-refundable and non- refundable tickets cannot be transferred.  It was just your seat that Maureen's husband used. I will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $330.50. The best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for the check from us. Sorry for the confusion! Cheers! Shirley ""Samer Takriti"" <takriti@us.ibm.com> on 11/20/2000 01:41:23 PM 
Shirley, How are you? Things are fine over here. We are still trying to settle in; this process seems to be taking forever. I would like to ask for your help. I have received a statement from American Express related to my Enron account. The charge amount is $330.50, which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket. After calling the Travel Agency in the Park, I found out that this was the ticket that I was supposed to have used to fly to Colorado. However, the ticket was used by Maurine's husband and Maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket. Also, I remember calling the TAP and cancelling prior to the travel date. Can you help me figure out what is going on here? I am not sure who is supposed to pay for this. I disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected. I appreciate your help. Thanks. -Samer

Vince probably has more, I will let you know. Thanks! Shirley Kevin G Moore 11/03/2000 12:00 PM 
Goodmorning everyone , Last year we did quite a bit of Christmas baskets, during the time we were in the process of another major move.

Thanks Kevin Moore Please any comments , question , answers  - feel free to call  x34710 
Vince/Vasant: Do you know who Todd Kimberlain is?  Is he supposed to be in the Research Group and charged to our cost center?  He is. I have never heard of him, but when you pull his name up, it shows that he is reporting to Mark Tawny, but is in the Research Group and being charged to our cost center. He is also on our time site, but I have not been doing his time.  I hope somebody has! Let me know, Thanks! Shirley

Becky: Attached is the October ""revised"" Research Group Headcount: 
Please verify the attached file for accuracy, complete the blank columns and add any new employees.  If you have any questions, call me.  Thanx. 
Gwyn: Just because the A/A program does not have a contract does not mean that Enron does not.  Do you have a telephone number for Melly's and I will call them directly and ask her if she has a contract. Thanks! Shirley Gwyn Koepke@ENRON 10/23/2000 04:22 PM 
Vince, The A/A program does not have a contract in place with Melly Language Services.  It appears that by the note below from my contact in the A/A-HR department, the reimbursement policy appears to be driven by department, not Enron at large. As I mentioned earlier, if I continue with my current tutor, but outside of the Melly Language Services, the cost to the department will decrease for me to take French classes. Pls advise if Research will be able to continue to fund my lessons. Many thanks, Gwyn Koepke 
Vince: Do you want to renew the below listed subscriptions? Please let me know. Thanks Shirley Shirley, I hope you had a good weekend.  The following subscriptions for Vince are up for renewal.

Vince: When do you want to try and have Grant's party? Below is a list of people that he would like to invite. Shirley 
Shirley: Vince suggested I send you a list of non-research folks whom I would like to invite to the going away party. Ted Murphy George Hopley Bernie Aucoin Edith Cross Vlady Gorny Naveen Andrews Debbie Brackett. The above are the essentials.  I also like to invite the following, but I recognize that Vince may want to control costs, so I will leave it up to you and him to invite or not. Bill Bradford Jim Simpson (structuring, works for Bernie) Rudi Zipter Greg Woulfe (EBS trader, not a Portland marketer!) Scott Tholan Kevin Golden Rebecca ???  (works with Vlady). I will also try to invite Terry Lohrenz unless instructed not to. Give me a call at home if you have questions.

The Research Group: It is with a deep sense of regret that I announce that Grant Masson will be leaving the Research Group and Enron, effective today. Grant has been a very important part of the Research Group's growth and stability within Enron and he will be deeply missed. We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with all the ""good"" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the ""Good Luck and Best Wishes"" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An announcement will be forthcoming at a later date. Please take a minute to wish Grant the ""Best"". Sincerely, Vince

Grant has been a very important part of the Research Group's growth and stability within Enron and he will be deeply missed. We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with all the ""good"" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the ""Good Luck and Best Wishes"" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An announcement will be forthcoming at a later date. Please take a minute to wish Grant the ""Best"". Sincerely, 
Vince: Karen Marshall from Community Relations called and said that you are the one that needs to call the NSF and register yourself and Enron with the Foundation.  They will give you a password and you can pass it on to Youyi. The number below is the one that you call. Thanks! Shirley 
Dear Shirley, I appreciate you for forwarding this info further. Best regards, Youyi 
Dear Youyi: The person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration. FastLane User Support: 1-800-673-6188. FastLane Availability (Recording): 1-800-437-7408. After enron is registered (I think it's a free registration), you provide the following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to nsf. NSF will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission (called fastlane). Since all proposals have to be submitted through fastlane after Oct. 1, 2000, this is the must.

Vince, Anita and Kevin: I went to the dentist yesterday afternoon, and unfortunately, I am going to have to have some oral surgery. It is scheduled for 9:30 AM on Thursday the 21st of September, so I will probably be out the rest of the day.  Hopefully, I will return on Friday, the 22nd if all goes well. Just wanted to let you know. Thanks! Shirley ****************************************************************************** ****** Anita and Kevin: I will also be on vacation next Wednesday, the 13th for one day. Thanks! Shirley 
Hello Norma: In answer to your phone message I am sending you the following information. There is one thing you probably need to be aware of.  On the Research list, Elena Chilkina is shown as an Analyst P/T, however, in the records she is shown as an ""Adm Coord"".  This was done so that she could be considered non-exempt and receive overtime.  However, her actual job is an analyst. Also, Roman Zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months ago, but was never moved to the new group.  He is now up for rotation again and Vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation. If you have any questions, please call me. 
Hello everyone: In doing the SAP timesheets this time I have discovered there are several people listed in the 105896 Cost Center - ORG.

Farouk Lalji  501609  Analyst rotated out Ainsley Gaddis  400250  Summer Intern returned to School (last day the 11th) Mandeep Chahal 502876  Now with the new Power Co.

Hi Dawn: The Research Group has moved around so much that we do not know who to contact for accounting issues.  We need to reverse some money back to one of the groups we are supporting, but do not know who to contact. Do you have a clue? We are also still using an SAP Corp. Co# and RC# because we do not know where to go to get the new ENA #'s. If you could help in this we would really appreciate it. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw 
Hello everyone: Attached is the churn relocation request for some office exchanges within the Research group on the 19th Floor.  I have grouped them in sets of two which are the exchanges. This is a very RUSH order.  We would appreciate your getting to this as soon as possible - the 15th of August would be great, if possible. Let me know if there is something that you do not understand.  Thanks! Shirley 
Vince: If it is all right I would like to take a couple hours vacation in the morning.  My grandson starts ""middle school"" (6th grade) and he wants me to take him. I should be in by 10:00 am. Thanks! Shirley 
Norma: Here is the ""job description"" that Vince asked me to provide. Let me know if you need anything else. Shirley 
Sheila, No, we have to go through the posting phase first. I shall ask Shirley to provide the job description. Vince 
Hello everyone: If you were not able to access the spreadsheet we created for your time, on the O:\Research\Common\SAP Timesheets site, please let me know. If a box came up with ""read only"" on it, you may not have access to the O:\ drive.  Let me know and I will issue an SRRS request for access. Thanks. Shirley 
Hello everyone: Vince has asked me to send the following as a reminder: ****************************************************************************** **************** This is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group for cleaning the conference rooms after  meetings. For many  visitors to Enron a conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company. Last Thursday, some members of the group left, leaving behind their lunch boxes on the table.  Please, don't embarrass me by having to point out to you that your mothers don't work here. Vince 
Hello everyone! Not very many of you have filled out your timesheet in the excel spreadsheet If you cannot access the ""O"" drive. you will need to fill out one by hand until you can get access. Whichever way - I need them today!! Thanks! 
Candice: Listed below are the individuals that will be attending the offsite, August 18 - 20, 2000. Vince Kaminski Stinson Gibner P. V. Krishnarao Grant Masson Zimin Lu Vasant Shanbhogue Mike Roberts Maureen Raymond Castaneda Tanya Tamarchenko Osman Sezgen Samer Takriti Shirley Crenshaw Regards, 
Good afternoon Mr. Xu Your resume has been forwarded to the Research Group with Enron Corp. They would like to conduct a telephone interview with you at your convenience. Please let me know your available dates and times along with the telephone number you may be reached at and they will call you. The interviewers would be: Vince Kaminski  Managing Director Stinson Gibner  Vice President Zimin Lu  Director Look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Shirley Crenshaw Administrative Coordinator Enron Corp. Research 713/853-5290 
Vince: They are already asking for evaluations on the following individuals most of whom were just interviewed yesterday!  However, I do not know who Bruce Kamich is - I don't remember his interview at all. Can you give me something to tell Toni. Thanks! 
Vince: Is it ok to send the following out to the interns? 
Hello everyone: Thanks to Krishna we have come up with a plan that I believe is going to save everyone some time.   We have created an Excel Spreadsheet, with the time sheet form, and there is a tab for each of you, in alphabetical order by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is saved in O:\Research\Common\SAP Timesheets\MMM-DD. (MMM = month and DD = 15th or end of the month time period - i.e., this time period is 7/16 - 7/31/00).  The regular 8 hour days have already been entered for each of you.  Therefore, if you have no exceptions you just need to type in your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked (Emp Sign), and save it. If you do have exception time, simply open that particular pay period and show the exception time (off-duty,vacation, overtime, sick time, jury time, family time, etc.) that you may have had during that pay period.  Some of the codes have already been entered for you, the rest are listed at the bottom of the spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever applies. If you are an exempt employee you need only show your off-duty time or exception time.  If you are non-exempt you must show all hours worked and if you have overtime, you must add that to the 8 hours regular time. There is no code for non-exempt overtime. This should make it much easier for everyone.  However, I will need you to fill out this timesheet form by the 13th and 29th of each month.  I will try and remind you by email the day before. I would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation, HOD day, or any other off-duty that you know about before hand, that way if you are out of pocket for any reason and cannot fill in one of the forms,  I will be able to fill in your timesheet for you. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know. Thanks! 
Oops!  Forgot to attach! 
Attached is the off duty and overtime that was reported to me for the above pay period.  You are the only ones in our group that had these reported. Please review and if there is an error, please let me know by next Monday the 17th and I can correct it.  Otherwise, we cannot correct it until the next pay period. Thanks! Shirley 
Hello All: I am afraid I did not allow enough time to do the time sheets by asking for them by the 15th and 31st.  I really need these sheets by the 13th and 28th of each month as it takes a good half day to enter all the new times in the time sheets. I am resending this, because as of now I have received very few timesheets and I really need to start imputting the time. Thanks! Shirley 
Hello everyone: Well it is almost that time again!  I am going to try something different.  I am forwarding you the time sheet by email.  Save the document to whatever drive you want to and then fill out any off duty time or overtime that you had and return to me by email.   I will need this by the 15 and 30 (or 31st) of each month. This may work better than hand delivering. Let me know what you think.

Hello all: Along with the inception of the New SAP time keeping, we also have new expense account forms. They will no longer use your social security number as the id on your expense accounts,  they want you to use your new employee # that was sent to you by email to access HRonline. In order for Anita and myself to continue to do your expense reports, we will need your new employee #. Please send this number to me as soon as possible. Thanks! 
Shijie: I spoke with Vince and he said Friday the 28th of July would be fine for your visit to Enron. Please let me know your itinerary when you have it confirmed.  There are two hotels downtown Houston, The Doubletree and the Hyatt Regency that are very close to the Enron Bldg. If you need help with anything, please let me know. Look forward to having you at Enron. Regards, Shirley Crenshaw Shijie Deng <deng@isye.gatech.edu> on 06/30/2000 10:15:43 AM

Hello Celeste: Plans are in the works to rotate Roy Ibasco from the Research Group into Henry Arora's group.  Vanessa Carranza is handling the churn request.

Hi Shirley, I have one(1) space available at  777 Clay garage. Please let me know who the summer intern is thats needing a space. Please advise asap. thanks,Louis Shirley Crenshaw@ECT 05/15/2000 11:36 AM 
Good morning Louis: We would like to requst a parking spot at 777 Clay Street for the months of June, July, August and September. We will have 3 employees from the London office that will be rotating on special assignment to our group. Is there a way that we can go ahead and reserve the spot and I will let you know the car information and driver information as they come? Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is 100038. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 
Teresa: Please change Elena Chilkina's payroll record to reflect non-exempt instead of exempt in order for her to be paid overtime.  Vince Kaminski has approved this action. Her time site is:  0428 If you need anything else, please let me know. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 
Vince: Here are several items that you need to know about. 1.  Paul Johnson said that Monday night would be fine for the dinner with Spyros. 2.  Lucy Deathridge from Risk called and needed your presentation for the Boston conference by this evening in order to have copies made.  I told her you were in meetings and had been very busy, I did not know whether your presentation was ready or not.  We can have 500 copies made from the copy center and overnight them to her next week, but you won't be here on the 9th to do this.  Do you have any suggestions? 3.  I have been trying to schedule a meeting that Mike Roberts called about regarding e-online.  He said to schedule it for Friday at 11:30 am.  I called Mark Palmer and he knew nothing about the meeting, but said he would be here at 11:30 am.  However, I have been unable to reach Dan Diamond. Mike said that you might have his cell phone? Thanks! Shirley 
Elizabeth, Can you please direct me to someone to assist us in making an offer to a young lady we just interviewed?  We would like to bring her in as a summer intern the same way that we brought in James Bradley Aimone. She will be reporting to Stinson Gibner and I believe she is available right away. I am attaching her resume. Thanks for your help. 
Hi Louis: We will have several employees from the London office coming to Houston this summer (they will be rotating) beginning 7/31/00.  Can we get a parking space at 777 Clay for them?  We only need one for 7/31/00 - 11/30/00 (4 months). The other alternative would be the stickers for Allen Center.  Do you still have them? Please let me know. Thanks! 
Hello all: I have some ""good"" news and I have some ""bad"" news.  The ""good"" news is that we are growing!  The ""bad"" news is that we are running out of space. Therefore,  just for the summer we need to use Jose's and Joe's offices on the 19th floor for ""summer"" interns. I will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won't be ringing all the time.  However, we can put them back after the summer is over. I hope this is not too inconvenient for you, but with Roman and Jason needing spaces on the 19th floor, and another new hire coming on board, we are left without any extra spaces. Thanks! Shirley 
Hello all: 
Good morning: Vince's direct reports will give a presentation to Dave Delainey, Monday, April 24th at 3:00 PM in conference room EB3321. This presentation will be an update of the one that was given to Greg Whalley. If you have any questions, please call me. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290

Good morning all: Maureen Raymond Castaneda is officed in EB1939.  She has terrible migraine headaches which are made worse by light.  We would like to get a price on having an on/off switch installed in her room.  As of now, they have removed the light bulbs, but said that may not completely answer the problem as some one may see that they are out and request they be replaced. I think the answer (if it is not too expensive) would be to have a switch installed. Please let me know. Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is 100038. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290

Hi Shalesh: The move team has informed me that they will not be able to move your telephone until Wednesday, the 23rd.    I have asked them to bring you boxes by Friday, but I have not heard back from them.  Your computer is here, but without a telehone, you may not want to move down here until the 23rd. Just to let you know. Have a great day! Shirley 
Hello everyone: Start practicing!  We are going to have an outing and volleyball game for the Research employees and their families!. 
Good morning all: The question has arisen as to whether Enron has ""personal days"", that, you can take in case of repair problems at home; car problems; sick spouse, sick child, etc. I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is ""no"", but they can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor.  I talked this over with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed two (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business and not have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence. If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled), please let me know when you are going to take these days.  If an emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you are taking a personal day.  It will be coded on your time sheet. These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, ""funeral leave"", ""family leave"", or ""civic duty leave"".  They are just a way of being able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise. These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by all of us. If you have any questions, please call me. Shirley 3-5290 
Vince: Is the following all right to send to the group? ****************************************************************************** ******** Good morning all: The question has arisen as to whether Enron has ""personal days"", that, you can take in case of repair problems at home; car problems; sick spouse, sick child, etc. I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is ""no"", but they can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor.

Good morning all: I don't know where this request should go, would you please direct me in the right direction? Conference room EB 19C1 has one whole wall that is a white marker board. We would like to see about having a wall like this installed in 19C2.  Please let me know the costs and time involved.  Vince Kaminski has approved. Thanks and have a great day! Shirley 
Good afternoon Sandeep: I sent Krishna's expenses for his recent trip to our accounting dept. this morning and expensed them to the Research Group's Co and RC#. However, we need to be reimbursed for these expenses and I would like to know the best way to do this.  Our accounting dept. thought we should just send an invoice with the back up material to Dabhol Power Co. asking them to cut a check made payable to Enron Corp. and then it would be credited to our Co# and RC#. Please let me know if this is acceptable, and if so, who the invoice should be made out to and where I should send it. I appreciate your assistance in this matter. Have a great day! Shirley Crenshaw 713-853-5290 
Roy: I spoke with Vince and he approved your continuing your Spanish classes. If you need anything else, please let me know. 
Good morning Louis: Please cancel the ""Secom"" parking badge that was issued to Van Ngo for parking in the 777 Clay garage while she was working part time with the Research Group during the holidays.

Hello all! Since we all seemed to survive the ""Y2K"" bug, we are going to celebrate! Our ""Holiday Millenium"" party will be this Saturday. See attached for information, if you have questions, please call me at 3-5290. See you there! Shirley 
Iain: We went and looked at the Toshiba copier on the 32nd floor and while it does not appear to be extremely fast, I believe it will work for the 19th floor.  I spoke with Vince Kaminski and he agreed with our getting this copier. 
FYI 
Dear Vince, As the holidays approach, I am excited by my coming break from classes but also about the opportunity to see everyone at Enron again and to work with you and them soon.  I am writing to let you know that I would be very happy to work at Enron over my break and I would like to plan out a schedule. My semester officially ends Dec. 20th but I may be out of town the week before Christmas.  I will be available the following three weeks, from Monday, Dec. 27 to Friday, Jan. 14.  Please let me know if during those three weeks, you would like me to work and for what dates you would need the most help so that we can arrange a schedule that would be most helpful to you and so that I can contact Andrea at ProStaff soon. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions about a possible work schedule for me. Give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very happy holiday season!  I look forward to seeing you soon. Sincerely, Van Ngo Ph: 713-630-8038 - att1.htm 
Good morning all.  We apologize that we are not going to be able to have our Holiday Party before the first of the year.   We wanted to use the Scout House in West University like we did last year and it was not available. Vince suggested that with the move and a lot of people taking vacation that we wait until after the first of the year.  This way you can take advantage of ""after Christmas sales""  for your gift!

Vince: I was confused also - but I think this is the computer we ordered for the new employee that is coming next week (Rakesh Bharati).  Phillip our IT floor tech said that the computer in the back room at EB1972G was very old and did not have much memory so I ordered a new one with an upgrade to bring it up to 196M (this is what Phillip said we need).  Also there is another computer back there that does not have much memory and we ordered an upgrade for it (Jason's).  I went ahead an did it so that they would be ready when the new employees come in. Maureen already has her upgrade. Shirley Vince J Kaminski 12/18/2000 03:58 PM 
Shirley, Is this an upgrade for Maureen? Vince 
Hi Sandy: Yes he does.  Actually in our group meeting today, Vince Kaminski said that he wants most of his group to have access.  I believe Stinson Gibner is working on the list.  Is there a way we could submit a request to incorporate a list of people to give them access?  They would need writing access also. Thanks! Shirley 
Vince: Maureen needed this access for her new lap top so she can take it with her on vacation.  There was no one here to approve it, so I approved it for you.  Hope that was ok. Have a great time! Shirley

Good morning all: Below is an email from Kevin Sweeney inquiring about a software demo that he thought might have been in our group.  If anyone had this demo, please let Vince know. Thanks! Shirley 
Vince, I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past. Thanks, Kevin 
Vince: The IT Migration team called and said that they need an email from you stating that you do not want your lap top ""Ghost upped""? (Not sure if this is the correct term).   They said they were supposed to do this to all computers during the migration process, but since you requested that they not do this, then they need an email from you with this request. You need to send the email to:     Kacee Downey/Enron@EnronXGate Thanks! 
Julie: I talked to both Maureen and Tanya and neither one want this service and have not been using it. Maureen told me that she told you a year ago that she did not want Telerate (when she was supporting Gary Hickerson's group on 30).  If that is the case, we probably need a refund. Let me know if there is anything that can be done about this. The only person in our group that wants Telerate is Jason Sokolov and I put in a request for that yesterday.  Please cancel everything else. Thanks! Shirley

Hi Mark: Please order an 800 MHZ machine with 512 MB of RAM, and a large (17""+) flat-screen monitor for Clayton Vernon.  Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is 100038.  (is the large screen a 17"" or a 20""?) If you need anything else, please let me know. Thanks Mark and have a great day! Shirley 3-5290 
Shirley, Yes, It will be  a swap of one machine for another. Vince Shirley Crenshaw 03/17/2000 12:17 PM 
Vince: Is this ok to order? 
Mark- Shirley will order an 800 MHZ machine with 512 MB of RAM, and a large (17""+) flat-screen monitor for me. Clayton Mark Davidson 03/17/2000 08:52 AM 
Clayton- Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  There are a couple of things to keep in mind: -Enron IT supports Enron equipment. 
Mark- I have developed a model for Enron that requires ultra-high-end PC performance (it does many calculations in Excel), and my boss has authorized me to buy whatever PC I need. I'm looking at the Compaq 850, but Richard (our floor rep) says no PC's over the 600 series will be supported by IT. I need to resolve this issue; we are sophisticated buyers, we know the type of machine we want, and we have the money to pay for it. Sincerely, Clayton Vernon Manager, Research

Hi Lyn: Alex Huang has requested a new PC and Vince Kaminski has ok'd it.  Please order the computer as listed below in Alex's request. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 
Shirley, OK. Vince 
Hi Shirley, I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not enough memory.  Twice I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. Their suggestion is to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III Processor at 800 MHz on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher level. Thank you very much. Best, Alex 
Lyn: Can you tell me the status on this order?  Alex is really feeling the pinch for this new computer. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290

Hi Iain: Got a questions for you?  We have a small copier in our Research area (a Minolta CSPro)  that stays on the blink somewhere, quite a bit of the time.  The temporary copier in 19K1 is a Kodak Image Source 50.  What is the difference in price of these two copiers?  Is there any way we could exchange the Minolta for the Image Source when you bring our permanent copier to 19K1? Please let me know.  We would like to do that if we can and it is not too much more money. Thanks and have a great day! Shirley

Julie: I talked to both Maureen and Tanya and neither one want this service and have not been using it.

Let me know if there is anything that can be done about this. The only person in our group that wants Telerate is Jason Sokolov and I put in a request for that yesterday.  Please cancel everything else. Thanks! Shirley 
Clifford: In reviewing our February EIS Billing Summary for Co#0413, CC#107043, I have several questions. Telerate: (February charges: $3,032,35) I polled the group and only one person has asked for Telerate and he is not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him. The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason Sokolov, unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate. Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is for Jason Sokolov. Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96) No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for Hector Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for it.  Please remove from the Research Cost Center. The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center. Clayton Vernon  No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center Brad Amoine  No longer with Enron   Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center Shalesh Ganjoo No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center I hope this is not too confusing! Please advise. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw 
Connie: In response to your email to Vince Kaminski of 3/19/01, the subject invoice was sent to our Accounting Dept. for payment on February 25, 2001.  We did not need the SPAV maintenance, so we deducted $1,600.00.  Did you receive a payment in the amount of $4100.00 that could possibly have been payment for this invoice? I have left a message for our accounting dept. to see exactly when the invoice was paid and the check number.  As soon as I hear from them I will left you know. Best regards, Shirley Crenshaw Administrative Coordinator Enron Research Group 713-853-5290

HI Iris: May 17th is fine.  He will probably need to come in the night before (the 16th) and he can make a hotel reservation at the Doubletree or the Hyatt and tell them he is a guest of Enron and he will get a corporate rate.  We will reimburse him for room expense only.  He will need to pick up any miscellaneous room charges.   We will also reimburse him for his flight expense and cab fare. The Doubletree Telephone # is:  713-759-0202 and the Hyatt Telephone is: 713-654-1234. He can either leave his receipts with me when he is here or mail them to me and I will have a check cut.  I will need his SS#. If you have any more questions, please let me know. Thanks! Shirley

Vince- George just ""remembered"" the traders' meetings Monday and Wednesday afternoons at 3:30. He' s going to email you- I think Tuesday would ensure a turnout of traders as well as analysts. We  could easily have 20 people there from Power alone, and there's always Gas .... When you decide the time,  can you ask Shirley to reserve a conference room along the size of 30C1? Clayton

Ms. Crenshaw, Thank you for sending the bio so quickly.  It's exactly what I was looking for. We are planning to compile the conference speakers' papers for distribution to the participants.  While I will not need Dr. Kaminski's contribution for several weeks, an abstract of his presentation as soon as possible would be very useful to the conference organizers. I will also need the following information: - Dr. Kaminski's audio/video equipment requirements for his presentation - will he be joining the conference organizers and speakers for dinner on May 29? - which nights will he be staying in Toronto?  I will reserve a room at the conference hotel - any dietary restrictions or special requests Your help is much appreciated.

Dear Dr. Kaminski here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow Dr. V. Kaminski Enron P.O. Box 1188 Houston, Texas 77251-1188 Dear Dr. Kaminski March 12, 2001 I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories. The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April 27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel arrangements on this end if so desired. We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary equipment for your presentation. We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston. Sincerely W. Fitzgibbon

Vince: Michael Crew would like you to be a speaker on Wednesday, May 23rd instead of the 24th at the Rutgers Conference.  Is this ok? He is preparing the agenda and needs to know as soon as possible. Shirley 
Shirley, This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there for the Wednesday. I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince. We will show Vince's name as follows: Wincety J. Kaminski Managing Director - Research ENRON Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately. We would like to go to press today.  Failing that we can go to press tomorrow.  We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any corrections or changes.

Something to brighten your day!  And remember to keep in touch! ****************************************************************************************** Jake, the rancher, went one day to fix a distant fence. The wind was cold and gusty and the clouds rolled, gray and dense. As he pounded the last staples in and gathered tools to go, The temperature had fallen and the snow began to blow. When he finally reached his pickup, he felt a heavy heart, From the sound of that ignition, he knew it wouldn't start. So Jake did what most of us would do, if we'd have been there. He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer. As he turned the key for the last time, he softly cursed his luck. They found him three days later, frozen stiff in that old truck. Now Jake had been around in life, and done his share of roamin'. But when he saw Heaven, he was shocked - it looked just like Wyomin'. Of all the saints in Heaven, his favorite was St. Peter. [Now, this line, it ain't needed but it helps with rhyme and meter.] So they set and talked a spell or two, or maybe it was three, Nobody was keeping' score--- in Heaven time is free. ""I've always heard,"" Jake said to Pete, ""that God will answer prayer, But one time I asked for help, and, well He just plain wasn't there. Does God answer prayers of some, and ignores the prayers of others? That don't seem exactly square - I know all men are brothers. Or does he randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason? Maybe, it's the time of day, the weather or the season. Now I just ain't trying to act smart, it's just the way I feel,

You are invited to attend the following presentation: PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group. ?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. ?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such as Full Requirement  and load following contract. ?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals. ?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues. In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

Vince: Therese is involved with the ""Enron Kids"" (where you adopt a child for Christmas and spend $175.00 on them).  Do you think the group would be interested in sponsoring a couple of kids?  If we adopt 2 children (say a boy and a girl) at $175.00 each we would only need approximately $6.00 from each person.  If we adopted 3 kids (525.00) we would need approximately 10.00 per person.  What do you think?

Professor Martin: Attached is Vince's itinerary.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
John, I shall be in Paris and London next week. We can schedule a call sometimes next week. I shall ask my assistant to send you my itinerary. A late call (Paris time) would work for me. The time difference is 6 hours. This would mean a call sometimes around 3 - 4 p.m. our time. Please, indicate which day works best for you. Vince ""John D. Martin"" <J_Martin@baylor.edu> on 09/27/2000 09:45:50 AM 
Vince, Good morning.  Unfortunately I'll be in Milwaukee visiting Harley-Davidson about a book revision project both Thursday and Friday.  How about early next week.  I appreciate your patience with me.  When you suggested a time last week I was ""unprepared"" and embarassed to call and expose my ignorance.  Since then I have re-read the Enron Gas Services case and have a pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial sides of the business.  The other theme that I have heard many Enron speakers use is the ""de-regulation"" of markets.  This certainly played a factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business. If you'll let me know when it's convenient to call next week I'll have some notes put together.  I'm teaching a class for a colleague on Monday so anytime after that is great. Thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip. John p.s.  I saw that the Univ of New Orleans has an Energy Finance endowed chair for a financial economist open.  If you ever decide to move back to the life of poverty of an academic I would love to recommend you for such a post. At 08:26 AM 9/27/00 -0500, you wrote: > >John, > >What about Thursday, 10:30 a.m.?

Vince's wife and son were driving to California for his junior year at Stanford. They stopped in Phoenix and his wife got sick.  Vince is afraid he will have to fly out there and drive them on to Calif. Please accept our deepest apologies and we will reschedule for October, if it is ok.

Vince: When do you want to try and have Grant's party? Below is a list of people that he would like to invite. Shirley 
Shirley: Vince suggested I send you a list of non-research folks whom I would like to invite to the going away party. Ted Murphy George Hopley Bernie Aucoin Edith Cross Vlady Gorny Naveen Andrews Debbie Brackett. The above are the essentials.  I also like to invite the following, but I recognize that Vince may want to control costs, so I will leave it up to you and him to invite or not.

Hello everyone: =20 Just when you get used to something it changes! As you may have heard, Enron is implementing a new time entry system as par= t=20 of the July 1 SAP implementation.  Time entry for the June 16th- 30th perio= d=20 must be entered into SAP by 3:00 pm CST on June 30th.  As your Timekeeper, = I=20 will assist with this process and ensure that we meet this very important= =20 deadline. I will continue to do the time sheets for the 19th floor and for Osman and= =20 Samer. Sam Smith and/or Kevin Moore will be responsible for the timesheets for the= =20 weather group on the 32nd Floor. =20 Time can be entered in SAP in two ways: ? you can enter your time yourself using the new eHRonline feature; or,=20 ? timekeepers can enter time on your behalf. =20 If you are unsure as to which approach you should use, please call me. =20 Please remember that all time for this period must be submitted before 3:00= =20 pm CST, on June 30th. For those of you using eHRonline: First of all, congratulations on taking this next step toward Enron=01,s vi= sion=20 of empowering the employee.

Hopefully,= =20 you too, will receive value from having instant access to your personal=20 information. The new eHRonline functionality is: ? easy to use ? accessible through the Enron intranet at eHRonline.enron.com Using this feature, you can not only enter your own time, but also maintain= : ? your profile information (skills, education, and experience) ? home address ? phone numbers ? W-4 changes ? emergency contact information Additionally, you will be able to view your individual pay advice and benef= it=20 elections. You will receive your personal ID and password via e-mail from SAP_Security= =20 by June 22nd.  Because of the confidentiality of the information accessible= =20 using eHRonline, it is important that you keep your ID and password=20 confidential.  If you do not receive your information by the end of the day= =20 on June 22nd, please call the COE at (713) 345-4SAP to obtain your ID and= =20 password. The Apollo & Beyond team has teamed with EBS to deliver training on how to= =20 enter time using eHRonline via EBS=01, new product EnronCast.  This tool is= =20 available to you on your desktop.

Hello all: According to the email below, we are going to have to bill your cell phone= =20 invoices to your credit cards and receive reimbursement on an expense=20 report. If you want me to do this, I will be glad to - I will just need your credit= =20 card number that you want it billed to.  I think it will only have to be done on= e time and then they will automatically bill it to your card. Let me know. Thanks! Shirley 
The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe= w=20 years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increa= se=20 in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20 reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle. Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20 employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times= =20 they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes= e=20 cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, = we=20 try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20 employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20 increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20 productive than paying invoices. To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa= ry=20 for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and= =20 other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay= =20 for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc= tions=20 are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20 employee expense reports.=20 By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce= =20 the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of= =20 checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th= e=20 turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20 
Good morning Professor Ordonez: Vince and Stinson are both free at the present, on Wednesday, November 8th from 9:00 - 11:30 AM.  Please let me know if any time during this period would work for you. Regards, Shirley Crenshaw 
Hello everyone: Vince would like to bring Jaesoo Lew in next week for an exploratory interview with the Research Group.  The dates that would work best for us are: Wednesday, the 25th (AM), Thursday, 26th  (AM) and Friday, 27th (AM).  Please see if Mr. Lew is available for any of these times. Thanks! Shirley 3-5290 - vitae2.doc 
Shirley, I would like to  invite him to an interview next week. We should use his home phone number and/or private E-mail address. Vince 
Dear Dr. Kaminski My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee. Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach. The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++ programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too. I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron. My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration. Thank you very much.

Hello Kenneth: Nice talking to you this morning!  Below is your interview schedule for Monday, Oct. 30th and directions to the Enron Bldg..  Please let me know if you need any travel arrangements made. Coming from the northwest part of Houston, your best bet would be to take I-45 into town.  There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you will probably have to take the McKinney exit from I-45 (you will need to stay in the left lane as you approach town.  Exit McKinney to Smith Street, take a right on Smith Street go to Andrews Street, take a right on Andrews (the Enron bldg. is on the left), pass the Enron Bldg. cross ""Ruthvan"" (1st stop sign) and pull into the Allen Center Parking garage (Visitors area on your right).  Come to the security desk on the 1st floor of the Enron Bldg. and ask for me.  They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby on the 19th floor.

Vince, I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past. Thanks, Kevin 
Vince: Maureen needed this access for her new lap top so she can take it with her on vacation.  There was no one here to approve it, so I approved it for you.  Hope that was ok. Have a great time! Shirley

Martin: Lance will be out of town on the 6th of December and he suggested that you interview Jingming (Marshall) in his place (it is a telephone=20 interview). =20 Can you do that? Thanks! Shirley 
Marshall: Thanks for responding so quickly.   I have scheduled the following intervie= w: Wednesday, December 6 - 1:00 PM Houston time.  It will last approximately 1 hour.  We will call you at (605) 497-4045 unless otherwise instructed. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 713/853-5290. Best regards, Shirley Crenshaw ""Jingming 'Marshall' Yan"" <jmyan@stanford.edu> on 11/28/2000 12:59:55 PM 
Ms. Crenshaw, Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end, please let me know. Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your colleagues.
