Notice # 01-137 April 20, 2001 TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm) DATE: April 19, 2001 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o= f=20 rule changes, which are summarized below, to incorporate the implementation= =20 of enymexK. These rule changes, which have been filed with the CFTC and thu= s=20 may become effective at any time, will be implemented upon the launch of=20 enymexK. An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange=01,s= =20 website.  A hard copy =01&black-line=018 version of the rule changes, which= shows=20 changes from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson= =20 at (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange=01,s Legal Department. The rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,=20 accountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and = a=20 summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access. Trading Rules A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the roll-ou= t=20 of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS7 and=20 enymexK.  For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has been retitled= =20 and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system. EFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange=01,s rules th= at=20 respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded= =20 only on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts.  These rules wi= ll=20 now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions. Settlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E (=01&enymexK Settlement Price= =20 Procedures=018) was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for=20 electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement price= s=20 generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee, or if t= he=20 Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using the same=20 criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee.  However, one=20 difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no=20 settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid= =20 or higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25)= =20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available= =20 for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading.  By=20 comparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would= =20 allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe= rs=20 that would be protected in the settleme! nt! process. Position Limits, Accountability and Reporting.  With regard to the four=20 physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX Rule= s=20 9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months and a= =20 spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.  Also= ,=20 the Exchange=01,s current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl= e to=20 the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled enymexK contracts, t= he=20 rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract=20 months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a reporting level of 25=20 contracts for each enymexK contract, the same reporting level currently use= d=20 for many other Exchange contracts. However, NYMEX staff also has initiated= =20 discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt= =20 market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the= =20 cash-settled contracts. Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage, ne= w=20 Rule 9.04A (=01&enymexK Trading=018) permits brokerage to be done for enyme= xK=20 products.  Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member= =20 will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries= ,=20 even if there is a system malfunction. Arbitration Rules The Exchange=01,s arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Memb= er=20 enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a Non-Membe= r=20 enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan= ge=20 arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis. Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member=20 enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system. =20 Consistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a summar= y=20 disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when=20 necessary on an expedited basis. Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue = to=20 be subject to Exchange rules. If you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact Christophe= r=20 K. Bowen, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, NYMEX Legal Department= ,=20 at (212) 299-22200; or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, NYMEX= =20 Legal Department, at (212) 299-2207. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Trading Sessions 
Notice # 01-162 May 11, 2001 TO: All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions DATE:  May 11, 2001 =========================================================== Reminder Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End of Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading range for all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect): Crude Oil  20 ticks Heating Oil   50 ticks Unleaded Gas   50 ticks Natural Gas  50 ticks Clarification Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the close, there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible to trade that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above, the post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an expanded version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the following clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded during a post-close session (on any day of the week): 1. Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading in the post-close. 2. If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session, it may not be traded during the post-close. 3. It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the RTH session. If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

For example, prior t= o=20 an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new=20 customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Memb= er=20 by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b) the account number; (c) the brokerage rate; (d) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with= =20 the executing broker for that account; and (e) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20 account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or t= he=20 specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,= =20 date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department= =20 will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such=20 information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

Notice No. 01-171 May 17, 2001 TO: ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President SUBJECT: COPPER WAREHOUSE RATE CHANGE The following new rate for the handling out charges for copper has been submitted to the Exchange by Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. for its facilities located in Amarillo, Texas.  Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. is a COMEX Licensed Warehouse for the storage of copper deliverable against the COMEX Grade 1 Copper Futures Contract.  The new rate will become effective on July 1, 2001.  All other charges remain unchanged. RATES AND CHARGES FOR COPPER Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc.                Effective:  July 1, 2001 Handling Out Charge per Short Ton:  $  22.75 The following previously published charges for the storage and handling of copper at Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. remain unchanged. Handling Inbound per Short Ton:   $    0.00 Monthly Storage Charge per Short Ton:  $    3.60 Preparation of Warehouse Receipt:  $    0.00 Replacement of Each Warehouse Receipt:  $    0.00 Bill of Lading:     $    5.00 Insurance Premiums:    $    0.00 Loading Trucks & Trailers or Rail cars:  $    0.00 Please be advised that the warehouse, at its discretion, may require handling fees based on the new rates for all copper physically in storage as of the effective date.  That is, the old rates are not grandfathered for copper already in storage prior to July 1, 2001. Specific to handling out charges, invoices prepared by COMEX Clearing for warrants issued prior to July 1, 2001 should not call for reimbursements for handling out charges based on the new rates.  Reimbursements for these warrants should be based on the old handling out rate because the warehouse was prepaid based on the old handling out rate.  Though the warehouses have been prepaid the handling out charges based on the old rate, the party shipping the metal out on or after July 1, 2001, may owe the warehouse the difference between the old and new rates upon shipment, at the discretion of the warehouse.  Clearing Members are advised to carefully review invoices to ensure that reimbursement payments are not made for charges that have not actually been prepaid by the market short. Should you have any questions or require any additional information, please contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608, Nick Galati at 212-299-2920 or Ploumi Efkarpidis at 212-299-2334. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

The new SMM program with Koch in Alumin= um will=20 begin next week on Tuesday, May 29, 2001.  Please note that the terms of th= is=20 new SMM program differ from the old SMM program with AIG: ! Unlike the prior SMM program, Koch will not have any responsibilities=20 regarding maintaining a limit order book or otherwise executing customer=20 orders. ! Instead, during the RTH session, Koch must maintain an orderly two-sided= =20 market consisting of a current bid and offer quote for Koch=01,s proprietar= y=20 account on a RFQ basis as provided below. Trading up to Last Trading Day of Month Preceding Current Delivery Month ! Under normal market conditions, Koch must make a two-sided market for: (a) a minimum of  25 contracts at a maximum bid/ask spread of 20 points for= =20 the first 4 listed trading months; (b) any consecutive four-month calendar strip during the first 12 listed=20 contract months for 10 contracts per month at a maximum bid/ask spread of 2= 5=20 points; and (c) a minimum of 50 spread contracts at a maximum bid/ask spread of 20 poin= ts=20 for any and all inter-month spreads involving the first 12 listed trading= =20 months. ! In abnormal market conditions (as reasonably determined by Koch in good= =20 faith) Koch must make a two-sided market for the quantities listed above bu= t=20 at a bid/ask spread as determined by Koch in good faith. Trading Between First Notice Day and Last Trading Day of Current Delivery= =20 Month ! During this period, Koch will not be required to make quotes but instead= =20 using reasonable discretion must make efforts under normal conditions to=20 provide quotes. SMM Disclosure Statement ! Under the prior SMM program, which required the SMM to maintain a limit= =20 order book of customer orders, Member Firms were required to distribute a= =20 special SMM Disclosure Statement to a customer before that customer could= =20 trade in an Exchange contract that had been designated with a SMM facility,= =20 i.e., Aluminum. ! By contrast, because Koch as the new SMM will not be handling a limit ord= er=20 book, the SMM Disclosure Statement will no longer be relevant, and the=20 Exchange is discontinuing use of this disclosure statement for the new=20 Aluminum SMM program with Koch. If you have any questions concerning this new SMM program, please contact A= l=20 Getz, Director of Metals Research, Research Department, at (212) 299- 2608;= =20 Richard Strait, Director, Metals Marketing, Marketing Department, at (212)= =20 299-2335; or Michael Campanelli, Vice President, Floor Department, at (212)= =20 299-2072. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES 
June 7, 2001 Notice No. 01-191 TO: ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT RE: EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the Friday, June 15, trading session. For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots. The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the accountability levels. These are: Any one month         All months Crude oil  10,000   20,000 Unleaded gasoline 5,000   7,000 Heating oil  5,000   7,000 Natural gas  7,000   12,000 Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped. There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts). These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract. These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-338 October 3, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 3, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of New NYMEX Rule 6.40C: (""Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants"") Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new NYMEX Rule 6.40C (""Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants""), which is attached and is now in effect. 
October 4, 2000 Notice 00-344 Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Effective Sunday evening, October 8, 2000 (trade date October 9, 2000), the= =20 NYMEX ACCESS electronic trading system will begin  offering implied trading= =20 functionality, pending approval of necessary rule changes by the Commodity= =20 Futures Trading Commission.  This  feature will once again create ""implied""= =20 bids and offers in all futures, intra-market calendar spread, and 1:1=20 inter-commodity spread markets based on orders in related markets. Implied Orders in General Implied bids and offers are generated by the system based on individual=20 contract or spread orders that have been entered into the system.  For=20 example, if someone places a spread order to buy heating oil and sell crude= =20 oil at a set differential, the system will automatically seek the best offe= r=20 to sell heating oil and the best bid on crude oil and create an implied bid= =20 in heating oil and an implied offer in crude oil, based on the differential= =20 to the other market.  To do this, the system examines the outright  orders= =20 (orders directly entered into the system) and creates bids and offers  that= =20 are implied by the combination of specific outright orders.  The system the= n=20 creates the ""implied"" bid or offer and displays it as an order that may be= =20 traded against.  If a trader trades against this implied order, then the=20 outright orders that combined to create the implied order will trade. Two-Way Implication Between the Futures and the Spread Markets Orders entered into a commodity=01,s outright futures market will combine t= o=20 create implied spread orders both as calendar spreads and  1:1=20 inter-commodity spreads .  The reverse is also true, i.e., orders entered= =20 into the calendar spread market or the 1:1 inter-commodity spread market ca= n=20 combine with other futures orders to create implied futures orders. Implied Spread Orders Generated from Other Spread Orders Implied spread orders can be created from the combination of other spread= =20 orders.  For example, two separate calendar spread orders, one to buy a=20 January contract and sell a February contract, and another to buy a Februar= y=20 contract and sell a March contract, will create an implied order for a buy= =20 January/sell March spread.  The system will also generate implied=20 inter-commodity spread orders from the combination of calendar spread order= s=20 and other inter-commodity spread orders, and it will generate implied=20 calendar spread orders from the combination of inter-commodity spread order= s=20 and other calendar spread orders. Implied Order Creation and the Depth-of-Market Implied orders will be displayed only if the implied order=01,s price is th= e=20 best price in the market.  Consequently, a particular market=01,s best pric= e=20 volume may be composed of outright volume, implied volume, or a combination= =20 of outright and implied volume.  The depth-of-market view of a contract wil= l =20 only show this combination of implied and outright volume at the contract= =01,s=20 BEST bid and offer prices.  Implied orders with prices that are NOT at the= =20 best price for a contract will NOT show in the depth-of-market view. Please note that although the depth-of-market will not display volume from= =20 implied orders at prices other than the best, if a sweep order (an order to= =20 purchase a certain number of contracts within a predetermined price range) = is=20 entered with a price that would trade through  the undisplayed implied orde= r,=20 the implied order will be filled. Color Scheme to Distinguish Between Outright and Implied Orders If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to outright orders= ,=20 then the color  will be displayed in BLACK font.  If the volume of the best= =20 bid or offer is due completely to implied orders, then the color  will be= =20 displayed in RED font.  If the volume of the best bid or offer is a=20 combination, then the color  will be displayed in PURPLE font. (Warning: Do= =20 not change the Bid or Ask Color price cells -- which is done in the <View>= =20 <Preferences> <Attributes> screen --to the same colors that appear in the= =20 Implied Prices (Full) and (Part) fields -- also located in the same <View>= =20 <Preferences> <Attributes> screen.  If you do, you will not be able to view= =20 the implied prices.) Cross Orders Must Be Turned Off The current version of the implied functionality requires that cross order= =20 entry be turned off.  Therefore, there is no ability to directly enter a=20 cross order (a single order for a trade to be transacted for two customers= =20 accounts by the same broker) into the NYMEX ACCESSc system (This=20 functionality is planned as a future enhancement).  Orders should be entere= d=20 in the order received from the customers.  If you have two orders in hand= =20 that would normally be entered as a cross order, you should enter the order= =20 received first, wait ten seconds, and then enter the order received second. Options Orders This release does not support implied options orders in any options market. More Information If you have additional questions concerning the implied market functionalit= y,=20 please call the NYMEX ACCESSc Control Center (NACC) at 1-800-438-8616 US,= =20 0800-89-0813 (UK), or 212-299-2670 (Far East).  The NACC can provide you wi= th=20 a more descriptive document concerning the implied functionality and answer= =20 any questions that you may have. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

NYMEX ACCESS 
Notice No. 00-339 October 3, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 3, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of Amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.40A: Crossing of Orders on NYMEX ACCESSc ____________________________________________________________________ Please be advised that the CFTC has approved amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.40A. This rule, which is being retitled, has been titled as ""SIMULTANEOUS BUY AND SELL ORDERS ON NYMEX ACCESSc."" The rule amendments are attached and will become effective with the commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc  session on Sunday, October 8, 2000. This rule has allowed buy and sell orders from different principals for the same contract month and price to be entered into NYMEX ACCESSc  as a cross-trade. To ensure successful implementation of the new implied order functionality, the Exchange, effective with the October 8 NYMEX ACCESSc  session, is eliminating the functionality that allows for cross-trades to be posted on NYMEX ACCESSc . Commencing with the October 8 NYMEX ACCESSc  session, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator no longer may enter orders for different principals as a cross-trade into the system. Instead, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator shall enter such orders into the system as any other order on the basis of time of receipt of the order. In addition, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who enters a buy (sell) order for one principal into the system may not enter a sell (buy) order for another principal for the same commodity, month and price, or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price), unless the first order has rested in the Matching System for at least ten seconds. If you have any questions, please contact Tom LaSala, Vice President, Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.40A (An asterisk indicates additions; brackets indicate deletions.) Rule 6.40A.   *RESTRICTIONS ON* SIMULTANEOUS BUY AND SELL ORDERS ON NYMEX ACCESSc [ (A) An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who shall have at the same time both buy and sell orders of different principals for the same commodity, month and price or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price) at a price between the best bid and offer, or at a price on the best bid or on the best offer, as applicable, shall enter such orders as a cross-trade on the NYMEX ACCESSc system. ] *(A) An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator may not enter orders for different principals as a cross-trade into the system. Instead, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator shall enter orders into the system strictly on the basis of time of receipt of the orders. An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who has entered a buy (sell) order for one principal into the system shall not enter a sell (buy) order for another principal for the same commodity, month and price or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price) unless the first order has rested in the Matching System for at least ten seconds.* [ (B) The NYMEX ACCESSc System will post an announcement of the receipt of an order for a cross-trade. The announcement will be posted for 15 seconds. Resting orders in the system and new orders entered into NYMEX ACCESSc during the announcement period, as applicable, will be applied first for matching and allocation and any quantities remaining from the original simultaneous buy and sell orders will then be crossed. If, after the cross-trade is completed, any quantity remains unallocated, this side of the order will remain in the Matching System as a resting order.] __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Trading on NYMEX ACCESS 
Notice No. 00-347 October 6, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 6, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of Executive Committee Resolution Amending Price=20 Fluctuation Limits for Trading on NYMEX ACCESSc ____________________________________________________________________ Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive= =20 Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Resolution amends on a temporary= =20 basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied=20 order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc. (The price fluctuation limit rules th= at=20 are now in effect for the Exchange=01,s contracts will remain the same for= =20 trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours (""RTH"") on the trading=20 floor.)  The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the=20 commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday, October 8, 2000. By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi= ng=20 activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc, the Resolution reduces the possibility= =20 that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality.  The=20 Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with rega= rd to=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways: (1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange= =20 futures contract that has such limits) would be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with= =20 limits in effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the= =20 applicable rule. (2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months= =20 for energy contracts) would be applicable to all contract months for that= =20 futures contract. (3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer= ,=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately, rather than= =20 requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During the la= st=20 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market would be halted only far = as=20 long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits. Finally, notwithstanding the changes noted above, in the event that a=20 contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price=20 fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading, then the RTH session would ope= n=20 with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul= e,=20 even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc trading session. If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX ACCES= Sc=20 Operations, NYMEX ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX= =20 ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2679, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate=20 General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for= =20 each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that= =20 has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below= =20 with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc: The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20 futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the= =20 applicable rule. This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit= s)=20 shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract. In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide= =20 bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri= ce=20 fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20 except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe= e. =20 Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% o= f=20 the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched= =20 during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be= =20 halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f= or=20 five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESSc session at a price fluctuation limit= =20 applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session shall= =20 open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicabl= e=20 rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred during the NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc trading session. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-353 October 11, 2000 TO: COMEX Division Floor Community FROM: Michael Campanelli, Vice President, Floor Operations, COMEX Division RE: New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th= e=20 Trade Management System (TMS) on COMEX For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below, please ref= er=20 to: http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/ntm_353.htm Introduction As you are aware, in the near future, the Exchange plans to merge the two= =20 divisions onto one trade processing platform.  The COMEX Division will=20 replace its On-Line Trade Entry (OLTE) system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme= nt=20 System (TMS). While final details are being determined; certain procedural aspects of the= =20 transition process can begin. Therefore, effective immediately, the followi= ng=20 should be considered: Single Sided Concept The source document for TMS will be the trading card.  Floor staff will=20 collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da= ta=20 Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades.  The trading card= s=20 will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members (PCM=01,s); ins= tead=20 they will be retained by the Exchange (THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS=20 IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX).  Each sell side will generate a buy side.  The=20 broker=01,s staff will be responsible for Account Assignment, Trade Checkou= t and=20 Corrections (in addition, for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t= he=20 execution time). Implementation In accordance with the implementation of TMS, members must begin to use new= =20 trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input. Implementation Schedule The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur= e. WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL= Y,=20 to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place. This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation= =20 procedures and enable the Exchange=01,s Trade Processing staff to review th= e=20 handwriting/recordation techniques of the COMEX Division=01,s membership pr= ior=20 to launch.  During this interim period, if necessary staff will contact=20 members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures.  In= =20 addition, staff will begin to familiarize members=01, clerks with TMS=20 functionality. Spread Processing TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction.  To accomplis= h=20 this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t= he=20 trading card when he/she is the seller of the spread (see recordation=20 procedures noted below). This indication will inform data entry personnel t= o=20 enter the entire spread (buy and sell components).  Opposite buy spreads (n= ot=20 keyed by the Exchange) that are linked to a seller status will be generated= =20 by the system. NOTE: When submitting cards for data entry, the differential must be=20 indicated or it will be rejected.  If the differential is noted without=20 prices for either leg, the system will assign the appropriate market pricin= g=20 to both legs based on the most recent price reports.  If the differential i= s=20 noted along with the price of one of the legs, the system will assign an=20 appropriate price to the other leg. Recordation Procedures For the purpose of standardization within the community, the following=20 trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers: ALPHA CODES ONLY *TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes, therefore use only the=20 appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade=20 processing. SPREADS (MULTIPLE LEG TRADES) *Place the value of the spread (differential) in the bottom portion of each= =20 entry line=01,s center field.  Circle the spread value. This will inform da= ta=20 entry personnel that the trade is a spread (see e.g. 1). NOTE: Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result= =20 in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade. *Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the= =20 spread.  This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread (see e.= g.=20 2). *Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple= =20 leg spread is involved; for example:  Butterflies; this will convey that al= l=20 the components are part of one entity (see e.g. 3). CABINET TRADES *Place ""CAB"" or ""C"" in the premium column (see e.g. 4). CONVERSIONS *Place the option components on one line.  The futures component price must= =20 be written on the next line, across the Strike and Premium columns (see e.g= .=20 5). MATCHED ORDERS *Place ""MO"" in the price column (see e.g. 6). Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive= =20 the previous day=01,s settlement prices until the current day=01,s settleme= nt=20 prices are determined and immediately applied.

Notice No. 00-363 October 24, 2000 TO: All NYMEX Division Members All NYMEX Division Member Firms All NYMEX Division Clearing Firms FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: IRS Gives Exchange Favorable Private Letter Ruling on Demutualization= =20 Transaction The Internal Revenue Service yesterday gave the Exchange a favorable privat= e=20 letter ruling notifying the Exchange that there would be no tax consequence= s=20 to it or any of its members as a result of its demutualization. This ruling was the final approval required for the demutualization of the= =20 Exchange to take effect.  The plan was previously approved by the Securitie= s=20 and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and a=20 97.5% majority of the Exchange members. The demutualization plan, which calls for the equity in the Exchange to=20 remain with the seat-owners of its NYMEX Division, will make the Exchange t= he=20 first in New York to convert from a not-for-profit membership structure to = a=20 for-profit organization. Yesterday=01,s approval is the final step in repositioning the Exchange as = a=20 21st century business enterprise that will create and pursue profitable new= =20 opportunities, react rapidly and decisively in an increasingly competitive= =20 marketplace, and explore interest by outside investors. The Exchange expect= s=20 to announce an effective date for the transaction shortly. Once the demutualization is effective, the Exchange, a not-for-profit=20 membership corporation under New York law, will be reorganized as a=20 for-profit membership corporation under Delaware law and will be renamed Ne= w=20 York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.  A new stock-holding company named NYMEX=20 Holdings, Inc., will be formed to own all of the economic interests and mos= t=20 of the voting control in the for-profit membership corporation.  Each=20 existing NYMEX Division membership will be converted into one share of comm= on=20 stock in NYMEX Holdings, representing equity in the overall organization, a= nd=20 one membership in the Exchange representing trading privileges. The common stock and trading privileges will not be separable until a=20 majority of stockholders vote to permit separate trading of the common stoc= k=20 and trading rights. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

November 8, 2000 Notice No. 00-385 TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members FROM: Daniel Rappaport, Chairman of the Board RE: Exchange Sets Target Date for Demutualization The Exchange today set a target date of November 15 for its demutualization, which will make it the first exchange in New York to convert from not-for-profit membership structure to a for-profit structure. On October 24, the Exchange received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service notifying the Exchange that there would be no tax consequences to it or any of its members as a result of its demutualization. This ruling was the final approval required for the demutualization of the Exchange to take effect.  The plan was previously approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and a 97.5% majority of the Exchange members. The Exchange has moved decisively and rapidly in its pursuit of this demutualization and the various requisite regulatory approvals.  This approach is indicative of the progressive and innovative manner in which we will proceed as a for-profit corporation to reposition the Exchange as a 21st century business enterprise that will create and pursue profitable new opportunities, react rapidly and decisively in an increasingly competitive marketplace, and explore interest by outside investors. Pending certain legal notifications by November 15, the Exchange, a not-for-profit membership corporation under New York law, will be reorganized on that date as a for-profit membership corporation under Delaware law and will be renamed New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.  A new stock-holding company named NYMEX Holdings, Inc., will be formed to own all of the economic interests and most of the voting control in the for-profit membership corporation.  Each existing NYMEX Division membership will be converted into one share of common stock in NYMEX Holdings, representing equity in the overall organization, and one membership in the Exchange representing trading privileges. The common stock and trading privileges will not be separable until a majority of stockholders vote to permit separate trading of the common stock and trading rights. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-387 November 9, 2000 TO:  NYMEX Division Members FROM:  The Board of Directors RE:  Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan As you have been previously advised, on Wednesday, October 4, 2000 the Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan (the Plan) conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchange's pending demutualization plan.  On October 17, 2000, the Exchange held an open members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer any questions.  At the meeting, a number of members requested that the Board review its decision to use the 8.5% discount rate recommended by Deloitte & Touche in connection with termination of the Plan.  At the members meeting, it was agreed that the Board would review the discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting. Following the members meeting, the Exchange obtained two additional professional opinions from actuaries.  One opinion stated that the appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating the Plan should be between 7.8% and 8.1% and recommended using a discount rate of 8.0%.  The third opinion recommended that the appropriate range should be between 7.47% and 8.32% depending upon various credit and other related actuarial issues.  Each of the actuaries (including Deloitte & Touche) attended the Board meeting on November 2, 2000 to present the rationale in support of their respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by members of the Board. The Board was advised by the Exchange's General Counsel, as well as by two independent outside counsels, that in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, the Board should delegate authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan.  The Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount rate to a special committee (the Committee) composed of five Directors who did not have an interest in the Plan. After the Board formed the Committee, the members of the Committee, the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the matter privately.  After thoroughly reviewing the matter, the Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the termination of the Plan is 8.0%. On October 23, 2000, the Exchange received a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS.  At its meeting on November 2, 2000, the Board set a target closing date of November 15, 2000 for the demutualization transaction. Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan through December 31, 2000.  All other rules regarding eligibility and continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, in the event of termination, Qualified Participants (i.e. those participants with at least 15 years of Continuous Service, as defined in the Plan) are entitled to a payout equal to the net present value (NPV) of the scheduled ten-year benefit payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not terminated, to the extent of the assets held in trust for this purpose.  If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment to the Qualified Participants, those remaining assets are to be distributed to participants with Continuous Service (as defined in the Plan) between 10 years and 14 years.  These 10 - 14 year participants are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement age; the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of Continuous Service and the denominator is 15.  If there are not sufficient assets to pay each 10 -14 year participant their calculated sums, then each 10 - 14 year participant will receive a pro rata distribution.  These 10 - 14 year  participants must be members of record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be eligible to receive any distribution. The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent considerations with its actuaries, and all preliminary calculations should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the results of that review.  At this time, the Board believes that there are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her lump-sum benefit, based upon the approved a discount rate of 8.0%.  At this time, it appears that after making payments to Qualified Participants, the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro rata benefits to 10 - 14 year participants.  10 - 14 year participants can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the NPV benefit of their corresponding age (see attached Schedule) by the fraction of their whole years of service (10/15, 11/15, 12/15, 13/15, or 14/15) by twenty-six (26%) (which at this time appears to be the approximate  percentage of ""remaining assets"" available compared to the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated). Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received their last quarterly payment in October 2000.  Remaining obligations to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other Qualified Participants. It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure will be made in mid-January 2001. As of December 31, 2000 it is expected that total Plan assets will be approximately $33.5 million.  Regardless of the discount rate used, 100% of the assets of the Plan will be distributed.  Using a discount rate of 8.0% the Qualified Participants will receive approximately $30 million or ninety percent (90%) of the total Plan assets and 10 - 14 year participants will receive the balance. For illustrative purposes, and subject to the conditions noted above, the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated lump-sum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age indicated (but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits) as of December 31, 2000. In the event that any member has any questions in connection with termination of the Plan, please contact Chris Bowen at 299-2200 or Suellen Galish at 299-2215.  Copies of  both the original and amended Plans are available. Separate But Related Matter Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by others, neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments.  In accordance with Section 8 of the original Plan, in 1997 the amended Plan was approved by a three fourths (3/4) vote of the Board.  Section 8 of both the original and amended Plan provides that ""the Board of Directors of NYMEX may at anytime, amend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part, upon the affirmative vote of three fourths (3/4) of the entire Board"".  Section 8 of the Plan further specifically describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of termination.  Section 8(C) (1) states that the net present value of lump sum termination payments shall be ""calculated by using the applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion, in good faith, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties"".  Section 11, entitled Authorization of the Plan and which remains unchanged  from the original Plan, only applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in 1990. Again, contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made, neither the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV.  In fact, the estates of two deceased former members (Mel Miller and Leon Grappel) that erroneously have been reported to have received lump sum payments based upon a discount rate of 6.0% actually received payments based upon discount rates of  7.4% (paid in 1992) and 7.2% (paid in 1993), respectively. Inaccurate contentions and allegations diminish and undermine what we are seeking to achieve as a global financial institution. Attachment Age @ 12/31/00   NPV Benefit (8.0% discount) 59.5     $204,100 58.5       194,600 57.5       185,600 56.5       177,000 55.5       168,800 54.5       161,000 53.5       153,600 52.5       146,500 51.5       139,700 50.5       133,200 49.5       127,000 48.5       121,200 47.5       115,600 46.5       110,200 45.5       105,100 44.5       100,200 43.5         95,600 42.5         91,200 41.5         87,000 40.5         82,900 39.5         79,100 38.5         75,400 37.5         71,900 36.5         68,600 35.5         65,400 34.5         62,400 33.5         59,500 32.5         56,800 31.5         54,100 30.5         51,600 __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: CFTC Approves Amendments to Natural Gas Price Limit Rules DATE: December 7, 2000 Notice # 00-419 ______________________________________________ The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has received permission from the=20 Commodity Futures Trading Commission to expand the initial price limits of= =20 its natural gas futures contracts; create uniform limits across all months = of=20 trading; abbreviating the trading halt; and expand the new limits by 200%= =20 when the initial limit is reached. The amended rules, which are attached, will take effect for the opening of= =20 the open outcry tading session at 9:30 AM tomorrow. The Exchange announced this morning that the board last night voted to amen= d=20 the procedures so the new natural gas limit will be $1.000 per million=20 British thermal unit and if any contract month is traded, bid, or offered a= t=20 the limit for five minutes, the market is halted for 15 minutes.

(B)(1) Triggering Event and Temporary Trading Halt. If a market for any=20 contract month is traded or, is bid in the case of upward price moves or is= =20 offered in the case of downward price moves, for five (5) minutes=20 consecutively at the upper or lower price limit, as applicable, then a=20 Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, as a result of such Triggeri= ng=20 Event, the market will be given notice immediately that in two (2) minutes,= =20 there will be a fifteen (15) minute temporary trading halt in all contract= =20 months of that futures contract and the associated option contract=20 (""Temporary Trading Halt""). The market will remain open during this=20 two-minute notice period, and the commencement of the Temporary Trading Hal= t=20 shall not be affected by market activity occurring during this notice perio= d. (3) Expansion of Limits Following Temporary Trading Halt. Following the end= =20 of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, the market shall reopen in all=20 contract months of this futures contract.  When trading resumes, price=20 fluctuation limits for each contract month, except as otherwise provided in= =20 this rule, shall be expanded to $2.00 per MMBtu above and below the previou= s=20 day=01,s settlement price for such contract month; provided that if such Temporary Trading Halt occurs on either of the last t= wo=20 days of trading in the current delivery month, when trading resumes, there= =20 shall be no price fluctuation limits in effect for the remainder of the=20 trading day both for the current delivery month and for the next nearest=20 contract month to delivery. (4) Following resumption of trading after a Temporary Trading Halt, there= =20 shall be no additional trading halts and no further expansion of price limi= ts=20 for the remainder of the trading day. (C) Duration of Session Following Temporary Trading Halt.

Notice No. 00-423 December 12, 2000 TO: ALL NYMEX MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS ALL NYMEX CLEARING FIRMS ALL NYMEX OPERATIONS MANAGERS FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President SUBJECT: MARGIN RATE CHANGE 
NYMEX ACCESS 
Notice No. 00-421 December 12, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO:  ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM:  Neal L. Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE:  December 12, 2000 RE:  Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495; The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an=20 Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors= =20 and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app= ly=20 to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; (Resolution), remains in effect and will= =20 continue until February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by t= he=20 Exchange. As background, on October 6, 2000, the Exchange issued a Notice to Members= =20 (#347), advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this= =20 Resolution.  The Resolution, which became effective with the commencement o= f=20 the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session on Sunday, October 8, 2000, has amended on= a=20 temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those= =20 rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. The Resolution is included= =20 below. The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o= f=20 the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.  By=20 significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading= =20 activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;, the Resolution reduces the=20 possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied=20 functionality. The Resolution amends, on a temporary basis, Exchange price fluctuation lim= it=20 rules - but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495;. Thus, the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas= =20 are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution. The Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with= =20 regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; in four ways: (1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange= =20 futures contract that has such limits) are expanded to 200% of the initial= =20 and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac= t=20 months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with limits in= =20 effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the applicable= =20 rule. (2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months= =20 for energy contracts) is applicable to all contract months for that futures= =20 contract. (3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer= ,=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; generally would be halted immediately, rath= er=20 than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During t= he=20 last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session, the market would be halt= ed=20 only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price= =20 limits. (4) As a clarification, the Resolution suspends use of certain =01&haircuts= =018=20 narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices.  Specifically,= =20 NYMEX Rule 6.56 (Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX= =20 ACCESS&#61495;) establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba= se=20 point for price limits (until the actual settlement prices from the RTH=20 session can be input into the system.)  NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; will continue = to=20 use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution.  However, Rule 6.= 56=20 reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the= =20 period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for=20 establishing limits. Such =01&haircuts=018 are not being used under the Res= olution;=20 the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t= he=20 Resolution. Finally, the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange=20 practice.  In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;=20 traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular= =20 Trading Hours (RTH) trading, then the RTH session would open with expanded= =20 price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule.  This=20 practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution= =20 is in effect, even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading= =20 during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; trading session because the market had not= =20 hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. *  * * * As noted, these temporary amendments to the Exchange=01,s price limits shal= l=20 expire on February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the=20 Exchange. *  * * * If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495; Operations, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department, at (212)=20 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department, at (212) 299-2679, = or=20 Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for= =20 each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that= =20 has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below= =20 with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc: The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20 futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the= =20 applicable rule. This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit= s)=20 shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract. In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide= =20 bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri= ce=20 fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20 except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe= e. =20 Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% o= f=20 the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched= =20 during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be= =20 halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f= or=20 five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price fluctuation= =20 limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session= =20 shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the=20 applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred=20 during the NYMEX ACCESSc trading session. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-338 October 3, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 3, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of New NYMEX Rule 6.40C: (""Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants"") Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new NYMEX Rule 6.40C (""Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants""), which is attached and is now in effect. 
October 4, 2000 Notice 00-344 Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Effective Sunday evening, October 8, 2000 (trade date October 9, 2000), the= =20 NYMEX ACCESS electronic trading system will begin  offering implied trading= =20 functionality, pending approval of necessary rule changes by the Commodity= =20 Futures Trading Commission.  This  feature will once again create ""implied""= =20 bids and offers in all futures, intra-market calendar spread, and 1:1=20 inter-commodity spread markets based on orders in related markets. Implied Orders in General Implied bids and offers are generated by the system based on individual=20 contract or spread orders that have been entered into the system.  For=20 example, if someone places a spread order to buy heating oil and sell crude= =20 oil at a set differential, the system will automatically seek the best offe= r=20 to sell heating oil and the best bid on crude oil and create an implied bid= =20 in heating oil and an implied offer in crude oil, based on the differential= =20 to the other market.  To do this, the system examines the outright  orders= =20 (orders directly entered into the system) and creates bids and offers  that= =20 are implied by the combination of specific outright orders.  The system the= n=20 creates the ""implied"" bid or offer and displays it as an order that may be= =20 traded against.  If a trader trades against this implied order, then the=20 outright orders that combined to create the implied order will trade. Two-Way Implication Between the Futures and the Spread Markets Orders entered into a commodity=01,s outright futures market will combine t= o=20 create implied spread orders both as calendar spreads and  1:1=20 inter-commodity spreads .  The reverse is also true, i.e., orders entered= =20 into the calendar spread market or the 1:1 inter-commodity spread market ca= n=20 combine with other futures orders to create implied futures orders. Implied Spread Orders Generated from Other Spread Orders Implied spread orders can be created from the combination of other spread= =20 orders.  For example, two separate calendar spread orders, one to buy a=20 January contract and sell a February contract, and another to buy a Februar= y=20 contract and sell a March contract, will create an implied order for a buy= =20 January/sell March spread.  The system will also generate implied=20 inter-commodity spread orders from the combination of calendar spread order= s=20 and other inter-commodity spread orders, and it will generate implied=20 calendar spread orders from the combination of inter-commodity spread order= s=20 and other calendar spread orders. Implied Order Creation and the Depth-of-Market Implied orders will be displayed only if the implied order=01,s price is th= e=20 best price in the market.  Consequently, a particular market=01,s best pric= e=20 volume may be composed of outright volume, implied volume, or a combination= =20 of outright and implied volume.  The depth-of-market view of a contract wil= l =20 only show this combination of implied and outright volume at the contract= =01,s=20 BEST bid and offer prices.  Implied orders with prices that are NOT at the= =20 best price for a contract will NOT show in the depth-of-market view. Please note that although the depth-of-market will not display volume from= =20 implied orders at prices other than the best, if a sweep order (an order to= =20 purchase a certain number of contracts within a predetermined price range) = is=20 entered with a price that would trade through  the undisplayed implied orde= r,=20 the implied order will be filled. Color Scheme to Distinguish Between Outright and Implied Orders If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to outright orders= ,=20 then the color  will be displayed in BLACK font.  If the volume of the best= =20 bid or offer is due completely to implied orders, then the color  will be= =20 displayed in RED font.  If the volume of the best bid or offer is a=20 combination, then the color  will be displayed in PURPLE font. (Warning: Do= =20 not change the Bid or Ask Color price cells -- which is done in the <View>= =20 <Preferences> <Attributes> screen --to the same colors that appear in the= =20 Implied Prices (Full) and (Part) fields -- also located in the same <View>= =20 <Preferences> <Attributes> screen.  If you do, you will not be able to view= =20 the implied prices.) Cross Orders Must Be Turned Off The current version of the implied functionality requires that cross order= =20 entry be turned off.  Therefore, there is no ability to directly enter a=20 cross order (a single order for a trade to be transacted for two customers= =20 accounts by the same broker) into the NYMEX ACCESSc system (This=20 functionality is planned as a future enhancement).  Orders should be entere= d=20 in the order received from the customers.  If you have two orders in hand= =20 that would normally be entered as a cross order, you should enter the order= =20 received first, wait ten seconds, and then enter the order received second. Options Orders This release does not support implied options orders in any options market. More Information If you have additional questions concerning the implied market functionalit= y,=20 please call the NYMEX ACCESSc Control Center (NACC) at 1-800-438-8616 US,= =20 0800-89-0813 (UK), or 212-299-2670 (Far East).  The NACC can provide you wi= th=20 a more descriptive document concerning the implied functionality and answer= =20 any questions that you may have. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

NYMEX ACCESS 
Notice No. 00-339 October 3, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 3, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of Amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.40A: Crossing of Orders on NYMEX ACCESSc ____________________________________________________________________ Please be advised that the CFTC has approved amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.40A. This rule, which is being retitled, has been titled as ""SIMULTANEOUS BUY AND SELL ORDERS ON NYMEX ACCESSc."" The rule amendments are attached and will become effective with the commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc  session on Sunday, October 8, 2000. This rule has allowed buy and sell orders from different principals for the same contract month and price to be entered into NYMEX ACCESSc  as a cross-trade. To ensure successful implementation of the new implied order functionality, the Exchange, effective with the October 8 NYMEX ACCESSc  session, is eliminating the functionality that allows for cross-trades to be posted on NYMEX ACCESSc . Commencing with the October 8 NYMEX ACCESSc  session, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator no longer may enter orders for different principals as a cross-trade into the system. Instead, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator shall enter such orders into the system as any other order on the basis of time of receipt of the order. In addition, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who enters a buy (sell) order for one principal into the system may not enter a sell (buy) order for another principal for the same commodity, month and price, or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price), unless the first order has rested in the Matching System for at least ten seconds. If you have any questions, please contact Tom LaSala, Vice President, Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.40A (An asterisk indicates additions; brackets indicate deletions.) Rule 6.40A.   *RESTRICTIONS ON* SIMULTANEOUS BUY AND SELL ORDERS ON NYMEX ACCESSc [ (A) An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who shall have at the same time both buy and sell orders of different principals for the same commodity, month and price or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price) at a price between the best bid and offer, or at a price on the best bid or on the best offer, as applicable, shall enter such orders as a cross-trade on the NYMEX ACCESSc system. ] *(A) An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator may not enter orders for different principals as a cross-trade into the system. Instead, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator shall enter orders into the system strictly on the basis of time of receipt of the orders. An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who has entered a buy (sell) order for one principal into the system shall not enter a sell (buy) order for another principal for the same commodity, month and price or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price) unless the first order has rested in the Matching System for at least ten seconds.* [ (B) The NYMEX ACCESSc System will post an announcement of the receipt of an order for a cross-trade. The announcement will be posted for 15 seconds. Resting orders in the system and new orders entered into NYMEX ACCESSc during the announcement period, as applicable, will be applied first for matching and allocation and any quantities remaining from the original simultaneous buy and sell orders will then be crossed. If, after the cross-trade is completed, any quantity remains unallocated, this side of the order will remain in the Matching System as a resting order.] __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Trading on NYMEX ACCESS 
Notice No. 00-347 October 6, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 6, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of Executive Committee Resolution Amending Price=20 Fluctuation Limits for Trading on NYMEX ACCESSc ____________________________________________________________________ Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive= =20 Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Resolution amends on a temporary= =20 basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied=20 order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc. (The price fluctuation limit rules th= at=20 are now in effect for the Exchange=01,s contracts will remain the same for= =20 trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours (""RTH"") on the trading=20 floor.)  The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the=20 commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday, October 8, 2000. By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi= ng=20 activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc, the Resolution reduces the possibility= =20 that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality.  The=20 Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with rega= rd to=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways: (1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange= =20 futures contract that has such limits) would be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with= =20 limits in effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the= =20 applicable rule. (2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months= =20 for energy contracts) would be applicable to all contract months for that= =20 futures contract. (3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer= ,=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately, rather than= =20 requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During the la= st=20 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market would be halted only far = as=20 long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits. Finally, notwithstanding the changes noted above, in the event that a=20 contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price=20 fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading, then the RTH session would ope= n=20 with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul= e,=20 even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc trading session. If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX ACCES= Sc=20 Operations, NYMEX ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX= =20 ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2679, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate=20 General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for= =20 each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that= =20 has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below= =20 with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc: The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20 futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the= =20 applicable rule. This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit= s)=20 shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract. In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide= =20 bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri= ce=20 fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20 except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe= e. =20 Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% o= f=20 the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched= =20 during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be= =20 halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f= or=20 five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESSc session at a price fluctuation limit= =20 applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session shall= =20 open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicabl= e=20 rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred during the NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc trading session. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-350 October 10, 2000 TO: ALL NYMEX/COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL MEMBER FIRMS ALL CLEARING MEMBERS FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF RE: POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE NOVEMBER 2000 METAL AND ENERGY CONTRACTS [NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)] ______________________________________________________________________________ As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month. Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the November 2000 metals contracts must be completed prior to October 18, 2000. Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the respective contracts.

Provided, however, that a clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report. (2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, including the termination date.

Notice No. 00-353 October 11, 2000 TO: COMEX Division Floor Community FROM: Michael Campanelli, Vice President, Floor Operations, COMEX Division RE: New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th= e=20 Trade Management System (TMS) on COMEX For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below, please ref= er=20 to: http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/ntm_353.htm Introduction As you are aware, in the near future, the Exchange plans to merge the two= =20 divisions onto one trade processing platform.  The COMEX Division will=20 replace its On-Line Trade Entry (OLTE) system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme= nt=20 System (TMS). While final details are being determined; certain procedural aspects of the= =20 transition process can begin. Therefore, effective immediately, the followi= ng=20 should be considered: Single Sided Concept The source document for TMS will be the trading card.  Floor staff will=20 collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da= ta=20 Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades.  The trading card= s=20 will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members (PCM=01,s); ins= tead=20 they will be retained by the Exchange (THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS=20 IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX).  Each sell side will generate a buy side.  The=20 broker=01,s staff will be responsible for Account Assignment, Trade Checkou= t and=20 Corrections (in addition, for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t= he=20 execution time). Implementation In accordance with the implementation of TMS, members must begin to use new= =20 trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input. Implementation Schedule The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur= e. WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL= Y,=20 to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place. This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation= =20 procedures and enable the Exchange=01,s Trade Processing staff to review th= e=20 handwriting/recordation techniques of the COMEX Division=01,s membership pr= ior=20 to launch.  During this interim period, if necessary staff will contact=20 members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures.  In= =20 addition, staff will begin to familiarize members=01, clerks with TMS=20 functionality. Spread Processing TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction.  To accomplis= h=20 this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t= he=20 trading card when he/she is the seller of the spread (see recordation=20 procedures noted below). This indication will inform data entry personnel t= o=20 enter the entire spread (buy and sell components).  Opposite buy spreads (n= ot=20 keyed by the Exchange) that are linked to a seller status will be generated= =20 by the system. NOTE: When submitting cards for data entry, the differential must be=20 indicated or it will be rejected.  If the differential is noted without=20 prices for either leg, the system will assign the appropriate market pricin= g=20 to both legs based on the most recent price reports.  If the differential i= s=20 noted along with the price of one of the legs, the system will assign an=20 appropriate price to the other leg. Recordation Procedures For the purpose of standardization within the community, the following=20 trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers: ALPHA CODES ONLY *TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes, therefore use only the=20 appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade=20 processing. SPREADS (MULTIPLE LEG TRADES) *Place the value of the spread (differential) in the bottom portion of each= =20 entry line=01,s center field.  Circle the spread value. This will inform da= ta=20 entry personnel that the trade is a spread (see e.g. 1). NOTE: Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result= =20 in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade. *Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the= =20 spread.  This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread (see e.= g.=20 2). *Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple= =20 leg spread is involved; for example:  Butterflies; this will convey that al= l=20 the components are part of one entity (see e.g. 3). CABINET TRADES *Place ""CAB"" or ""C"" in the premium column (see e.g. 4). CONVERSIONS *Place the option components on one line.  The futures component price must= =20 be written on the next line, across the Strike and Premium columns (see e.g= .=20 5). MATCHED ORDERS *Place ""MO"" in the price column (see e.g. 6). Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive= =20 the previous day=01,s settlement prices until the current day=01,s settleme= nt=20 prices are determined and immediately applied.

Notice No. 00-363 October 24, 2000 TO: All NYMEX Division Members All NYMEX Division Member Firms All NYMEX Division Clearing Firms FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: IRS Gives Exchange Favorable Private Letter Ruling on Demutualization= =20 Transaction The Internal Revenue Service yesterday gave the Exchange a favorable privat= e=20 letter ruling notifying the Exchange that there would be no tax consequence= s=20 to it or any of its members as a result of its demutualization. This ruling was the final approval required for the demutualization of the= =20 Exchange to take effect.  The plan was previously approved by the Securitie= s=20 and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and a=20 97.5% majority of the Exchange members. The demutualization plan, which calls for the equity in the Exchange to=20 remain with the seat-owners of its NYMEX Division, will make the Exchange t= he=20 first in New York to convert from a not-for-profit membership structure to = a=20 for-profit organization. Yesterday=01,s approval is the final step in repositioning the Exchange as = a=20 21st century business enterprise that will create and pursue profitable new= =20 opportunities, react rapidly and decisively in an increasingly competitive= =20 marketplace, and explore interest by outside investors. The Exchange expect= s=20 to announce an effective date for the transaction shortly. Once the demutualization is effective, the Exchange, a not-for-profit=20 membership corporation under New York law, will be reorganized as a=20 for-profit membership corporation under Delaware law and will be renamed Ne= w=20 York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.  A new stock-holding company named NYMEX=20 Holdings, Inc., will be formed to own all of the economic interests and mos= t=20 of the voting control in the for-profit membership corporation.  Each=20 existing NYMEX Division membership will be converted into one share of comm= on=20 stock in NYMEX Holdings, representing equity in the overall organization, a= nd=20 one membership in the Exchange representing trading privileges. The common stock and trading privileges will not be separable until a=20 majority of stockholders vote to permit separate trading of the common stoc= k=20 and trading rights. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

November 8, 2000 Notice No. 00-385 TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members FROM: Daniel Rappaport, Chairman of the Board RE: Exchange Sets Target Date for Demutualization The Exchange today set a target date of November 15 for its demutualization, which will make it the first exchange in New York to convert from not-for-profit membership structure to a for-profit structure. On October 24, the Exchange received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service notifying the Exchange that there would be no tax consequences to it or any of its members as a result of its demutualization. This ruling was the final approval required for the demutualization of the Exchange to take effect.  The plan was previously approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and a 97.5% majority of the Exchange members. The Exchange has moved decisively and rapidly in its pursuit of this demutualization and the various requisite regulatory approvals.  This approach is indicative of the progressive and innovative manner in which we will proceed as a for-profit corporation to reposition the Exchange as a 21st century business enterprise that will create and pursue profitable new opportunities, react rapidly and decisively in an increasingly competitive marketplace, and explore interest by outside investors. Pending certain legal notifications by November 15, the Exchange, a not-for-profit membership corporation under New York law, will be reorganized on that date as a for-profit membership corporation under Delaware law and will be renamed New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.  A new stock-holding company named NYMEX Holdings, Inc., will be formed to own all of the economic interests and most of the voting control in the for-profit membership corporation.  Each existing NYMEX Division membership will be converted into one share of common stock in NYMEX Holdings, representing equity in the overall organization, and one membership in the Exchange representing trading privileges. The common stock and trading privileges will not be separable until a majority of stockholders vote to permit separate trading of the common stock and trading rights. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-387 November 9, 2000 TO:  NYMEX Division Members FROM:  The Board of Directors RE:  Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan As you have been previously advised, on Wednesday, October 4, 2000 the Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan (the Plan) conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchange's pending demutualization plan.  On October 17, 2000, the Exchange held an open members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer any questions.  At the meeting, a number of members requested that the Board review its decision to use the 8.5% discount rate recommended by Deloitte & Touche in connection with termination of the Plan.  At the members meeting, it was agreed that the Board would review the discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting. Following the members meeting, the Exchange obtained two additional professional opinions from actuaries.  One opinion stated that the appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating the Plan should be between 7.8% and 8.1% and recommended using a discount rate of 8.0%.  The third opinion recommended that the appropriate range should be between 7.47% and 8.32% depending upon various credit and other related actuarial issues.  Each of the actuaries (including Deloitte & Touche) attended the Board meeting on November 2, 2000 to present the rationale in support of their respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by members of the Board. The Board was advised by the Exchange's General Counsel, as well as by two independent outside counsels, that in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, the Board should delegate authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan.  The Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount rate to a special committee (the Committee) composed of five Directors who did not have an interest in the Plan. After the Board formed the Committee, the members of the Committee, the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the matter privately.  After thoroughly reviewing the matter, the Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the termination of the Plan is 8.0%. On October 23, 2000, the Exchange received a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS.  At its meeting on November 2, 2000, the Board set a target closing date of November 15, 2000 for the demutualization transaction. Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan through December 31, 2000.  All other rules regarding eligibility and continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, in the event of termination, Qualified Participants (i.e. those participants with at least 15 years of Continuous Service, as defined in the Plan) are entitled to a payout equal to the net present value (NPV) of the scheduled ten-year benefit payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not terminated, to the extent of the assets held in trust for this purpose.  If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment to the Qualified Participants, those remaining assets are to be distributed to participants with Continuous Service (as defined in the Plan) between 10 years and 14 years.  These 10 - 14 year participants are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement age; the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of Continuous Service and the denominator is 15.  If there are not sufficient assets to pay each 10 -14 year participant their calculated sums, then each 10 - 14 year participant will receive a pro rata distribution.  These 10 - 14 year  participants must be members of record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be eligible to receive any distribution. The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent considerations with its actuaries, and all preliminary calculations should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the results of that review.  At this time, the Board believes that there are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her lump-sum benefit, based upon the approved a discount rate of 8.0%.  At this time, it appears that after making payments to Qualified Participants, the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro rata benefits to 10 - 14 year participants.  10 - 14 year participants can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the NPV benefit of their corresponding age (see attached Schedule) by the fraction of their whole years of service (10/15, 11/15, 12/15, 13/15, or 14/15) by twenty-six (26%) (which at this time appears to be the approximate  percentage of ""remaining assets"" available compared to the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated). Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received their last quarterly payment in October 2000.  Remaining obligations to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other Qualified Participants. It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure will be made in mid-January 2001. As of December 31, 2000 it is expected that total Plan assets will be approximately $33.5 million.  Regardless of the discount rate used, 100% of the assets of the Plan will be distributed.  Using a discount rate of 8.0% the Qualified Participants will receive approximately $30 million or ninety percent (90%) of the total Plan assets and 10 - 14 year participants will receive the balance. For illustrative purposes, and subject to the conditions noted above, the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated lump-sum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age indicated (but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits) as of December 31, 2000. In the event that any member has any questions in connection with termination of the Plan, please contact Chris Bowen at 299-2200 or Suellen Galish at 299-2215.  Copies of  both the original and amended Plans are available. Separate But Related Matter Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by others, neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments.  In accordance with Section 8 of the original Plan, in 1997 the amended Plan was approved by a three fourths (3/4) vote of the Board.  Section 8 of both the original and amended Plan provides that ""the Board of Directors of NYMEX may at anytime, amend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part, upon the affirmative vote of three fourths (3/4) of the entire Board"".  Section 8 of the Plan further specifically describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of termination.  Section 8(C) (1) states that the net present value of lump sum termination payments shall be ""calculated by using the applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion, in good faith, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties"".  Section 11, entitled Authorization of the Plan and which remains unchanged  from the original Plan, only applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in 1990. Again, contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made, neither the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV.

TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: CFTC Approves Amendments to Natural Gas Price Limit Rules DATE: December 7, 2000 Notice # 00-419 ______________________________________________ The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has received permission from the=20 Commodity Futures Trading Commission to expand the initial price limits of= =20 its natural gas futures contracts; create uniform limits across all months = of=20 trading; abbreviating the trading halt; and expand the new limits by 200%= =20 when the initial limit is reached. The amended rules, which are attached, will take effect for the opening of= =20 the open outcry tading session at 9:30 AM tomorrow. The Exchange announced this morning that the board last night voted to amen= d=20 the procedures so the new natural gas limit will be $1.000 per million=20 British thermal unit and if any contract month is traded, bid, or offered a= t=20 the limit for five minutes, the market is halted for 15 minutes.  When=20 trading resumes, expanded limits are in place that allow the price to=20 fluctuate by $2.000 in either direction of the previous day's settlement=20 price. Currently, the market is halted for one hour if the price in one of the fir= st=20 two months is traded at $.750 for five minutes.  When the market reopens,= =20 those limits are extended to all months, but are moved to surround the=20 previous limit in place in the direction of the move. Under the amended rules, if a halt occurs during the last two days of tradi= ng=20 in a contract, when the market reopens, there are no price limits placed on= =20 either of the first two nearby contract months. NATURAL GAS: APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMIT RULES The rules below reflect the provisions that are being implemented.  A copy = of=20 the rules reflecting the changes made from the prior version of these rules= =20 can be obtained from the Exchange=01,s Legal Department. Rule 220.08. PRICES AND MINIMUM FLUCTUATION SIZE (A) Prices shall be quoted in dollars and cents per million British thermal= =20 units (MMBtu). The minimum price fluctuation shall be $.001 per MMBtu. Rule 220.08A. SPECIAL PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS  FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES (A) Initial Price Fluctuation Limits for All Contract Months. At the=20 commencement of each trading day, there shall be price fluctuation limits i= n=20 effect for each contract month of this futures contract of $1.00 per MMBtu= =20 above or below the previous day=01,s settlement price for such contract mon= th. (B)(1) Triggering Event and Temporary Trading Halt. If a market for any=20 contract month is traded or, is bid in the case of upward price moves or is= =20 offered in the case of downward price moves, for five (5) minutes=20 consecutively at the upper or lower price limit, as applicable, then a=20 Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, as a result of such Triggeri= ng=20 Event, the market will be given notice immediately that in two (2) minutes,= =20 there will be a fifteen (15) minute temporary trading halt in all contract= =20 months of that futures contract and the associated option contract=20 (""Temporary Trading Halt""). The market will remain open during this=20 two-minute notice period, and the commencement of the Temporary Trading Hal= t=20 shall not be affected by market activity occurring during this notice perio= d. (3) Expansion of Limits Following Temporary Trading Halt. Following the end= =20 of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, the market shall reopen in all=20 contract months of this futures contract.  When trading resumes, price=20 fluctuation limits for each contract month, except as otherwise provided in= =20 this rule, shall be expanded to $2.00 per MMBtu above and below the previou= s=20 day=01,s settlement price for such contract month; provided that if such Temporary Trading Halt occurs on either of the last t= wo=20 days of trading in the current delivery month, when trading resumes, there= =20 shall be no price fluctuation limits in effect for the remainder of the=20 trading day both for the current delivery month and for the next nearest=20 contract month to delivery. (4) Following resumption of trading after a Temporary Trading Halt, there= =20 shall be no additional trading halts and no further expansion of price limi= ts=20 for the remainder of the trading day. (C) Duration of Session Following Temporary Trading Halt.   When trading=20 resumes after a Temporary Trading Halt, trading generally shall continue=20 until the regularly scheduled closing time subject to the following=20 exceptions: 1) if, at the start of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, there is less= =20 than 15 minutes before the close, then, when trading resumes after the Temporary Trading=20 Halt, the trading session shall be expanded as necessary to provide for=20 fifteen (15) minutes of trading following the resumption of trading, and th= e=20 closing period shall be the final two minutes of trading of this 15-minute= =20 period of trading; 2) provided however that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed= =20 during  the closing period (on any day other than the last day of trading in the curren= t=20 delivery month), there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt for any contract= =20 month and no expansion of price limits for any contract month; and 3) provided further that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed= =20 during  the closing period on the last day of trading in the current delivery month,=20 following the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, trading shall resume for=20 thirty (30) minutes for all contract months. In such circumstances, the=20 closing range for the current delivery month shall include both the period= =20 from the start of the closing range to the start of the Temporary Trading= =20 Halt as well as the 30-minutes of trading following resumption of trading. (D) Application of Price Fluctuation Limits to NYMEX ACCESSc  The limits=20 described in this rule shall apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESSc, except as= =20 provided by NYMEX Rule 6.56 and except that: (1) if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed during the last ninety= =20 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc trading session, there shall be no Temporary=20 Trading Halt and no expansion of price limits during the remainder of such= =20 NYMEX ACCESSc trading session, and (2) there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt during a NYMEX ACCESSc trading= =20 session if, in the opinion of the President of the Exchange or his designee= ,=20 either the Triggering Event was not reflective of otherwise prevailing mark= et=20 conditions or a Temporary Trading Halt is unwarranted. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-423 December 12, 2000 TO: ALL NYMEX MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS ALL NYMEX CLEARING FIRMS ALL NYMEX OPERATIONS MANAGERS FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President SUBJECT: MARGIN RATE CHANGE 
NYMEX ACCESS 
Notice No. 00-421 December 12, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO:  ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM:  Neal L. Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE:  December 12, 2000 RE:  Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495; The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an=20 Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors= =20 and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app= ly=20 to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; (Resolution), remains in effect and will= =20 continue until February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by t= he=20 Exchange. As background, on October 6, 2000, the Exchange issued a Notice to Members= =20 (#347), advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this= =20 Resolution.  The Resolution, which became effective with the commencement o= f=20 the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session on Sunday, October 8, 2000, has amended on= a=20 temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those= =20 rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. The Resolution is included= =20 below. The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o= f=20 the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.  By=20 significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading= =20 activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;, the Resolution reduces the=20 possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied=20 functionality. The Resolution amends, on a temporary basis, Exchange price fluctuation lim= it=20 rules - but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495;. Thus, the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas= =20 are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution. The Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with= =20 regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; in four ways: (1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange= =20 futures contract that has such limits) are expanded to 200% of the initial= =20 and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac= t=20 months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with limits in= =20 effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the applicable= =20 rule. (2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months= =20 for energy contracts) is applicable to all contract months for that futures= =20 contract. (3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer= ,=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; generally would be halted immediately, rath= er=20 than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During t= he=20 last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session, the market would be halt= ed=20 only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price= =20 limits. (4) As a clarification, the Resolution suspends use of certain =01&haircuts= =018=20 narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices.  Specifically,= =20 NYMEX Rule 6.56 (Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX= =20 ACCESS&#61495;) establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba= se=20 point for price limits (until the actual settlement prices from the RTH=20 session can be input into the system.)  NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; will continue = to=20 use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution.  However, Rule 6.= 56=20 reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the= =20 period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for=20 establishing limits. Such =01&haircuts=018 are not being used under the Res= olution;=20 the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t= he=20 Resolution. Finally, the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange=20 practice.  In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;=20 traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular= =20 Trading Hours (RTH) trading, then the RTH session would open with expanded= =20 price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule.  This=20 practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution= =20 is in effect, even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading= =20 during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; trading session because the market had not= =20 hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. *  * * * As noted, these temporary amendments to the Exchange=01,s price limits shal= l=20 expire on February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the=20 Exchange. *  * * * If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495; Operations, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department, at (212)=20 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department, at (212) 299-2679, = or=20 Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for= =20 each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that= =20 has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below= =20 with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc: The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20 futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the= =20 applicable rule. This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit= s)=20 shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract. In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide= =20 bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri= ce=20 fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20 except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe= e. =20 Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% o= f=20 the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched= =20 during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be= =20 halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f= or=20 five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price fluctuation= =20 limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session= =20 shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the=20 applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred=20 during the NYMEX ACCESSc trading session. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice # 01-137 April 20, 2001 TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm) DATE: April 19, 2001 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o= f=20 rule changes, which are summarized below, to incorporate the implementation= =20 of enymexK. These rule changes, which have been filed with the CFTC and thu= s=20 may become effective at any time, will be implemented upon the launch of=20 enymexK. An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange=01,s= =20 website.  A hard copy =01&black-line=018 version of the rule changes, which= shows=20 changes from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson= =20 at (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange=01,s Legal Department. The rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,=20 accountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and = a=20 summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access. Trading Rules A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the roll-ou= t=20 of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS7 and=20 enymexK.  For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has been retitled= =20 and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system. EFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange=01,s rules th= at=20 respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded= =20 only on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts.  These rules wi= ll=20 now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions. Settlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E (=01&enymexK Settlement Price= =20 Procedures=018) was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for=20 electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement price= s=20 generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee, or if t= he=20 Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using the same=20 criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee.  However, one=20 difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no=20 settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid= =20 or higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25)= =20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available= =20 for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading.  By=20 comparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would= =20 allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe= rs=20 that would be protected in the settleme! nt! process. Position Limits, Accountability and Reporting.  With regard to the four=20 physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX Rule= s=20 9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months and a= =20 spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.  Also= ,=20 the Exchange=01,s current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl= e to=20 the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled enymexK contracts, t= he=20 rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract=20 months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a reporting level of 25=20 contracts for each enymexK contract, the same reporting level currently use= d=20 for many other Exchange contracts. However, NYMEX staff also has initiated= =20 discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt= =20 market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the= =20 cash-settled contracts. Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage, ne= w=20 Rule 9.04A (=01&enymexK Trading=018) permits brokerage to be done for enyme= xK=20 products.  Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member= =20 will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries= ,=20 even if there is a system malfunction. Arbitration Rules The Exchange=01,s arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Memb= er=20 enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a Non-Membe= r=20 enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan= ge=20 arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis. Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member=20 enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system. =20 Consistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a summar= y=20 disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when=20 necessary on an expedited basis. Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue = to=20 be subject to Exchange rules. If you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact Christophe= r=20 K. Bowen, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, NYMEX Legal Department= ,=20 at (212) 299-22200; or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, NYMEX= =20 Legal Department, at (212) 299-2207. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Trading Sessions 
Notice # 01-162 May 11, 2001 TO: All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions DATE:  May 11, 2001 =========================================================== Reminder Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End of Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading range for all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect): Crude Oil  20 ticks Heating Oil   50 ticks Unleaded Gas   50 ticks Natural Gas  50 ticks Clarification Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the close, there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible to trade that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above, the post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an expanded version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the following clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded during a post-close session (on any day of the week): 1. Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading in the post-close. 2. If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session, it may not be traded during the post-close. 3. It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the RTH session. If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice to Members No. 01-167 May 16, 2001 
Notice # 01-168 May 17, 2001 TO: All NYMEX and COMEX Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Revised Implementation Date for New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=01= 8) DATE: May 16, 2001 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Previously, in Notice to Members #01-154, the Exchange stated that new NYME= X=20 Rule 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=018) would go into effect on June 1, 2001.  The Exchang= e is=20 revising the implementation timeframe in order to provide Floor Members and= =20 Member Firms with additional time to obtain necessary records and become=20 compliant with the requirements.  Accordingly, please be advised that this= =20 rule now will go into effect beginning on the trade date of August 1, 2001.= =20 Further, it is anticipated that a similar rule will be implemented for the= =20 COMEX Division following final review and approval by the COMEX Governors= =20 Committee. ! In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will=20 define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing= =20 brokers, customers and Clearing Members. ! The term =01&executing broker=018 as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the reg= istered=20 billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitte= d. ! Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up=20 agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade=20 exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer= =20 that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule= =20 or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. ! The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to= =20 confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example, prior t= o=20 an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new=20 customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Memb= er=20 by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b) the account number; (c) the brokerage rate; (d) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with= =20 the executing broker for that account; and (e) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20 account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or t= he=20 specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,= =20 date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department= =20 will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such=20 information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard= =20 Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)= =20 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at= =20 (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance=20 Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928, NEW RULE 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=018) (Entire rule is new.) Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the= =20 responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing= =20 Members, the following rules shall define the respective=20 responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The =01&executi= ng=20 broker=018, as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member = Firm=20 or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. (A)   Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members (1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its=20 discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up f= or=20 a customer=01,s account from an executing broker, provided however, that th= e=20 executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the=20 Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be=20 received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice= =20 shall be retained by the Clearing Member. (2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (=01&DK=018) a trade on= ly if: =20 (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of= =20 this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing= =20 broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for whi= ch=20 the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for= =20 rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions o= f=20 Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly. (3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred= =20 for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and= =20 subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. = =20 Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing=20 Member, customer and the executing broker. (B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers (1) Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once= =20 an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker=01,s clerk must: (a) confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b) accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as=20 practicable; and (d) transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as=20 practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures. 2. Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing= =20 broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with= =20 the broker=01,s obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remain= s=20 responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules. 3.  Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member =20 Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order= =20 for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the=20 Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g) the account number; (h) the brokerage rate; (i) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with= =20 the executing broker for that account; and (j) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20 account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifi= cs=20 of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time,= =20 and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information= =20 shall be the basis for disciplinary action. 4. Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed=20 Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in= =20 accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker=01,s discret= ion,=20 reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  T= he=20 broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing Member(s) of any= =20 such rejection. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 01-171 May 17, 2001 TO: ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President SUBJECT: COPPER WAREHOUSE RATE CHANGE The following new rate for the handling out charges for copper has been submitted to the Exchange by Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. for its facilities located in Amarillo, Texas.  Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. is a COMEX Licensed Warehouse for the storage of copper deliverable against the COMEX Grade 1 Copper Futures Contract.  The new rate will become effective on July 1, 2001.  All other charges remain unchanged. RATES AND CHARGES FOR COPPER Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc.                Effective:  July 1, 2001 Handling Out Charge per Short Ton:  $  22.75 The following previously published charges for the storage and handling of copper at Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. remain unchanged. Handling Inbound per Short Ton:   $    0.00 Monthly Storage Charge per Short Ton:  $    3.60 Preparation of Warehouse Receipt:  $    0.00 Replacement of Each Warehouse Receipt:  $    0.00 Bill of Lading:     $    5.00 Insurance Premiums:    $    0.00 Loading Trucks & Trailers or Rail cars:  $    0.00 Please be advised that the warehouse, at its discretion, may require handling fees based on the new rates for all copper physically in storage as of the effective date.  That is, the old rates are not grandfathered for copper already in storage prior to July 1, 2001. Specific to handling out charges, invoices prepared by COMEX Clearing for warrants issued prior to July 1, 2001 should not call for reimbursements for handling out charges based on the new rates.  Reimbursements for these warrants should be based on the old handling out rate because the warehouse was prepaid based on the old handling out rate.  Though the warehouses have been prepaid the handling out charges based on the old rate, the party shipping the metal out on or after July 1, 2001, may owe the warehouse the difference between the old and new rates upon shipment, at the discretion of the warehouse.  Clearing Members are advised to carefully review invoices to ensure that reimbursement payments are not made for charges that have not actually been prepaid by the market short. Should you have any questions or require any additional information, please contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608, Nick Galati at 212-299-2920 or Ploumi Efkarpidis at 212-299-2334. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

The new SMM program with Koch in Alumin= um will=20 begin next week on Tuesday, May 29, 2001.  Please note that the terms of th= is=20 new SMM program differ from the old SMM program with AIG: ! Unlike the prior SMM program, Koch will not have any responsibilities=20 regarding maintaining a limit order book or otherwise executing customer=20 orders. ! Instead, during the RTH session, Koch must maintain an orderly two-sided= =20 market consisting of a current bid and offer quote for Koch=01,s proprietar= y=20 account on a RFQ basis as provided below.

REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES 
June 7, 2001 Notice No. 01-191 TO: ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT RE: EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the Friday, June 15, trading session. For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots. The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the accountability levels. These are: Any one month         All months Crude oil  10,000   20,000 Unleaded gasoline 5,000   7,000 Heating oil  5,000   7,000 Natural gas  7,000   12,000 Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped. There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts). These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract. These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice # 01-186 June 1, 2001 TO: All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain Securities and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and COMEX Transactions DATE: June 1, 2001 =========================================================== 1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1, 2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit with their Clearing Members for margin purposes. 2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will serve as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for use on a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained from the Exchange's Clearing Department. 3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for Joint Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association as one of the Joint Beneficiaries. 4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under  applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidiary or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank parent or affiliate bank. As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions. Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit (LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions. Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule changes allow letters of credit to be used on a ""pass-through"" basis on both divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. It should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, as detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets may not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse. Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some time on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customers to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Members on either division: securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances; can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any one issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market value. Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more than 75% of the value of the commodity. If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.

(I) Arbitrage (1) For the purposes of Exchange margin requirements, an arbitrage position is a purchase or sale of an Exchange futures contract in one delivery month which futures contract is offset by a futures contract to sell or to purchase a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different delivery month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject to the rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage position, each contract long and short must be carried by the same member firm for the same account. (2) The Board of Directors, by resolution, may identify those futures contracts, that are executable on and/or subject to the rules of a different exchange, which shall be deemed to qualify as part of an arbitrage position. (3) The Board of Directors or its designee may set levels of margin for arbitrage positions at a rate less than applicable to outright positions; provided, however, that except for interdivision straddles, no such rate shall be lower than the rates established for clearing members' margins.

Deposits on the NYMEX Division 
Notice # 01-184 May 31, 2001 TO: All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Reminder on Use of Money Market Funds as Original Margin Deposits on the NYMEX Division DATE: May 31, 2001 =========================================================== This Notice is a reminder regarding certain rule changes and related policy guidelines that will go into effect on June 1, 2001 for the NYMEX Division.  The rule changes going into effect on June 1, 2001 on the NYMEX Division allow shares of certain money market mutual funds to be acceptable for purposes of original margin deposits. Corresponding rule changes for the COMEX Division  have also been approved by the NYMEX Board of Directors and filed with the CFTC; the changes for the COMEX Division will be implemented at a later date. Rule Amendments The amendments generally require that in order to be used for such purpose, a money market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must comply with CFTC Regulation ? 1.25.  For purposes of original margin, the Exchange's Clearing House will value such money market fund shares at 95% of their market value.  In addition, a Clearing Member's participation in any approved fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer shall be limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's total original margin obligations. Finally, no more than 25% of the total assets of an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin obligations at the Exchange. Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional guidelines that will be applicable to such funds. First, until further notice from the Exchange, the Board has determined to limit the number of money market funds available for this purpose to ten. Second, the Board will require that henceforth each fund applying for such status must have a minimum value of $5 billion.  Finally, each fund further must provide for same day payment if notification is made by 3:00 p.m. on that day. If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Joseph Sanguedolce, Director, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2855. AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 9.05 (""MARGINS"") (Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.) Rule 9.05. MARGINS *	*	*	* (E) Clearing Members may meet original margin calls by depositing: *(4) Shares in a money market mutual fund that complies with CFTC Regulation ?1.25 and that has been approved by the Board, subject to the following conditions: (i)	for purposes of original margin, such shares will be valued at 95% of market value; (ii)	a Clearing Member's participation in any approved fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer shall be limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's total original margin obligations; (iii)	no more than 25% of the total assets of an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin obligations at the Exchange.* [Shares of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.

Notice No. 01-201 June 14, 2001 Note: To view a properly formatted copy of this notice, please visit http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_201.htm TO: All Clearing Member Firms All Compliance Officers and Operations Managers FROM: Neal Wolkoff; Executive Vice-President RE: Amendment to ""Super Margin"" Calculation ___________________________________________________________________________ Currently, Clearing Member firms are required to post original margin based on the gross positions of their customers. The margin requirement is calculated using the ""SPAN"" system which identifies two separate components for each portfolio, scan risk and option value. A portfolio's net short option value is added to the scan risk when determining margin requirements, while net long option value is subtracted from the scan risk amount. NYMEX Rule 9.20 uses the amount calculated by the SPAN system to determine a Clearing Member's position limits. Super margin is actually a supplement to a Clearing Member's original margin and is required if a firm's ""super risk"" calculation exceeds a certain limit based on a percentage of the firm's capital (150% - customer; 75% - house). Super risk is calculated by determining a Clearing Member's SPAN margin requirement based on net positions. A Clearing Member must deposit as super margin the excess of super risk over the firm's limit, in effect, paying double margin for that increment. *** Effective June 15, 2001, the formula currently used to determine a firm's super margin requirement will be amended so as to only include the ""scan risk"" of the overall net portfolio and omit the net option value. *** As such, the following amendments have been made to NYMEX Rule 9.20 NYMEX Rule 9.20. POSITION LIMITS (Additions are in Bold and Underlined; Deletions are in {Brackets} and Underlined) 
Notice No.:  01-203 June 25, 2001 
Notice # 01-168 May 17, 2001 TO: All NYMEX and COMEX Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Revised Implementation Date for New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") DATE: May 16, 2001 =========================================================== Previously, in Notice to Members #01-154, the Exchange stated that new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") would go into effect on June 1, 2001.  The Exchange is revising the implementation timeframe in order to provide Floor Members and Member Firms with additional time to obtain necessary records and become compliant with the requirements.  Accordingly, please be advised that this rule now will go into effect beginning on the trade date of August 1, 2001.	Further, it is anticipated that a similar rule will be implemented for the COMEX Division following final review and approval by the COMEX Governors Committee. !	In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members. !	The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. !	Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. !	The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a)	the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b)	the account number; (c)	the brokerage rate; (d)	the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e)	a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928, NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") (Entire rule is new.) Rule 9.11A	Give-Up Trades In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. (A)	  Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members (1).	Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice shall be retained by the Clearing Member. (2).	Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:  (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly. (3).	Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.  Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing Member, customer and the executing broker. (B)	Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers (1)	Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must: (a)	confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b)	accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c)	confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (d)	transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures. 2.	Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules. 3.	 Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member  Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f)	the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g)	the account number; (h)	the brokerage rate; (i)	the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (j)	a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. 4.	Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing Member(s) of any such rejection. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice # 01-137 April 20, 2001 TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm) DATE: April 19, 2001 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o= f=20 rule changes, which are summarized below, to incorporate the implementation= =20 of enymexK. These rule changes, which have been filed with the CFTC and thu= s=20 may become effective at any time, will be implemented upon the launch of=20 enymexK. An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange=01,s= =20 website.  A hard copy =01&black-line=018 version of the rule changes, which= shows=20 changes from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson= =20 at (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange=01,s Legal Department. The rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,=20 accountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and = a=20 summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access. Trading Rules A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the roll-ou= t=20 of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS7 and=20 enymexK.  For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has been retitled= =20 and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system. EFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange=01,s rules th= at=20 respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded= =20 only on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts.  These rules wi= ll=20 now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions. Settlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E (=01&enymexK Settlement Price= =20 Procedures=018) was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for=20 electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement price= s=20 generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee, or if t= he=20 Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using the same=20 criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee.  However, one=20 difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no=20 settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid= =20 or higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25)= =20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available= =20 for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading.  By=20 comparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would= =20 allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe= rs=20 that would be protected in the settleme! nt! process. Position Limits, Accountability and Reporting.  With regard to the four=20 physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX Rule= s=20 9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months and a= =20 spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.  Also= ,=20 the Exchange=01,s current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl= e to=20 the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled enymexK contracts, t= he=20 rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract=20 months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a reporting level of 25=20 contracts for each enymexK contract, the same reporting level currently use= d=20 for many other Exchange contracts. However, NYMEX staff also has initiated= =20 discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt= =20 market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the= =20 cash-settled contracts. Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage, ne= w=20 Rule 9.04A (=01&enymexK Trading=018) permits brokerage to be done for enyme= xK=20 products.  Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member= =20 will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries= ,=20 even if there is a system malfunction. Arbitration Rules The Exchange=01,s arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Memb= er=20 enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a Non-Membe= r=20 enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan= ge=20 arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis. Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member=20 enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system. =20 Consistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a summar= y=20 disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when=20 necessary on an expedited basis. Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue = to=20 be subject to Exchange rules. If you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact Christophe= r=20 K. Bowen, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, NYMEX Legal Department= ,=20 at (212) 299-22200; or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, NYMEX= =20 Legal Department, at (212) 299-2207. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 01-139 April 25, 2001 TO: All COMEX Division Brokers FROM: Michael Campanelli RE: Revised Policy / Exchange Provided Order Tickets Please be advised that at this time NYMEX will continue to provide order tickets to the COMEX division members.  The Exchange will not guarantee inventory on form types (futures/options, 3-part/4-part); it will only guarantee a supply of order tickets.  As the current inventory is depleted it is permissible to interchange remaining forms in stock.  There are no restrictions concerning the recordation of option orders on future order tickets or future orders being recorded on option order tickets; provided all relevant order information is recorded.  Should the current inventory become totally depleted, the Exchange will only provide a 3-part generic order ticket (no 4-part tickets and no future/option specific tickets will be provided).

Trading Sessions 
Notice # 01-162 May 11, 2001 TO: All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions DATE:  May 11, 2001 =========================================================== Reminder Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End of Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading range for all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect): Crude Oil  20 ticks Heating Oil   50 ticks Unleaded Gas   50 ticks Natural Gas  50 ticks Clarification Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the close, there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible to trade that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above, the post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an expanded version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the following clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded during a post-close session (on any day of the week): 1. Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading in the post-close. 2. If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session, it may not be traded during the post-close. 3. It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the RTH session. If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

The Exchang= e is=20 revising the implementation timeframe in order to provide Floor Members and= =20 Member Firms with additional time to obtain necessary records and become=20 compliant with the requirements.  Accordingly, please be advised that this= =20 rule now will go into effect beginning on the trade date of August 1, 2001.= =20 Further, it is anticipated that a similar rule will be implemented for the= =20 COMEX Division following final review and approval by the COMEX Governors= =20 Committee. ! In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will=20 define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing= =20 brokers, customers and Clearing Members. ! The term =01&executing broker=018 as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the reg= istered=20 billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitte= d. ! Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up=20 agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade=20 exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer= =20 that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule= =20 or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. ! The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to= =20 confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example, prior t= o=20 an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new=20 customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Memb= er=20 by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b) the account number; (c) the brokerage rate; (d) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with= =20 the executing broker for that account; and (e) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20 account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or t= he=20 specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,= =20 date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance Department= =20 will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such=20 information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard= =20 Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)= =20 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at= =20 (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance=20 Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928, NEW RULE 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=018) (Entire rule is new.) Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the= =20 responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing= =20 Members, the following rules shall define the respective=20 responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.

Notice must be=20 received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice= =20 shall be retained by the Clearing Member. (2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (=01&DK=018) a trade on= ly if: =20 (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of= =20 this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing= =20 broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for whi= ch=20 the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for= =20 rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions o= f=20 Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly. (3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred= =20 for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and= =20 subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. = =20 Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing=20 Member, customer and the executing broker. (B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers (1) Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once= =20 an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker=01,s clerk must: (a) confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b) accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as=20 practicable; and (d) transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as=20 practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures. 2.

The executing broker remain= s=20 responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules. 3.  Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member =20 Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order= =20 for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the=20 Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g) the account number; (h) the brokerage rate; (i) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with= =20 the executing broker for that account; and (j) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20 account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifi= cs=20 of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time,= =20 and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information= =20 shall be the basis for disciplinary action. 4. Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed=20 Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in= =20 accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker=01,s discret= ion,=20 reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  T= he=20 broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing Member(s) of any= =20 such rejection. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 01-171 May 17, 2001 TO: ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President SUBJECT: COPPER WAREHOUSE RATE CHANGE The following new rate for the handling out charges for copper has been submitted to the Exchange by Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. for its facilities located in Amarillo, Texas.  Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. is a COMEX Licensed Warehouse for the storage of copper deliverable against the COMEX Grade 1 Copper Futures Contract.  The new rate will become effective on July 1, 2001.  All other charges remain unchanged. RATES AND CHARGES FOR COPPER Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc.                Effective:  July 1, 2001 Handling Out Charge per Short Ton:  $  22.75 The following previously published charges for the storage and handling of copper at Dalby Moving & Storage Co., Inc. remain unchanged. Handling Inbound per Short Ton:   $    0.00 Monthly Storage Charge per Short Ton:  $    3.60 Preparation of Warehouse Receipt:  $    0.00 Replacement of Each Warehouse Receipt:  $    0.00 Bill of Lading:     $    5.00 Insurance Premiums:    $    0.00 Loading Trucks & Trailers or Rail cars:  $    0.00 Please be advised that the warehouse, at its discretion, may require handling fees based on the new rates for all copper physically in storage as of the effective date.  That is, the old rates are not grandfathered for copper already in storage prior to July 1, 2001. Specific to handling out charges, invoices prepared by COMEX Clearing for warrants issued prior to July 1, 2001 should not call for reimbursements for handling out charges based on the new rates.  Reimbursements for these warrants should be based on the old handling out rate because the warehouse was prepaid based on the old handling out rate.  Though the warehouses have been prepaid the handling out charges based on the old rate, the party shipping the metal out on or after July 1, 2001, may owe the warehouse the difference between the old and new rates upon shipment, at the discretion of the warehouse.  Clearing Members are advised to carefully review invoices to ensure that reimbursement payments are not made for charges that have not actually been prepaid by the market short. Should you have any questions or require any additional information, please contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608, Nick Galati at 212-299-2920 or Ploumi Efkarpidis at 212-299-2334. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

The new SMM program with Koch in Alumin= um will=20 begin next week on Tuesday, May 29, 2001.  Please note that the terms of th= is=20 new SMM program differ from the old SMM program with AIG: ! Unlike the prior SMM program, Koch will not have any responsibilities=20 regarding maintaining a limit order book or otherwise executing customer=20 orders. ! Instead, during the RTH session, Koch must maintain an orderly two-sided= =20 market consisting of a current bid and offer quote for Koch=01,s proprietar= y=20 account on a RFQ basis as provided below. Trading up to Last Trading Day of Month Preceding Current Delivery Month ! Under normal market conditions, Koch must make a two-sided market for: (a) a minimum of  25 contracts at a maximum bid/ask spread of 20 points for= =20 the first 4 listed trading months; (b) any consecutive four-month calendar strip during the first 12 listed=20 contract months for 10 contracts per month at a maximum bid/ask spread of 2= 5=20 points; and (c) a minimum of 50 spread contracts at a maximum bid/ask spread of 20 poin= ts=20 for any and all inter-month spreads involving the first 12 listed trading= =20 months. ! In abnormal market conditions (as reasonably determined by Koch in good= =20 faith) Koch must make a two-sided market for the quantities listed above bu= t=20 at a bid/ask spread as determined by Koch in good faith. Trading Between First Notice Day and Last Trading Day of Current Delivery= =20 Month ! During this period, Koch will not be required to make quotes but instead= =20 using reasonable discretion must make efforts under normal conditions to=20 provide quotes. SMM Disclosure Statement ! Under the prior SMM program, which required the SMM to maintain a limit= =20 order book of customer orders, Member Firms were required to distribute a= =20 special SMM Disclosure Statement to a customer before that customer could= =20 trade in an Exchange contract that had been designated with a SMM facility,= =20 i.e., Aluminum. ! By contrast, because Koch as the new SMM will not be handling a limit ord= er=20 book, the SMM Disclosure Statement will no longer be relevant, and the=20 Exchange is discontinuing use of this disclosure statement for the new=20 Aluminum SMM program with Koch. If you have any questions concerning this new SMM program, please contact A= l=20 Getz, Director of Metals Research, Research Department, at (212) 299- 2608;= =20 Richard Strait, Director, Metals Marketing, Marketing Department, at (212)= =20 299-2335; or Michael Campanelli, Vice President, Floor Department, at (212)= =20 299-2072. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-332 September 26, 2000 TO: All COMEX Members/Member Firms All COMEX Clearing Members All COMEX Floor Traders All COMEX Operations Managers FROM: Michael Campanelli, Vice President, Floor Operations, COMEX Division RE: Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day Please be reminded that Friday, September 29, 2000, is the First Notice Day, for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of October 2000 (the new spot month).

Notice No. 00-333 September 26, 2000 TO: ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President SUBJECT: COPPER WAREHOUSE RATE CHANGE The following new rate for the handling out charges for copper has been submitted to the Exchange by Southwest Commodity Warehouses, Inc. for its facilities located at 4619 N. Highway Drive, Tucson, Arizona and #1 Jacobus Road, San Manual, Arizona.  Southwest Commodity Warehouses, Inc. is a COMEX Licensed Warehouse for the storage of copper deliverable against the COMEX Grade 1 Copper Futures Contract.  The new rate will become effective on November 1, 2000.  All other charges remain unchanged. RATES AND CHARGES FOR COPPER Southwest Commodity Warehouses, Inc. Effective:  November 1, 2000 Handling Out Charge per Short Ton: $22.75 The following previously published charges for the storage and handling of copper at Southwest Commodity Warehouses, Inc. remain unchanged. Handling Inbound per Short Ton: $0.00 Monthly Storage Charge per Short Ton: $3.85 Preparation of Warehouse Receipt: $0.00 Replacement of Each Warehouse Receipt: $5.00 Bill of Lading: $ 5.00 Insurance Premiums: $ 0.00 Please be advised that the warehouses, at their discretion, may require handling fees based on the new rates for all copper physically in storage as of the effective date.  That is, the old rates are not grandfathered for copper already in storage prior to November 1, 2000. Specific to handling out charges, invoices prepared by COMEX Clearing for warrants issued prior to November 1, 2000 should not call for reimbursements for handling out charges based on the new rates.  Reimbursements for these warrants should be based on the old handling out rate because the warehouse was prepaid based on the old handling out rate.  Though the warehouses have been prepaid the handling out charges based on the old rate, the party shipping the metal out on or after November 1, 2000, may owe the warehouses the difference between the old and new rates upon shipment, at the discretion of the warehouse.  Clearing Members are advised to carefully review invoices to ensure that reimbursement payments are not made for charges that have not actually been prepaid by the market short. Should you have any questions or require any additional information, please contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-338 October 3, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 3, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of New NYMEX Rule 6.40C: (""Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants"") Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new NYMEX Rule 6.40C (""Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants""), which is attached and is now in effect. 
October 4, 2000 Notice 00-344 Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Effective Sunday evening, October 8, 2000 (trade date October 9, 2000), the= =20 NYMEX ACCESS electronic trading system will begin  offering implied trading= =20 functionality, pending approval of necessary rule changes by the Commodity= =20 Futures Trading Commission.  This  feature will once again create ""implied""= =20 bids and offers in all futures, intra-market calendar spread, and 1:1=20 inter-commodity spread markets based on orders in related markets. Implied Orders in General Implied bids and offers are generated by the system based on individual=20 contract or spread orders that have been entered into the system.  For=20 example, if someone places a spread order to buy heating oil and sell crude= =20 oil at a set differential, the system will automatically seek the best offe= r=20 to sell heating oil and the best bid on crude oil and create an implied bid= =20 in heating oil and an implied offer in crude oil, based on the differential= =20 to the other market.  To do this, the system examines the outright  orders= =20 (orders directly entered into the system) and creates bids and offers  that= =20 are implied by the combination of specific outright orders.  The system the= n=20 creates the ""implied"" bid or offer and displays it as an order that may be= =20 traded against.  If a trader trades against this implied order, then the=20 outright orders that combined to create the implied order will trade. Two-Way Implication Between the Futures and the Spread Markets Orders entered into a commodity=01,s outright futures market will combine t= o=20 create implied spread orders both as calendar spreads and  1:1=20 inter-commodity spreads .  The reverse is also true, i.e., orders entered= =20 into the calendar spread market or the 1:1 inter-commodity spread market ca= n=20 combine with other futures orders to create implied futures orders. Implied Spread Orders Generated from Other Spread Orders Implied spread orders can be created from the combination of other spread= =20 orders.  For example, two separate calendar spread orders, one to buy a=20 January contract and sell a February contract, and another to buy a Februar= y=20 contract and sell a March contract, will create an implied order for a buy= =20 January/sell March spread.  The system will also generate implied=20 inter-commodity spread orders from the combination of calendar spread order= s=20 and other inter-commodity spread orders, and it will generate implied=20 calendar spread orders from the combination of inter-commodity spread order= s=20 and other calendar spread orders. Implied Order Creation and the Depth-of-Market Implied orders will be displayed only if the implied order=01,s price is th= e=20 best price in the market.  Consequently, a particular market=01,s best pric= e=20 volume may be composed of outright volume, implied volume, or a combination= =20 of outright and implied volume.  The depth-of-market view of a contract wil= l =20 only show this combination of implied and outright volume at the contract= =01,s=20 BEST bid and offer prices.  Implied orders with prices that are NOT at the= =20 best price for a contract will NOT show in the depth-of-market view. Please note that although the depth-of-market will not display volume from= =20 implied orders at prices other than the best, if a sweep order (an order to= =20 purchase a certain number of contracts within a predetermined price range) = is=20 entered with a price that would trade through  the undisplayed implied orde= r,=20 the implied order will be filled. Color Scheme to Distinguish Between Outright and Implied Orders If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to outright orders= ,=20 then the color  will be displayed in BLACK font.  If the volume of the best= =20 bid or offer is due completely to implied orders, then the color  will be= =20 displayed in RED font.  If the volume of the best bid or offer is a=20 combination, then the color  will be displayed in PURPLE font. (Warning: Do= =20 not change the Bid or Ask Color price cells -- which is done in the <View>= =20 <Preferences> <Attributes> screen --to the same colors that appear in the= =20 Implied Prices (Full) and (Part) fields -- also located in the same <View>= =20 <Preferences> <Attributes> screen.  If you do, you will not be able to view= =20 the implied prices.) Cross Orders Must Be Turned Off The current version of the implied functionality requires that cross order= =20 entry be turned off.  Therefore, there is no ability to directly enter a=20 cross order (a single order for a trade to be transacted for two customers= =20 accounts by the same broker) into the NYMEX ACCESSc system (This=20 functionality is planned as a future enhancement).  Orders should be entere= d=20 in the order received from the customers.  If you have two orders in hand= =20 that would normally be entered as a cross order, you should enter the order= =20 received first, wait ten seconds, and then enter the order received second. Options Orders This release does not support implied options orders in any options market. More Information If you have additional questions concerning the implied market functionalit= y,=20 please call the NYMEX ACCESSc Control Center (NACC) at 1-800-438-8616 US,= =20 0800-89-0813 (UK), or 212-299-2670 (Far East).

Notice No. 00-339 October 3, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 3, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of Amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.40A: Crossing of Orders on NYMEX ACCESSc ____________________________________________________________________ Please be advised that the CFTC has approved amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.40A. This rule, which is being retitled, has been titled as ""SIMULTANEOUS BUY AND SELL ORDERS ON NYMEX ACCESSc."" The rule amendments are attached and will become effective with the commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc  session on Sunday, October 8, 2000. This rule has allowed buy and sell orders from different principals for the same contract month and price to be entered into NYMEX ACCESSc  as a cross-trade. To ensure successful implementation of the new implied order functionality, the Exchange, effective with the October 8 NYMEX ACCESSc  session, is eliminating the functionality that allows for cross-trades to be posted on NYMEX ACCESSc . Commencing with the October 8 NYMEX ACCESSc  session, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator no longer may enter orders for different principals as a cross-trade into the system. Instead, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator shall enter such orders into the system as any other order on the basis of time of receipt of the order. In addition, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who enters a buy (sell) order for one principal into the system may not enter a sell (buy) order for another principal for the same commodity, month and price, or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price), unless the first order has rested in the Matching System for at least ten seconds. If you have any questions, please contact Tom LaSala, Vice President, Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.40A (An asterisk indicates additions; brackets indicate deletions.) Rule 6.40A.   *RESTRICTIONS ON* SIMULTANEOUS BUY AND SELL ORDERS ON NYMEX ACCESSc [ (A) An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who shall have at the same time both buy and sell orders of different principals for the same commodity, month and price or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price) at a price between the best bid and offer, or at a price on the best bid or on the best offer, as applicable, shall enter such orders as a cross-trade on the NYMEX ACCESSc system. ] *(A) An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator may not enter orders for different principals as a cross-trade into the system. Instead, an Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator shall enter orders into the system strictly on the basis of time of receipt of the orders. An Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESSc Operator who has entered a buy (sell) order for one principal into the system shall not enter a sell (buy) order for another principal for the same commodity, month and price or for the same option (both puts or calls, with the same underlying contract for future delivery, expiration date and strike price) unless the first order has rested in the Matching System for at least ten seconds.* [ (B) The NYMEX ACCESSc System will post an announcement of the receipt of an order for a cross-trade. The announcement will be posted for 15 seconds. Resting orders in the system and new orders entered into NYMEX ACCESSc during the announcement period, as applicable, will be applied first for matching and allocation and any quantities remaining from the original simultaneous buy and sell orders will then be crossed. If, after the cross-trade is completed, any quantity remains unallocated, this side of the order will remain in the Matching System as a resting order.] __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Trading on NYMEX ACCESS 
Notice No. 00-347 October 6, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 6, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of Executive Committee Resolution Amending Price=20 Fluctuation Limits for Trading on NYMEX ACCESSc ____________________________________________________________________ Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive= =20 Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Resolution amends on a temporary= =20 basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied=20 order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc. (The price fluctuation limit rules th= at=20 are now in effect for the Exchange=01,s contracts will remain the same for= =20 trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours (""RTH"") on the trading=20 floor.)  The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the=20 commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday, October 8, 2000. By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi= ng=20 activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc, the Resolution reduces the possibility= =20 that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality.  The=20 Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with rega= rd to=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways: (1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange= =20 futures contract that has such limits) would be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with= =20 limits in effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the= =20 applicable rule. (2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months= =20 for energy contracts) would be applicable to all contract months for that= =20 futures contract. (3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer= ,=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately, rather than= =20 requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During the la= st=20 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market would be halted only far = as=20 long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits. Finally, notwithstanding the changes noted above, in the event that a=20 contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price=20 fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading, then the RTH session would ope= n=20 with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul= e,=20 even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc trading session. If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX ACCES= Sc=20 Operations, NYMEX ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX= =20 ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2679, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate=20 General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for= =20 each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that= =20 has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below= =20 with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc: The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20 futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the= =20 applicable rule. This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit= s)=20 shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract. In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide= =20 bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri= ce=20 fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20 except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe= e. =20 Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% o= f=20 the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched= =20 during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be= =20 halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f= or=20 five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESSc session at a price fluctuation limit= =20 applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session shall= =20 open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicabl= e=20 rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred during the NYM= EX=20 ACCESSc trading session. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-350 October 10, 2000 TO: ALL NYMEX/COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL MEMBER FIRMS ALL CLEARING MEMBERS FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF RE: POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE NOVEMBER 2000 METAL AND ENERGY CONTRACTS [NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)] ______________________________________________________________________________ As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month. Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the November 2000 metals contracts must be completed prior to October 18, 2000. Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the respective contracts.

Provided, however, that a clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report. (2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, including the termination date.

Notice No. 00-353 October 11, 2000 TO: COMEX Division Floor Community FROM: Michael Campanelli, Vice President, Floor Operations, COMEX Division RE: New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th= e=20 Trade Management System (TMS) on COMEX For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below, please ref= er=20 to: http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/ntm_353.htm Introduction As you are aware, in the near future, the Exchange plans to merge the two= =20 divisions onto one trade processing platform.  The COMEX Division will=20 replace its On-Line Trade Entry (OLTE) system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme= nt=20 System (TMS). While final details are being determined; certain procedural aspects of the= =20 transition process can begin. Therefore, effective immediately, the followi= ng=20 should be considered: Single Sided Concept The source document for TMS will be the trading card.  Floor staff will=20 collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da= ta=20 Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades.  The trading card= s=20 will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members (PCM=01,s); ins= tead=20 they will be retained by the Exchange (THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS=20 IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX).  Each sell side will generate a buy side.  The=20 broker=01,s staff will be responsible for Account Assignment, Trade Checkou= t and=20 Corrections (in addition, for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t= he=20 execution time). Implementation In accordance with the implementation of TMS, members must begin to use new= =20 trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input. Implementation Schedule The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur= e. WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL= Y,=20 to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place. This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation= =20 procedures and enable the Exchange=01,s Trade Processing staff to review th= e=20 handwriting/recordation techniques of the COMEX Division=01,s membership pr= ior=20 to launch.  During this interim period, if necessary staff will contact=20 members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures.  In= =20 addition, staff will begin to familiarize members=01, clerks with TMS=20 functionality. Spread Processing TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction.  To accomplis= h=20 this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t= he=20 trading card when he/she is the seller of the spread (see recordation=20 procedures noted below). This indication will inform data entry personnel t= o=20 enter the entire spread (buy and sell components).  Opposite buy spreads (n= ot=20 keyed by the Exchange) that are linked to a seller status will be generated= =20 by the system. NOTE: When submitting cards for data entry, the differential must be=20 indicated or it will be rejected.  If the differential is noted without=20 prices for either leg, the system will assign the appropriate market pricin= g=20 to both legs based on the most recent price reports.  If the differential i= s=20 noted along with the price of one of the legs, the system will assign an=20 appropriate price to the other leg. Recordation Procedures For the purpose of standardization within the community, the following=20 trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers: ALPHA CODES ONLY *TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes, therefore use only the=20 appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade=20 processing. SPREADS (MULTIPLE LEG TRADES) *Place the value of the spread (differential) in the bottom portion of each= =20 entry line=01,s center field.  Circle the spread value. This will inform da= ta=20 entry personnel that the trade is a spread (see e.g. 1). NOTE: Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result= =20 in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade. *Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the= =20 spread.  This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread (see e.= g.=20 2). *Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple= =20 leg spread is involved; for example:  Butterflies; this will convey that al= l=20 the components are part of one entity (see e.g. 3). CABINET TRADES *Place ""CAB"" or ""C"" in the premium column (see e.g. 4). CONVERSIONS *Place the option components on one line.  The futures component price must= =20 be written on the next line, across the Strike and Premium columns (see e.g= .=20 5). MATCHED ORDERS *Place ""MO"" in the price column (see e.g. 6). Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive= =20 the previous day=01,s settlement prices until the current day=01,s settleme= nt=20 prices are determined and immediately applied.

Notice No. 00-363 October 24, 2000 TO: All NYMEX Division Members All NYMEX Division Member Firms All NYMEX Division Clearing Firms FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: IRS Gives Exchange Favorable Private Letter Ruling on Demutualization= =20 Transaction The Internal Revenue Service yesterday gave the Exchange a favorable privat= e=20 letter ruling notifying the Exchange that there would be no tax consequence= s=20 to it or any of its members as a result of its demutualization. This ruling was the final approval required for the demutualization of the= =20 Exchange to take effect.  The plan was previously approved by the Securitie= s=20 and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and a=20 97.5% majority of the Exchange members. The demutualization plan, which calls for the equity in the Exchange to=20 remain with the seat-owners of its NYMEX Division, will make the Exchange t= he=20 first in New York to convert from a not-for-profit membership structure to = a=20 for-profit organization. Yesterday=01,s approval is the final step in repositioning the Exchange as = a=20 21st century business enterprise that will create and pursue profitable new= =20 opportunities, react rapidly and decisively in an increasingly competitive= =20 marketplace, and explore interest by outside investors. The Exchange expect= s=20 to announce an effective date for the transaction shortly. Once the demutualization is effective, the Exchange, a not-for-profit=20 membership corporation under New York law, will be reorganized as a=20 for-profit membership corporation under Delaware law and will be renamed Ne= w=20 York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.  A new stock-holding company named NYMEX=20 Holdings, Inc., will be formed to own all of the economic interests and mos= t=20 of the voting control in the for-profit membership corporation.  Each=20 existing NYMEX Division membership will be converted into one share of comm= on=20 stock in NYMEX Holdings, representing equity in the overall organization, a= nd=20 one membership in the Exchange representing trading privileges. The common stock and trading privileges will not be separable until a=20 majority of stockholders vote to permit separate trading of the common stoc= k=20 and trading rights. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

November 8, 2000 Notice No. 00-385 TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members FROM: Daniel Rappaport, Chairman of the Board RE: Exchange Sets Target Date for Demutualization The Exchange today set a target date of November 15 for its demutualization, which will make it the first exchange in New York to convert from not-for-profit membership structure to a for-profit structure. On October 24, the Exchange received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service notifying the Exchange that there would be no tax consequences to it or any of its members as a result of its demutualization. This ruling was the final approval required for the demutualization of the Exchange to take effect.  The plan was previously approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and a 97.5% majority of the Exchange members. The Exchange has moved decisively and rapidly in its pursuit of this demutualization and the various requisite regulatory approvals.  This approach is indicative of the progressive and innovative manner in which we will proceed as a for-profit corporation to reposition the Exchange as a 21st century business enterprise that will create and pursue profitable new opportunities, react rapidly and decisively in an increasingly competitive marketplace, and explore interest by outside investors. Pending certain legal notifications by November 15, the Exchange, a not-for-profit membership corporation under New York law, will be reorganized on that date as a for-profit membership corporation under Delaware law and will be renamed New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.  A new stock-holding company named NYMEX Holdings, Inc., will be formed to own all of the economic interests and most of the voting control in the for-profit membership corporation.  Each existing NYMEX Division membership will be converted into one share of common stock in NYMEX Holdings, representing equity in the overall organization, and one membership in the Exchange representing trading privileges. The common stock and trading privileges will not be separable until a majority of stockholders vote to permit separate trading of the common stock and trading rights. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-387 November 9, 2000 TO:  NYMEX Division Members FROM:  The Board of Directors RE:  Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan As you have been previously advised, on Wednesday, October 4, 2000 the Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan (the Plan) conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchange's pending demutualization plan.  On October 17, 2000, the Exchange held an open members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer any questions.  At the meeting, a number of members requested that the Board review its decision to use the 8.5% discount rate recommended by Deloitte & Touche in connection with termination of the Plan.  At the members meeting, it was agreed that the Board would review the discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting. Following the members meeting, the Exchange obtained two additional professional opinions from actuaries.  One opinion stated that the appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating the Plan should be between 7.8% and 8.1% and recommended using a discount rate of 8.0%.  The third opinion recommended that the appropriate range should be between 7.47% and 8.32% depending upon various credit and other related actuarial issues.  Each of the actuaries (including Deloitte & Touche) attended the Board meeting on November 2, 2000 to present the rationale in support of their respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by members of the Board. The Board was advised by the Exchange's General Counsel, as well as by two independent outside counsels, that in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, the Board should delegate authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan.  The Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount rate to a special committee (the Committee) composed of five Directors who did not have an interest in the Plan. After the Board formed the Committee, the members of the Committee, the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the matter privately.  After thoroughly reviewing the matter, the Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the termination of the Plan is 8.0%. On October 23, 2000, the Exchange received a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS.  At its meeting on November 2, 2000, the Board set a target closing date of November 15, 2000 for the demutualization transaction. Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan through December 31, 2000.  All other rules regarding eligibility and continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, in the event of termination, Qualified Participants (i.e. those participants with at least 15 years of Continuous Service, as defined in the Plan) are entitled to a payout equal to the net present value (NPV) of the scheduled ten-year benefit payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not terminated, to the extent of the assets held in trust for this purpose.  If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment to the Qualified Participants, those remaining assets are to be distributed to participants with Continuous Service (as defined in the Plan) between 10 years and 14 years.  These 10 - 14 year participants are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement age; the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of Continuous Service and the denominator is 15.  If there are not sufficient assets to pay each 10 -14 year participant their calculated sums, then each 10 - 14 year participant will receive a pro rata distribution.  These 10 - 14 year  participants must be members of record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be eligible to receive any distribution. The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent considerations with its actuaries, and all preliminary calculations should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the results of that review.  At this time, the Board believes that there are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her lump-sum benefit, based upon the approved a discount rate of 8.0%.  At this time, it appears that after making payments to Qualified Participants, the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro rata benefits to 10 - 14 year participants.  10 - 14 year participants can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the NPV benefit of their corresponding age (see attached Schedule) by the fraction of their whole years of service (10/15, 11/15, 12/15, 13/15, or 14/15) by twenty-six (26%) (which at this time appears to be the approximate  percentage of ""remaining assets"" available compared to the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated). Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received their last quarterly payment in October 2000.  Remaining obligations to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other Qualified Participants. It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure will be made in mid-January 2001. As of December 31, 2000 it is expected that total Plan assets will be approximately $33.5 million.  Regardless of the discount rate used, 100% of the assets of the Plan will be distributed.  Using a discount rate of 8.0% the Qualified Participants will receive approximately $30 million or ninety percent (90%) of the total Plan assets and 10 - 14 year participants will receive the balance. For illustrative purposes, and subject to the conditions noted above, the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated lump-sum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age indicated (but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits) as of December 31, 2000. In the event that any member has any questions in connection with termination of the Plan, please contact Chris Bowen at 299-2200 or Suellen Galish at 299-2215.  Copies of  both the original and amended Plans are available. Separate But Related Matter Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by others, neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments.  In accordance with Section 8 of the original Plan, in 1997 the amended Plan was approved by a three fourths (3/4) vote of the Board.  Section 8 of both the original and amended Plan provides that ""the Board of Directors of NYMEX may at anytime, amend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part, upon the affirmative vote of three fourths (3/4) of the entire Board"".  Section 8 of the Plan further specifically describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of termination.  Section 8(C) (1) states that the net present value of lump sum termination payments shall be ""calculated by using the applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion, in good faith, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties"".  Section 11, entitled Authorization of the Plan and which remains unchanged  from the original Plan, only applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in 1990. Again, contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made, neither the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV.  In fact, the estates of two deceased former members (Mel Miller and Leon Grappel) that erroneously have been reported to have received lump sum payments based upon a discount rate of 6.0% actually received payments based upon discount rates of  7.4% (paid in 1992) and 7.2% (paid in 1993), respectively.

Rule 6.21C provide= s=20 for report of EFS transactions to be given to the Exchange ""via NYMEX=20 ACCESS.""  However, this functionality still needs to be added to NYMEX=20 ACCESS.

Such reports of EFS transactions would be=20 subsequently disseminated to NYMEX ACCESS System Users through a bulletin= =20 message sent via NYMEX ACCESS. As a reminder, it is necessary for market participants to comply with the= =20 CFTC=01,s EFP-related reporting and recordkeeping regulations as if these= =20 regulations applied to EFS transactions.  Specifically, the Exchange will= =20 require: 1) Each Exchange member, futures commission merchant (""FCM""), and introduci= ng=20 broker (""IB"") to comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation=20 1.35(a) as if this regulation applied to EFS transactions and will further= =20 require each Exchange member, FCM, and IB to provide the required records t= o=20 the Exchange for inspection upon request; 2) Each customer to comply with the requirements of Commission=20 Regulation1.35(a-2)(2) as if this regulation applied to EFS transactions an= d=20 will further require each customer to provide the required records to the= =20 Exchange for inspection upon request; 3) Each Exchange clearing member, FCM, and foreign broker to comply with th= e=20 requirements of Commission Regulations 17.00(a)(1) and (2) as if these=20 regulations applied to EFS transactions, and NYMEX will further require eac= h=20 Exchange clearing member, FCM, and foreign broker to file the required=20 records with the Exchange; 4) Each trader who holds or controls a reportable futures position to compl= y=20 with the requirements of Commission Regulation 18.05 as if this regulation= =20 applied to EFS transactions, and NYMEX will further require each trader to= =20 provide the required records to the Exchange for inspection upon request; a= nd 5) Upon the request of the Commission, each FCM, IB, foreign broker, and=20 trader to comply with the requirements of Commission Regulations=20 24.03(e)(1)(iii) and (e)(2)(iv), and NYMEX will further require each FCM, I= B,=20 foreign broker, and trader to file the required records at the place and=20 within the time frame specified by the Exchange. If you have any questions concerning the operation of this program, pleas= e=20 contact Rick Taibi, Assistant Director, NYMEX ACCESS Operations, NYMEX ACCE= SS=20 Department, at (212) 299-2677, or George Henderson, Vice President, Floor= =20 Department, at (212) 299-2071.

EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP=20 TRANSACTIONS FOR FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ONLY ON VIA NYMEX ACCESS (A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)=20 consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and= a=20 futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer a= nd=20 seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of th= e=20 swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the future= s=20 contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such commodity)= . =20 The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately equivalent to the=20 quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap component of an EFS=20 transaction must comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation Part= =20 35 (Exemption of Swap Agreements).  The initial term of the pilot program= =20 shall be three years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21C. (2)The pilot program is available only to commercial market participants. F= or=20 purposes of this rule, a ""commercial market participant"" shall include a=20 person or entity that transacts business in the normal channels of commerce= =20 in the cash commodity or related commodity underlying the EFS posted on the= =20 Exchange and also shall include an entity that regularly maintains a book o= f=20 and acts as a dealer in swap transactions.

TO: All New York Mercantile Exchange Members FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: CFTC Approves Amendments to Natural Gas Price Limit Rules DATE: December 7, 2000 Notice # 00-419 ______________________________________________ The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has received permission from the=20 Commodity Futures Trading Commission to expand the initial price limits of= =20 its natural gas futures contracts; create uniform limits across all months = of=20 trading; abbreviating the trading halt; and expand the new limits by 200%= =20 when the initial limit is reached. The amended rules, which are attached, will take effect for the opening of= =20 the open outcry tading session at 9:30 AM tomorrow. The Exchange announced this morning that the board last night voted to amen= d=20 the procedures so the new natural gas limit will be $1.000 per million=20 British thermal unit and if any contract month is traded, bid, or offered a= t=20 the limit for five minutes, the market is halted for 15 minutes.  When=20 trading resumes, expanded limits are in place that allow the price to=20 fluctuate by $2.000 in either direction of the previous day's settlement=20 price. Currently, the market is halted for one hour if the price in one of the fir= st=20 two months is traded at $.750 for five minutes.  When the market reopens,= =20 those limits are extended to all months, but are moved to surround the=20 previous limit in place in the direction of the move. Under the amended rules, if a halt occurs during the last two days of tradi= ng=20 in a contract, when the market reopens, there are no price limits placed on= =20 either of the first two nearby contract months.

A copy = of=20 the rules reflecting the changes made from the prior version of these rules= =20 can be obtained from the Exchange=01,s Legal Department. Rule 220.08. PRICES AND MINIMUM FLUCTUATION SIZE (A) Prices shall be quoted in dollars and cents per million British thermal= =20 units (MMBtu). The minimum price fluctuation shall be $.001 per MMBtu. Rule 220.08A. SPECIAL PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS  FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES (A) Initial Price Fluctuation Limits for All Contract Months.

(B)(1) Triggering Event and Temporary Trading Halt. If a market for any=20 contract month is traded or, is bid in the case of upward price moves or is= =20 offered in the case of downward price moves, for five (5) minutes=20 consecutively at the upper or lower price limit, as applicable, then a=20 Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, as a result of such Triggeri= ng=20 Event, the market will be given notice immediately that in two (2) minutes,= =20 there will be a fifteen (15) minute temporary trading halt in all contract= =20 months of that futures contract and the associated option contract=20 (""Temporary Trading Halt""). The market will remain open during this=20 two-minute notice period, and the commencement of the Temporary Trading Hal= t=20 shall not be affected by market activity occurring during this notice perio= d. (3) Expansion of Limits Following Temporary Trading Halt. Following the end= =20 of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, the market shall reopen in all=20 contract months of this futures contract.  When trading resumes, price=20 fluctuation limits for each contract month, except as otherwise provided in= =20 this rule, shall be expanded to $2.00 per MMBtu above and below the previou= s=20 day=01,s settlement price for such contract month; provided that if such Temporary Trading Halt occurs on either of the last t= wo=20 days of trading in the current delivery month, when trading resumes, there= =20 shall be no price fluctuation limits in effect for the remainder of the=20 trading day both for the current delivery month and for the next nearest=20 contract month to delivery. (4) Following resumption of trading after a Temporary Trading Halt, there= =20 shall be no additional trading halts and no further expansion of price limi= ts=20 for the remainder of the trading day. (C) Duration of Session Following Temporary Trading Halt.   When trading=20 resumes after a Temporary Trading Halt, trading generally shall continue=20 until the regularly scheduled closing time subject to the following=20 exceptions: 1) if, at the start of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, there is less= =20 than 15 minutes before the close, then, when trading resumes after the Temporary Trading=20 Halt, the trading session shall be expanded as necessary to provide for=20 fifteen (15) minutes of trading following the resumption of trading, and th= e=20 closing period shall be the final two minutes of trading of this 15-minute= =20 period of trading; 2) provided however that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed= =20 during  the closing period (on any day other than the last day of trading in the curren= t=20 delivery month), there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt for any contract= =20 month and no expansion of price limits for any contract month; and 3) provided further that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed= =20 during  the closing period on the last day of trading in the current delivery month,=20 following the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, trading shall resume for=20 thirty (30) minutes for all contract months. In such circumstances, the=20 closing range for the current delivery month shall include both the period= =20 from the start of the closing range to the start of the Temporary Trading= =20 Halt as well as the 30-minutes of trading following resumption of trading. (D) Application of Price Fluctuation Limits to NYMEX ACCESSc  The limits=20 described in this rule shall apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESSc, except as= =20 provided by NYMEX Rule 6.56 and except that: (1) if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed during the last ninety= =20 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc trading session, there shall be no Temporary=20 Trading Halt and no expansion of price limits during the remainder of such= =20 NYMEX ACCESSc trading session, and (2) there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt during a NYMEX ACCESSc trading= =20 session if, in the opinion of the President of the Exchange or his designee= ,=20 either the Triggering Event was not reflective of otherwise prevailing mark= et=20 conditions or a Temporary Trading Halt is unwarranted. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 00-423 December 12, 2000 TO: ALL NYMEX MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS ALL NYMEX CLEARING FIRMS ALL NYMEX OPERATIONS MANAGERS FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President SUBJECT: MARGIN RATE CHANGE 
NYMEX ACCESS 
Notice No. 00-421 December 12, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO:  ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM:  Neal L. Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE:  December 12, 2000 RE:  Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495; The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an=20 Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors= =20 and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app= ly=20 to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; (Resolution), remains in effect and will= =20 continue until February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by t= he=20 Exchange. As background, on October 6, 2000, the Exchange issued a Notice to Members= =20 (#347), advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this= =20 Resolution.  The Resolution, which became effective with the commencement o= f=20 the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session on Sunday, October 8, 2000, has amended on= a=20 temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those= =20 rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. The Resolution is included= =20 below. The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o= f=20 the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.  By=20 significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading= =20 activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;, the Resolution reduces the=20 possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied=20 functionality. The Resolution amends, on a temporary basis, Exchange price fluctuation lim= it=20 rules - but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495;. Thus, the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas= =20 are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution. The Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with= =20 regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; in four ways: (1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange= =20 futures contract that has such limits) are expanded to 200% of the initial= =20 and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac= t=20 months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with limits in= =20 effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the applicable= =20 rule. (2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months= =20 for energy contracts) is applicable to all contract months for that futures= =20 contract. (3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer= ,=20 trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; generally would be halted immediately, rath= er=20 than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During t= he=20 last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session, the market would be halt= ed=20 only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price= =20 limits. (4) As a clarification, the Resolution suspends use of certain =01&haircuts= =018=20 narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices.  Specifically,= =20 NYMEX Rule 6.56 (Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX= =20 ACCESS&#61495;) establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba= se=20 point for price limits (until the actual settlement prices from the RTH=20 session can be input into the system.)  NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; will continue = to=20 use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution.  However, Rule 6.= 56=20 reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the= =20 period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for=20 establishing limits. Such =01&haircuts=018 are not being used under the Res= olution;=20 the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t= he=20 Resolution. Finally, the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange=20 practice.  In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;=20 traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular= =20 Trading Hours (RTH) trading, then the RTH session would open with expanded= =20 price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule.  This=20 practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution= =20 is in effect, even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading= =20 during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; trading session because the market had not= =20 hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. *  * * * As noted, these temporary amendments to the Exchange=01,s price limits shal= l=20 expire on February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the=20 Exchange. *  * * * If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX=20 ACCESS&#61495; Operations, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department, at (212)=20 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department, at (212) 299-2679, = or=20 Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207. APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for= =20 each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that= =20 has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below= =20 with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc: The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20 futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20 initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two= =20 contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the= =20 applicable rule. This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit= s)=20 shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract. In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide= =20 bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri= ce=20 fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20 except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe= e. =20 Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% o= f=20 the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched= =20 during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be= =20 halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f= or=20 five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price fluctuation= =20 limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session= =20 shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the=20 applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred=20 during the NYMEX ACCESSc trading session. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

(B)  The settlement price for the current delivery month and the most active month shall be the weighted average price (rounded to the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in the closing range. If no outright transactions occur in the closing range of either the current delivery month and the most active month, the settlement price for the applicable month shall be the last trade price, unless during the closing range a bid higher or offer lower than the last trade price is made.  In such event, such higher bid or lower offer shall be the settlement price. (C)  In all other delivery months, the settlement prices shall be determined based upon spread relationships between and among contract months, which relationships shall be determined in the judgment of the Settlement Price Committee with:  (a) greater weight given to spreads executed late in the trading day in large volumes, and (b) lesser weight given to (i) spreads traded in lesser volumes, (ii) spread bids and offers actively represented late in the trading day, and (iii) spread transactions, bids and offers from earlier in the trading day.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best outright bid, or higher than the best outright offer, that:  (a) was for at least 20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and had remained available for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading of that trading day. (D)  If any settlement price, determined pursuant to Paragraph[s] [(B)] [or] (C), is inconsistent with transactions that occurred during the closing range for other delivery months of the same futures contract or with other market information known to the Committee, the Committee may establish a settlement price at a level consistent with such other transactions or market information.  In such event, the Committee shall prepare a written record of the basis for any settlement price so established.

Notice No. 01-43 January 31, 2001 TO:  ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS FROM:  Neal L. Wolkoff Executive Vice President RE: Amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94 (Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts) DATE:  January 31, 2001 __________________________________________________________ Please be advised that the Exchange has amended COMEX Rule 4.94 (Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts). The amendments, which are attached below, become effective tomorrow on February 1, 2001. The amendments, which shall go into effect on February 1, 2001, eliminate the use of discretion by the applicable settlement committee in establishing the settlement price in the current delivery month and the most active month for the Copper futures contract. If you have any questions concerning the above, please contact Al Getz at 299-2608 or Brian Regan at (212) 299-2207. * * * * (Underlining indicates additions: bracketing in bold indicates deletions) Rule 4.94 Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts. (A)(i) The term ""base month"" shall mean the March, May, July, September, and December delivery months; (ii) the term ""most active month"" with respect to this rule and the rules of COMEX Chapters 11 and 17 shall mean the base month that is not the current delivery month, with the greatest reported open interest on the official COMEX daily open interest report. (B) The settlement price for the current delivery month and the most active month shall be the weighted average price (rounded to the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in the closing range. If no outright transactions occur in the closing range of either the current delivery month and the most active month, the settlement price for the applicable month shall be the last trade price, unless during the closing range a bid higher or offer lower than the last trade price is made.  In such event, such higher bid or lower offer shall be the settlement price. (C) In all other delivery months, the settlement prices shall be determined based upon spread relationships between and among contract months, which relationships shall be determined in the judgment of the Settlement Price Committee with:  (a) greater weight given to spreads executed late in the trading day in large volumes, and (b) lesser weight given to (i) spreads traded in lesser volumes, (ii) spread bids and offers actively represented late in the trading day, and (iii) spread transactions, bids and offers from earlier in the trading day.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best outright bid, or higher than the best outright offer, that:  (a) was for at least 20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and had remained available for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading of that trading day. (D) If any settlement price, determined pursuant to Paragraph [s] [(B)] [or] (C), is inconsistent with transactions that occurred during the closing range for other delivery months of the same futures contract or with other market information known to the Committee, the Committee may establish a settlement price at a level consistent with such other transactions or market information.  In such event, the Committee shall prepare a written record of the basis for any settlement price so established. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.

Notice No. 01-46 February 1, 2001 TO:  NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS FROM: Patrick F. Conroy, Senior Vice President SUBJECT: TERMINATION OF MEMBERS RETENTION AND RETIREMENT PLAN The remaining assets under the MRRP are being distributed to the participants with Continuous Service between 10 and 14 years under the Plan. Under the terms of the Plan, participants with more than 15 years of Continuous Service are entitled to receive a payout equal to the net present value of their calculated benefit, to the extent of assets held in trust.  Any remaining assets are to be distributed to the participants with Continuous Service between 10 and 14 years. In earlier notices, we estimated that there would be sufficient assets to pay approximately 26% of the partial benefits otherwise calculable.  However, after the final reconciliation of the census information used to calculate the original estimates, the liability associated with the fully vested participants increased substantially. The final calculations indicate that the remaining assets available to the participants with Continuous Services between 10 and 14 years will represent 14% of the otherwise calcu! la! ted benefits.  (In dollar terms, the liability to the fully-vested beneficiaries had increased by approximately $1.4 million.) In earlier notices we cautioned that the estimated benefits were subject to change based upon corrections to the participant database statistics. During the review process there were substantial corrections required.  A detailed explanation of the corrected liability amounts will be presented to the Board. If anyone would like to discuss their situation with me personally, I can be reached at ext. 8-2285. __________________________________________________ Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email.
