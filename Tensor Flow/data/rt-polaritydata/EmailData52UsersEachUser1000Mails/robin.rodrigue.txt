Darron, Here's the detail we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions.  The tabs labeled NSS1 Deals Killed and NSS2 Deals Killed are the PGL deals that were killed.  The sitara deals to book the 12 Bcf were 1194383, 1194384, 1194385, and 1194386. Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
Kam, I hear you get the pleasure of investigating this.   So here are the deals that were booked as physical but that Richard believes are financial. V63990 V67692 V73350 V82405 VK6281 VS8407 VY1883 Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
Susan, The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named M_Maggi. If you have any questions, give me a call. Thanks,

I still haven't caught her.  Supposedly her meetings end at 5, so if I don't get her then I'm leaving.  Have fun at dinner and don't stay too long when you come back. 
I'm now trained to avoid harrassment.   Actually it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be...not that it was exactly interesting, but it could have been much worse.  I was going to leave, but I just found out that Laura's in Houston.  Not only is she in Houston, she's in a conference room on this floor.  I keep peeking in the window to see if she's still in there.  I'm just hanging around now hoping to get a chance to talk to her. 
When David told me I had to go, I told him I already knew how to avoid harrassment...just stay away from he and Jeff.  But I guess since I have nothing else to do I might as well go. Gabriel Monroy 02/20/2001 11:14 AM 
Muahaaaaaaa, that is me laughing. I really laughed when i received this email.  No, nobody harasses me, so I am not going. I think somebody is harassing you. I will be here. Have fun, and save me some of that cake. Gabriel 
Hey do you have to go to the harrassment avoidance seminar?  We got an email saying we were required to attend one of the sessions.  So that's what I'm doing this afternoon.   Yippee! 
About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now. And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some. I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that you blew him off. R Gabriel Monroy 02/20/2001 10:31 AM 
Jaime just sent me an email apologizing because he could not find me. He said that he asked everybody (friends you have not met). A couple of Nicaraguans, and  some other colombians.  Before Jaime, Hector and I moved out of Austin, I used to hang out with all these people. Harry does not particularly like them, but Ramiro was also part of this group.  Anyways, Jaime kept asking for Harry's phone number and nobody knew his phone number, so he thinks he stood me up. Hmmm, what should I say. Should I say I was waiting for his call all weekend long, or just tell him the truth? Yeahh I want to try your King cake.  I am not hungry at all though. OUr assistants kept getting creative every day and our breakfast was getting better and better. I am not sure what happened last time they ordered. They must have been stoned. We had Peperoni calzone for BREAKFAST!!!!!!!. The worst part is that I ate one. My stomach is a little upset.  Too much junk food in less than 24 hours. 
I think harassing me is a very popular pass time around here. Gabriel Monroy 02/20/2001 10:08 AM 
hey, not much here.  None of my bosses are here, however, Tim left me some work to do and I am having a hard time comparing my results to what the analysts say they should be.  Tim would be disappointed if this is not finished by tomorrow. At least that is what I think, so I am keeping myself busy.  I have time to check my e-mail though, so keep writing.   For example, you can lie to me about how beautiful Lake Charles is, oopsss.  I think Jeff enjoys harassing you very very much. Anyways, if you find something interesting to tell me, let me know. 
Yeah, I already told Jeff I was going to have to log on and ask Charlene what's wrong with the Analyst HR.  I can't wait.  But it's like I told him, if you ask her a questions she doesn't want to answer (which is almost any legitimate question) she just pretends you asked something else and answers that. I have King cake down here if you want some.  It's pretty good, but I've had better.   Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night.  I told her about our cooking experience.  Don't worry I told her it was good. Do you have lunch plans? 
What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today. Hope you're having a good day.

She does seem pretty impressed that she's effectively the first person we've told.  I think she feels priviledged. Gabriel Monroy 02/16/2001 02:40 PM 
I got you now.  Was she surprised that we keot it a secret for so long? 
I don't think she thinks we kept it a secret very well.  She also didn't think 2 and a half months was very long. Gabriel Monroy 02/16/2001 02:40 PM 
I got you now.  Was she surprised that we keot it a secret for so long?

Apparently she thought Valentines was like a first date.  Now she knows we've 
Binh Knows...she quizzed me as soon as I sat down. 
Jeff said if we were going to spend that much we should go to the Carribean, so I'm going to research that further.  Let me know if you have any destination suggestions. 
Hey, Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke. Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent him an email with the flight information. Talk to ya later, Robin 
I'm just glad you sent it to the right person. Gabriel Monroy 03/07/2001 10:30 AM

Maybe if you had done more to relieve my boredom yesterday I would have been more willing to drive you back downtown.  I'm glad you made it back somewhat safely. Later RR Becky Pitre 02/15/2001 12:58 PM 
Thanks for not giving Shannon and I ride back downtown.  I  now have whip lash and a headache.  We were lucky to make it here alive.  B 
Hey Lynn, Thanks for checking up.  Laura and I spoke Tuesday.  She was going to contact HR and get back to me.  That's the last I've heard. Robin 
Nancy, I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen. BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently used region code.) Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for your help, Robin 
Nancy, The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be used.

I've decided that I'm going to quit worrying about them.  I finally heard from the VP yesterday.  Her son has been in the hospital, so she's been out of the office ever since I went up there.  So basically we've made no progress.  She's back now, though, so I'm hoping I'll know something soon. If I do end up going which is very likely I'm going to leave pretty soon. That's  the main reason I'm going home this weekend.  I'll let you know when I hear something. RR 
I'd like to be there around 7 if that's when it starts.  But we probably don't need to leave here until 6:30-6:45ish.  Just call me before you go to class and let me know when you'll get out and I'll meet you downstairs. I'm probably going to leave around 3:30 if things stay this calm. Bye 
There's no need to lie.  If you don't have anything interesting to tell me just admit it.  I'm bored not dillusional. Becky Pitre 02/14/2001 02:48 PM 
Get your self up here and help us!  This is interesting stuff.  How's that? Robin Rodrigue 02/14/2001 02:32 PM 
That does not qualify as something interesting.  You need to try harder. 
Hey Bags, It's good to hear from you.  I wish I could make it, but I'm going home for the weekend.  Hope you guys have fun. Bye, 
Hey, 
How's your day going?  Mine's actually been extremely boring!  If only I could have had this kind of day yesterday I could have actually done my GMAT homework...oh well.

I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today? So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, ""Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further.""  Funny, I didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been nice to chew someone out. Talk to ya later,

Sorry to hear you're having a bad day.  If it helps mine's not much better. I've been harrassed by at least half the company, I think.  Frank's out of the office, so I've got Sunil's replacement (who doesn't have a clue) calling me every two minutes, as well as Vlady calling, and the out of Control group calling, and Canada calling trying to get their p&l right......it's been nuts.  I was hoping today would be boring so I could do GMAT homework.  I would love to get out of the building for a little while.  Some lady just asked me for directions to get off this floor...  Does this seem scary to you??  Especially when you consider she was facing the neon EXIT sign down the hall.  Wow!!  Apparently everyone's lost their mind today. Hope your day gets better.

Hey girl, I'm really in about the same position I was in on Monday.  I've talked to the people in the office and they promise me they are still interested in having me up there.  But HR seems to be impeding the process at this point.  I'm just waiting for them to get back to me.  And the VP's son had surgery this week and apparently it was much more serious than they expected, so she's been unavailable all week.  She's supposed to be back in the office on Monday so hopefully she'll shake things up a little.  I definitely won't leave without saying goodbye.

Tom, It looks like everything ran perfectly.  I have attached a copy of the positions that were loaded into the system.  Let me know if you see any problems, but they seem to be in line with what you expected. Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
Good morning, Here is last night's benchmark report which includes our latest intramonth deals.  I also made the changes you suggested.  You should see MTM of around (79,000) and a volumetric position of approximately (600,000) for the intramonth deals. Please test the file at your first convenience. Thanks, Tom 
Huh? Gabriel Monroy 02/09/2001 10:42 AM 
thanks.  You should initiate a newswire service. You are very efficient. 
Here's the extent of what I know about Chicago. 
Thanks for the update. 
Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would have fun if you come.  Becky always tells stories about either her family or her husbands.  Since her family is from the hills of West Virginia and her husbands is from the swamps of Louisiana, she always has funny stories. Let me know if you change your mind. 
You need to quit smokin' crack!!! Gabriel Monroy 02/09/2001 09:58 AM 
You wanted me to be specific right? 
That was too weird...great minds think alike I guess.  I think our emails 
Irena, Someone delivered an envelope for you.  I put it in your top right desk drawer. 
Guten Morgen!!!  I've decided to learn German since I'm not having any luck with Spanish.  Oh my goodness....some ""lady"" just walked by with her pajamas on I think.  And apparently they were her pajamas from when she was in high school b/c not only are they hideously ugly they don't fit anymore!!  It's really scary. Someone just called with work for me to do, so I'll talk to ya later. I'm going to lunch with Shannon and Becky today if you want to come.  And yes you are really invited.  So let me know if you want to come and please be specific!! 
The FT-NEAST-WH books were set up in the Agg-Gas II portfolio, but never added to the AGG-GAS III or AGG-GAS IV portfolios.  Please add these books under the J_Mrha porfolio in AGG-GAS III and AGG-GAS IV. Thanks,

Guess what I found out this morning.   It looks like I'll be rotating out of this job just in time.  Jeff said Louise Kitchen is just like Shankman. Yikes...  We've (Jeff and I) not to tell Binh anything about her.  Lavo stresses her out, so I don't think she'd take the job if she knows it's only

I'm going home...can you believe it?  Give me a call when you get out of here. Talk to ya later, 
Not yet.  But I haven't given up yet. Gabriel Monroy 02/07/2001 01:39 PM 
Hey, Any news?? 
I heard from the admin in  Chicago.  She said Laura (the VP) is going to call the HR people and then call me sometime later today.  Maybe we'll actually make some progress today.  I'll let you know if I hear something. Now get back to work!! 
Yes I did get an apartment.  They are still doing some renovations, so I'll probably be in a hotel for a few days.  The owner said he would try to have it by the 12th, but you know how that goes.  I should be able to move in no later than the 16th though so that's not too bad.  If you could recommend a hotel I'd appreciate it. Thanks, Robin 
Frank, I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once Feb rolles to intramonth the ""From date"" on the calc is changed from the Jan 1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR calc not the post ids. Let me know if this doesn't answer your question. Robin Enron North America Corp. 
What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her ""I've been here longer, so you can work Valentines night.""  The only thing that makes me feel bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a while. Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute coffee break with Alejandra and I haven't done anything constructive since I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though. Te quiero.

At 11:15 wanna go to a 15 minute ab class and then go for a three mile run? No, I'm not trying to kill you.  B 
I have nothing to do either but I'm just surfing the web.  I'm not as dedicated as you are. Gabriel Monroy 02/06/2001 10:41 AM 
At that rate you will pay to get out of Houston right?     No worries, there is still another game on the 20th and the Season begins Feb 27th (this one is for points. The other two are Pre-season but still very competitive because they are organized by the league).  By the 27th, maybe you will already have finished GMAT. So, I guess I should not even worry about having told Purvi right?    Well, if you finish the benchmark early, you know where to go, but don't worry. I won't be expecting you. Let me know what you hear from Laura (if that is how you spell her name).  I will talk to the MD after lunch I guess. I'll let you know what the outcome was. There is absolutely nothing to do. I am educating myself by reading some things about Acquisitions. Gabriel 
Hey, It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all. Enough whining for now. Talk to ya later, 
Wei, I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View. Can you refresh the table to see if this position will pull into the Benchmark Agg_View table?  I am including the book id, post id, and position from yesterday.  Let me know if you need any more information. BOOK ID   POST ID POSITION INTRA-ONT-CAD-GDL  1062779 -477.7 contracts Thanks, 
You are one sick puppy!!  I hear your boss revoked your eating privileges. 
Yeah, give me a call.  I'm headed home to do GMAT homework. Gabriel Monroy 02/05/2001 05:18 PM 
Yes, Do you want me to call you after French so you can tell me all about it? 
Yeah, I heard.  It took an act of Congress and I'm not exactly thrilled. 
I already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the same as for Houston.  Which means that the prices should be comparable, so I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should have the ""offer"" in a couple of hours.  It's a big mess.  I'll have to tell you that story later.  My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the analyst HR moron.  If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in the mood for it!! I'll let you know what I find out. Robin Gabriel Monroy 02/05/2001 01:36 PM 
Well,  you are in a good position because you could sell your car but you don't necessarily have to.  In Enron terms this would be called a put option and we charge for it, so make sure you pay me premium.    The actual paperwork takes no time. It could be done in a day. Now, if your question was the time that you can actually find a potential buyer....well, that really depends on how much you want for it.  Have you decided on a  ""floor"".  In other words, decide how much is the minimum you would accept for your car. Another thing I would do is check the prices in Chicago.  Prices for cars vary a little  depending on the city. So see if comparable cars in Chicago are selling for less, that way, it might be a good opportunity to try to sell it here.  SInce you don't have to sell it, I would check the market very very well.  You don't need the money, and you don't need to sell it. You have the power. If you decide to advertise it,  don't mention anything about Chicago. I'll help you with research later. Gabriel 
You're right...that sounds just like Becky.  At least no one's sick this time!!  I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house.  And equally amazing is that Emily finally finished high school. I still haven't heard anything about Chicago.  I finally got the name of the HR rep here in Houston, so I'm going to begin the irritation tactic shortly. I'll just call every few minutes until they get tired of hearing their phone ring and finally answer.  And if that doesn't work I know where this lady's office is so I'll go pay her a friendly visit.  I'm determined to find something out. Talk to ya later, Robin Joanne Smith@ENRON 02/05/2001 12:34 PM 
Hey, I thought you might enjoy reading this if you have a few minutes to spare. It's from Becky, and it sounds just like her.  I thought you might get a kick out of what we are missing around there. Enjoyed lunch the other day.  We'll do it again sometime. Did you find out anything else about going to Chicago?  Keep me updated. Later, JoAnne 
Hey yourself, Glad you've gotten to work and have gotten settled.  Of course, now you're one of the working class.....sounds like you're gonna be busy.  We have been here-if anything, we're busier than ever.  The auditors are here ---yuck...and will be til the end of the year probably.  Oh well, nothing to hide. Emily is enrolled here-can you believe it?  and Zach decided to help out by cranking my truck last week.  Emily had left it in gear so now my utility room has a large opening in it that was not previously there.  He was used to cranking his dad's automatic car and  boy, did he get a surprise...Oh well, he's not hurt and the truck and utility room can be fixed. Had a birthday yesterday.  Jake took me to the Warehouse last night and I stuffed my face.  Really good.  Seems like you had one a few weeks ago, yourself.  Happy belated birthday.  Hope it was a good one.  Sounds like things are going great for you two-buying a house and everything.  Where is Shannon working?  Is he having to drive far to get to work? Guess I better get some of this junk rounded up.  Maybe he'll let us go a few minutes early.  I could handle that...some of my birthday money is going for a massage in an hour or so...Let us hear from you...send me your address and I'll add you to my book.. Bye for now, tell Robin hi for me and you keep in touch also. Becky 
Hey, I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold. That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later, 
Lynn, Have you heard anything from HR?  Is there any hope of me knowing something today? Thanks, 
Good b/c I didn't really feel like going anyway. Gabriel Monroy 02/05/2001 09:34 AM 
Whaaatt, you are not going, Why?? Ok, ok, don't worry, I won't feel bad if you don't go to Spanish. 
If you wanted to see me for lunch you should have just said so.  There's no need of going to the extreme of having a Spanish class...people are going to get suspicious.

So all those West Virginia stereotypes are true after all!!!  I think all my family has their own teeth.  Even my grandparents have their own teeth.  You know I always thought I had good family stories, but you definitely outrank me there. Have a good weekend. Robin Becky Pitre 02/02/2001 03:22 PM 
Something else weird about my sister and her daughter ( the ones who live in the sticks in W.Va.).  They both had all of their teeth pulled and then got dentures.  Janey is 46 and Missy is 24 years old.  Isn't that icky?  Missy told me that she liked her dentures because her teeth no longer hurt!  And my sister, I hate to admit this, says she likes them because she can take them out and clean them every few days!  Dang!  If they had used good, or even fair, hygiene then they could still have their real teeth.  So, brush, brush, brush. Now that you have picked yourself up off of the floor, stop laughing! Do you have a family story to top this one?  Hope not. Becky

I didn't think you could forget me!  I actually do have lunch plans already (SORRY), but maybe tomorrow or Friday we could go.  I have been in Houston since the first of the year.  Shannon (my husband) and I bought a new house in Katy.  It's a long drive, but we really like it there.  Got to go.... Talk to you later, JoAnne

Hey Robin, It's been a while since I have talked with or seen you.  In case you forgot, we worked together at LA Tech for Becky.  I am back permanently now as a tax analyst.  I am in the rotation program and am working in 3AC for what used to be EI for my first rotation.  I thought maybe we could get together sometime, go to lunch, and chat.

I hadn't thought about that scenerio yet.  Actually no one's asked that, but everyone's asked me when I'm going to Chicago.  There certainly aren't any secrets around here.  I never told anyone except Jeff, David, Rock and Binh that I was going to Chicago and yet everyone on the floor knows. They're putting out the food for today.  And they brought flowers for the tables!!  I'm so impressed.  The food's probably not very good is they're going to so much trouble to dress it up.  I think it might be tortilla soup.

Hey Becky, Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your knee doing by the way. I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong. And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's actually going to happen. You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the interview, much less to live up there. Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the questions and harrassment from everyone in risk. Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to hear from you if you have time.

What's he doing now?  Let me know when you can get away for a second and we'll go buy stamps.  I just surfing the web to see what I can find out about Chicago, so my schedule's pretty flexible. 
So, I take it your having a bad day.  Don't let him stress you out.  Is there anything I can do to help?  I'm headed downstairs to buy stamps later.   Let me know if you want anything from downstairs. No one's asked the questions I was expecting.  I think Anne was too drunk to remember asking.  I'm sure it'll come back up eventually. Are you still planning to go work out at lunch? Hope everything gets better. 
I told Gabriel about your hairdryer story.  He was appropriately disgusted.

As an update on Canada, I replied to Kathy's email and told her we weren't going to change 2000.  So she fired off an email to Jeff and made him mad.

Kathy, The 2000 DPR is closed.  Therefore no more changes can be made.  As I stated in my earlier email, either the 4.1 million adjustment was never actually made to the DPR or it is included in our number because the trading and origination p&l that I am reporting ties with what the DPR is reporting. Robin Kathy Reeves 01/10/2001 04:57 PM 
Robin, $4.1 M was to have been reduced from our Q1 trading income to break out the origination correctly.  It looks like this was never done in your report.  I thought it had been based on previous Emails.  I don't think the p&l in your report is correct as it is $4.1M too high.  This is what our trading income at Dec 31 should be.  Note:  the DPR was never adjusted because the LTD and YTD numbers do not exclude orgination income.  It also looks like the break out by trader is not quite right Kathy Robin Rodrigue 12/08/2000 10:58 AM 
Kathy, I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for December. Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances. Thanks, Robin Kathy Reeves 12/07/2000 06:46 PM 
Robin I would like to make sure before year end that the p&l being reporting for Canada ( trading profits only) equals what I think it is as per attached: Would you let me know what you are currently reporting for Canada. Thanks Kathy 
Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to

I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily report with all originated deals. He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Oohhh that is fine. Not a problem.  I love biiiiigggg breakfasts in NIICE restaurants. What is up with me in this group. They are definitely going to fire me. We were in a conference call with  the CEO of the Transportation company. His counselors, his tax lawyer, his investment bank, my boss, our counselor, our tax expert, and other very important people. Actually the conference was very very interesting. We (they, I just listened)basically talked about what to do with the unvested options of all the employees from the transport company, we talked about how the deal was going to change from a Stock purchase to a Merger. We talked about tax strategies, etc. It was very interesting.  HERE is the funny part. When we were discussing about all these things, I decided to stretch my leg  and guess what? ""I unplugged the phone line"".  Yeahh we missed some of the conversation.   My boss was like ""ohhh sh....."".  I thought it was funny, but obviously he did not think so. Oohhh you know what. I actually work Monday. My boss decided to veto our holiday Monday.   I am going to come in just to sort out all the due dilligence paperwork. It will be for a couple of hours only. YOu can take my car, and when the car is ready, you can probably pick me up and we'll go and pick it up. Gabriel

After work I'm going to find a notary so I can drop all this ticket stuff off.  And I have to get my oil changed, and if I have time I'm going to go get my brother's cd.  Oh and I have to pack...can't exactly put that one off any more.  But other than that I'm free this evening.  Do you have French? I'll call you later. 
Robin, Just wanted to let you know that I am going to miss you sooo much.Have fun and remember that there will be somebody in Houston dying to see you again. Take care.                             P.S. I am writing this from my apt. I just got back from your place.

What website did you find that cruise on? Gabriel Monroy 12/15/2000 09:31 AM 
It was hard to wake up after that dinner though.  Was it hard for you?  I feel like my whole body is swollen. My boss is sick again today.  Now, the outcome of that is really uncertain. He will either delay the whole due dilligence  process or maybe he will want to catch up and have us work even harder during the weekend. PS if you catch the cruise in New Orleans  after Christmas, do you think you'll make it to Veracruz for New Year's Eve. Gabriel 
Are you inviting me or just asking if the boat will make it on time?  If you invitingme I'd love to come but....I have to be back here the day after Christmas.  And Rock's off that week so there's no chance I could take off. I'll just have to stay here all by myself. If we go to lunch today, it'll have to be kind of quick.  I have my meeting with the analyst people at 11:30 and another meeting at 1:00. Bye. RR Gabriel Monroy 12/15/2000 09:31 AM

I dropped it off on my way this morning.   It's really no big deal to drive across the street on my way in. Gabriel Monroy 12/15/2000 09:32 AM

What  you talking about, Willis?  I thought you were in Chicago.  Last I heard it was a little bigger than most college campuses.  For sure bigger than Tech.  Well I'd write more but I have to go home for my nap.  I'm working a double shift so I'm leaving for a nap from about 10-2.  It makes the day pass much faster. Good night.

There are no stores to buy disposable cameras at here. This is like a little college campus. Once you're here, you're here. If I had a car, I'd drive into town and explore a bit.

Any last words for your car before I leave for my nap??  Don't worry I'm a ""safe driver.""  I'll sleep a little extra for you. 
Hey Becky, I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be running marathons by now. I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day. Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.

Read what Kathy wrote...What am I supposed to go tell Lavo he's wrong!!  I know she's the best risk person we have, but give me a break! 
Robin, As of the end of the 13th Clark had a Sumas Intramonth Position of 2 contracts. Regarding prompt physical and gas daily positions I don't think that the risk is being correctly reflected on the basis reports for Canada given the way our market trades (despite what Lavo says he wants). Kathy Robin Rodrigue 12/13/2000 07:00 AM 
Kathy, I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position. Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are not shown on this report. Brian, I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report containing December 12th basis positions. Thank you for your help. Robin Kathy Reeves 12/11/2000 05:34 PM 
Robin, I have reconciled the positions for Clark and Cowan.  Brian Gillis will do Disturnal, Lambie & McKay I believe that Clark & Cowan's positions were incorrect because of the following: 1)  Clark has positions at Sumas and Aeco/Stn2.  This is not reflected in the spreadsheet. 2)   Our basis positions for the prompt month in our Intramonth books are not being picked up any where.  Because our IM traders actually trade for this month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.  For example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.   Our IM traders trade prompt and well as intramonth because of the way our Aeco prices settle (ie:  during the month preceding, not during bidweek). Kathy Robin Rodrigue 12/11/2000 07:58 AM 
Brian/Kathy, I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points. Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a call. Thanks, Robin 
I'm low on clean clothes...I need to think if I have something to wear! Gabriel Monroy 12/13/2000 05:14 PM 
I remember when I was Looking for an apartment the locator always made a sale pitch on the fireplace. I always said I didn't care. This is the time  when you regret that, but anyways.   I first thought of just going to dinner, then I thought of maybe doing something else.  Now, I don't know anything.  Why do  you need to know if we do something else?   Do you worry you might go to bed a little late?   I do not want you to not get a good sleep just because of my birthday!! I'll keep thinking. I will be here and probably will not go to my french class. I need to finish something and would rather skip french that be working here after class. Gabriel Robin Rodrigue 12/13/2000 04:22 PM 
So are you thinking going to dinner or something else?  I need to know if you just can decide on a resturant or you can decide on what to do?  And if you want to do something other than eat you need to let me know. We could just curl up in front of the fireplace...oh wait neither of us have a fireplace.  Guess we'll have to think of something else.

I wasn't worried about you making it.  I was worrried about you making it back in time to give me my presents.  I work with a guy in our Chicago office.  He said it was pretty bad there.

I hate to disappoint you, but I made it alive. With no delays actually. I'm now staring out of a window watching it snow (that's the cold white stuff that you see on TV). They're expecting 6"" today ontop of what is already here. Everything is white...it looks like a postcard. Wish I had thought to bring a camera. The temperature when I landed was ZERO degrees.

I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch. If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday. Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up for whatever you want to do (within reason that is). Gotta go Canada's calling. 
I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's just no pleasing some people. I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH. Sorry that just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later. I'll give you a birthday call later. Robin Gabriel Monroy 12/13/2000 08:00 AM 
Don't you think that you are going to get away with just leaving a message. I am waiting for a more personal Happy Birthday call. Thanks anyways. What time did you get out of here yesterday? Gabriel

No.  That's not the gossip.  I probably have you more excited than you should be now.  It's not as interesting as you're probably thinking now.  I spent three hours dozing through defensive driving this afternoon.  It's horrible. They just keep saying the same things over and over. What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight?

No not the HR Spy.  I was in the middle of emailing you when Jennifer walked up to chit chat.  I didn't even think about it and left my email up the whole time she was here.

Just hoping I guess.   B/c mom already told me I wasn't getting anything from them, and I haven't picked out anything from the Grandmas, so even if I do get something it just means I'm going to have to find some corner of the closet to hide it in!!

Before you go mail me your house keys and tell me where you've hidden my Christmas presents.  Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas.  Hope you like Chicago.  Maybe you'll make it back by Easter. Ruston was good.  The game was awesome!!  It was so loud in there my ears were ringing when I left.  We lost but it was a much closer game than I expected.

So how is Ruston? Anything exciting going on? I'm heading to Chicogo this week. (St. Charles actually) I'm hoping that I will even make it.

Kathy, I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for December. Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances. Thanks, Robin Kathy Reeves 12/07/2000 06:46 PM 
Robin I would like to make sure before year end that the p&l being reporting for Canada ( trading profits only) equals what I think it is as per attached: Would you let me know what you are currently reporting for Canada. Thanks Kathy 
Thank goodness she's in when Congress will be a complete deadlock on every issue that is brought up!!  I really don't want  a government that can't even manage their money or make a decision in under a year deciding what doctor I can see.  It probably will reduce medical cost significantly.  People will just die before they can wade through the red tape to go to the doctor!!! Later, 
What CRAP!!!  They have no political voice and the machines are old, give me a break!  They didn't have a problem electing more blacks to their legislature, so I guess they weren't denied the right to vote.  That last quote by Jackson!!!  Oh my goodness, cry me a river. I can't believe they can even say all this crap with a straight face.  But then I'm sure I'm prejudice. Don't send me any more of this crap today.  I'm trying to enjoy my Friday. I'm headed to Ruston this weekend.  I'm going to see Tech and Tennessee.  I think I told you that already.  I'm going to visit Fake family while I'm there of course. Talk to ya later,

I think this is a good chance to get back on our Monday schedule.  Not that I don't want to have Spanish, but.....  If we didn't have Spanish you and I could go to lunch. Robin Gabriel Monroy 12/08/2000 08:31 AM 
That was the whole purpose of it, so maybe you'll change your mind and stay (he he). No honestly, have lots of fun. We'll talk later. I still need to think if we are going to have Spanish or not. Fridays and Spanish don't get along. Gabriel 
I definitely have time.  Give me a call when you want to go. Gabriel Monroy 12/07/2000 12:50 PM 
I am planning on going downstairs to grab a sandwich?   Do you have time? If you are doing something don't worry (honestly).  I did finish, but it was funny the way I finished it. Thanks for asking. You are so nice! 
Most of the time we meet these deadlines.  Several days the P&L hasn't been exported by 7:20 b/c I was waiting for the Management p&l changes, so that there wouldn't be such large changes between our preliminary and final p&l's.  If you rather I didn't wait let me know.  There have been a couple of days I've just forgotten, but that's not a regular occurance. Robin Jeffrey C Gossett 12/07/2000 10:48 AM

Yeah, I'm still here.  Still trying to tie out the basis.  I'll let you know.  I'm beginning to think I'll just tell them I haven't accomplished anything and be done with it.  There's no chance I'll get promoted anyway...my PRC rep doesn't even know I'm a girl.  In the email he sent Gossett he kept saying summarize ""his"" accomplishments, and ""his"" strengths, etc.  Goss thought it was hilarious. I'll let you know how everything's going, or I'll call you when I leave. 
What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start until 8:45 right? Bye, 
How do you come up with all this?  Did someone teach you how to write accomplishments?  This is awesome.  I hadn't thought about integrating my goals into my accomplishments.  And you consider me an overachiever!!

How did you start your accomplishments?  About the only thing I'm coming up with is ""Once upon a time I didn't work in risk and I had a life.""  There's probably a better way to do it though. 
Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one...I'm confused.  I didn't go last year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door. I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange. Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions. See you at lunch. Robin Gabriel Monroy 12/05/2000 07:51 AM

Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last crack b/c if I didn't you would have! 
I wish you would have sent me this BEFORE I ran into her today.  I had no idea if you'd talked to her or not so I wasn't going to say anything and make her made at you.  Anyway, I guess she's going to be good at keeping in quiet b/c I didn't know if she knew or not.  And as for the admitting in front of other people, I did tell you about this.  She asked me if you had left for Austin yet and I said no.  And then someone asked me what I was doing for the weekend and I said I was going Christmas shopping in San Marcos.  No mention of you or Austin.   Oh well, I guess we'll see how long the ""secret"" lasts. Was she mad at you? Talk to ya later,

You really want to leave badly, don't you?  I don't think I have anything you can do though.  I packed when I went home for my nap, so as soon as I can get out of here I'm ready to go.  So go home and watch a couple of movies and then I should be ready to go. 
What you talkin' bout Willis?  Actually I just got back about 3.  I went home and took a little nap!!  It was awesome.  But to answer your question yeah I'm ready to go.  I probably shouldn't leave, but I'm definitely ready!!! Gabriel Monroy 12/01/2000 03:41 PM

You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it should be a nice 20 hour day today. I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and give her a couple dozen pairs of each. Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs. Enjoy a doughnut for me.

My morning was great...no problems, everything nice and quiet the way I like it.  But this afternoon has been a little hectic.  Oh, well, it's making time go much faster.  Well except for the meeting with disable...that dragged on and on.  I'm so excited about getting out of here at a decent time.  If people will quit asking me questions so I can finish changing formulas on the basis report I'm going to get out of here by 3...that's my goal anyway.

A meeting with Disable.... can't wait to have that much fun? My day has been great. Well, more and more I realize that my stress is all my boss' fault.   Now that I have the associate with me I realize that he (my boss) does not explain things the way they should be explained.  The associate does not understand a lot of things because our boss hasn't come up with many of the assumptions needed for the project we are working on....... and I thought it was all my lack of knowledge.  Anyways, I think I just need to learn how to work with my new boss. I need to come up with my own assumptions. Hey, did those initials mean something? or were you just typing?  How is your day??  Are you excited you are going to get out of here at a descent time? GM (is that better?) 
I was trying to tell you that the blonde chick from Donna's group is down here.  The woman that's always whining about something.  She's driving me nuts.  That and the fact that I had a long meeting this morning with your other buddy, Chris Disable.  All we did was go in circles for about 45 minutes. How's your day going?

Sorry to hear you're being hazed today.  I'm glad to know he thinks you are worth something.  You can be pretty certain I won't be coming to join your new group when I rotate.  I think I'm going to rotate to the Controls group so I don't have to do anything. Yeah, I was way too excited to sleep last night.  Just thinking about all the fun I'd have this week.  Oh, here a highlight for your day.  I was excited today b/c I'd only have to work one shift this week.  I forgot Binh has today off too.  She won't be back until tomorrow, so I have another two shift day...YUCK!!!  And to top it off Irena just came by with the December calendar.  Binh has a week off and Rock has the last week of Dec through the first week of Jan off.  I'm sooo excited. Enough whining for now.  Are we having Spanish class today? Bye-bye.

I am glad everything is fine on your side.  I am sorry you did not get much sleep.  It is a mistery why sometimes you have those nights where you wake up looking at the clock. I am sure your problem was due to your  excitement to come back to work. You could not wait any longer. Well, I am definitely not glad... the hazing started again, and I think it doubled.  If we look at it in an optimistic way, having me do these exercises that are really hard mean his expectations have not been lowered.  He still thinks I am worth something. Talk to you later.

Kathy/Brian, As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian VAR to be so high.  One possible cause that we would like your help investigating is the Curve Codes that are being loaded in the position files that are manually loaded into the system each night.  It is my understanding that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are spelled correctly in all position files. Please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks, 
Will, Please send me the official book names so that I can set this up in the bench.  If you have a copy of the book request that should have all the information I need.  Also, please let me know what trader is responsible for this position. Thanks,

Jeff, I took care of the Executive Viewer.  I talked to Frank and apparently Lavorato wants to see the Canadian breakout next week.  I already have everything set up to do the positions, but we need to work on Canada to get the P&L.  Intra-Canada has a breakout but it's only in Canadian dollars.  I left a message for Kathy to call me.  Just wanted to give you a heads up. Talk to you Monday. Robin Jeffrey C Gossett 11/18/2000 12:40 PM

Don't worry there's no rush.  Take your time and exhaust all your other options...don't worry it doesn't hurt my feelings that you are trying desparately to get out of spending the holidays with me.  Just kidding. Have a good weekend. 
Me polite??  I think you have me confused with someone else.  You  are definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and catch a movie, so you are welcome to come. What'cha doing for lunch? Robin Gabriel Monroy 11/17/2000 11:26 AM 
Robin, I thought you were just being polite and you felt bad because it was going to be a lonely Thanksgiving for me.  So, you were serious about it?   I really appreciate that you still keep me in mind, and I apologize for not having told you anything. I am sure you probably need to know to plan ahead. Ok, here is the plan. Let me make a few phone calls b/c  my best friend  from Cd. Juarez (border with El Paso, TX) said he  was going to Austin for that weekend  but nothing is for sure. Also, Ramiro was planning a trip, but I don't feel that bad If I decline b/c you know he loves finding foreigners to travel with. He actually already found somebody. Honestly, I did think about it, and I was a little worried that maybe you want to spend quality time with family and friends and I will be a perfect

Time spent actually typing, procrastinating, or staring blankly into space?? I spent the most of the morning Wed. on evaluations.  Of course I had five to do and plenty of little tasks thrown in the middle.  So it probably took me about 20 minutes per evaluation.  Some I had to think about a little harder than others.  It all depends on how many comments you write.  Mine took me the longest and I'm still not happy with it. Have fun bowling.  I'd love to see your shirt!! Robin Gabriel Monroy 11/17/2000 10:19 AM 
I promise I won't bug you again.  I just need to plan ahead. How long did it take you to finish PEP (avg. time spent  per person)? 
Sounds like you have a wild night planned.  I don't think I'm up to that kind of partying tonight.  I've actually finished the evaluations, but I haven't submitted them yet.  I'll do that today.  Thanks for the warning though. How late were you here last night?  How did everything turn out with your boss yesterday? Later, Robin Gabriel Monroy 11/17/2000 09:37 AM 
Did you finish all your evaluations? I haven't .  I called  PEP and they are going to shut the system down at midnight tonight.  Just wanted to let you know in case you are planning on having an awesome friday afternoon like I am.  I am going to bring popcorn and a good CD.

Well, it's that time again - Mike Norris will again be representing each of you during this joyous time. To make sure we have up-to-date information, would you please email your current company, department, supervisor and supervisor's phone number. Please let me have this information as quickly as possible. Thanks. Carol 
Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........ I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the ""fun run"" on Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories. As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here. I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in seasoning. I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might see and for fear he'd think I was interested. Gotta go to a meeting. Robin Mike Pitre <pitre@ev1.net> on 11/13/2000 08:38:10 AM 
Wow, what a trip.  Wish I could have been there to be with all those old people.  I do have specific questions about Australia though. How is the food?  Weird, good or just not worth eating?  What do they eat? What did you eat? See any good looking guys? Did you make them speak just to hear the accent?  Did they make you speak just to hear your accent? Going back? Megan enjoyed your email  message.  Needless to say so did I. Ann and I ran a 25 K (15.5 miles) yesterday morning.  Got a T-shirt and a banana for the run.  Neat, huh?  I was nine minutes slower this year than last year but it doesn't bother me.  I had fun but at about mile 13 I was definitely ready to cross the finish line.  I just had a couple more miles. My shorts chaffed the inside of my inner thighs and that was/is painful. Is that too much information?  I can walk this morning but my legs are fatigued.  I couldn't run from the front door to pick the newspaper off of the front lawn this morning.  Pitiful.  Too bad you can't see and hear me moan.  I'll just write it a couple of times.  Moan, moan.  There, that's better. Plans for Turkey Day?  Want to run a 5 K with Ann and I?  It'll be fun. Let me know.  You know, I think Ann is going to Michigan, so it'll just be me.  Maybe I'll just stay home and stuff my face. Megan is very weak.  I sure do love that kid. Well, don't work too hard. See ya, Becky

Thought ya'll would like this.... 
Couldn't resist sending this!!!!!!!!!!! Sandy Hopefully no food list will be unhappy with this A CHANGE IN PLANS Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've made a few small changes: Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect. The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china or crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone will get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas. Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is a turkey. We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while you wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 AM upon discovering that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them. They are lying. We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separate room. Next door. Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at our dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony. I stress ""private"" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on my progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat. Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You will still have a choice: take it or leave it. Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably won't come next year either. I am thankful.

Hey Becky, What's going on?  Things are completely crazy as usual around here.  I need another vacation!  I never told you about my trip did I?  I've told everyone else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  It was so much fun.  The olympics were so awesome.  I got to see the US women's basketball team play Australia for the gold medal.  The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we won.  And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.  The whole first week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  And the second week I spent touring all the beaches that I could find.  Oh, here's a funny story for you.  Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, muscular sufers, right?  So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters one day.  These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 80-100 people.  As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people on the cruise.  Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII veterans reunion!!!  I was on a boat full of grandpa's.  Actually it was pretty funny.  This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the war.  Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war. He said, ""Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very well so I left.""  He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece where he joined the Greek reserve forces.  Because he fought with Greece in the war he's now a Greek citizen.  Then after the war he and some friends bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.  When they ran out of money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then they'd start again.  I hope one day I have stories even half that interesting!!  But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out with old people!! How's everything going at your house?  What's up with this election?  That's all anyone's talking about around here. Talk to ya later,

I paid about $94 Austalian which is around $50.  It was a pretty big, and definitely awkward (that word doesn't look right) that's why it flew home on it's own.  Besides I already had my luggage allotment.  My box wasn't nearly as heavy as yours is.  What kind of tree did you buy???  What is it an iron statue of a tree? Are you leaving tomorrow?  I know I've asked you this before but I can't remember.  If you don't have any plans let's go to lunch. Robin Gabriel Monroy 11/08/2000 09:34 AM 
Thanks,  I'll send this to Ibrahim and he will then send that to the guy in EBS.  I have a few  questions for you.  How much did you pay for the box that was sent to you from Australia?  Why did you not take it with you? Ok, this is the story. My mom asked me if I could buy a Christmas tree,and of course, being a super duper nice son as I am, I was stupid enough to buy it. Well the box is about 63 lbs. and 57 x 14 inches . I called Continental and they said they would accept it.  Well, I am not sure about the whole thing. First, it is so big that it doesn't even fit in my car. I had to take it home with the trunk open. I'll see how I can figure this out, but I just wanted to ask you about the box from Australia. Anyways, I hope I can see you before I leave for Mexico. I probably just drop by and say bye. Of course I have not packed and still have to buy a few things. Have a nice day. I'll let you know about the whole EBS thing. Gabriel 
Monica, I never received your basis positions for Lavorato.

Sorry to hear about your airport travels.  Has Alejandra found a place to live yet?  When is she starting on the east desk...they need help!!  They screwed their position up again today. My weekend was really good.  Of course it could have been better without the rain.  Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon and then went out to eat and to a movie.  Then Sunday we went to visit some friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.  So we spent most of Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.  The dad is hilarious.  He's the type that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.  He was talking about the baby monitors they got.  He said he was going to put a message on it that said, ""Hi, Brianna.  This is your parents.  We aren't 
Rest of Saturday was good I went out with some friends to this place I really like. However, Sunday was  not so good. I went to IAH (airport) twice. So, that was almost like going to Austin, plus on the way back rain was very very bad (The 10:30 pm. rain).  For the second time, Alejandra's plane was delayed, but this time it was more than 5 hours delayed. She got stuck in Dallas and of course I knew once I was already at IAH.  How about you? Hey, My right shoulder is a little sore (Golf). Is your's sore? or am I just a little rusty. Gabriel 
Thanks.  How was the rest of your weekend? 
Yeah, but you know I can't resist an opportunity to make a sarcastic remark. Gabriel Monroy 11/03/2000 02:14 PM 
See now I think you should stay with risk. Yeahh.I think you are better off there. he he he. You know this means that if you go to EBS our stock can actually go down. No, what it really means is that I might have to help the new person if you are really busy. Personally I do not like the idea. Ok, I'll ask Ibrahim about this friend of his. As for golf practice, we'll see if the weather turns out to be ok. I'll send you an email once I know this guy's name, ok? I was asking what you thought about  the whole EBS thing, not about my nervousness. Gabriel 
What do I think about what...the fact that you're now the one that's a little stressed?  I think that's kind of funny!!  Just kidding.  I have a friend coming in town this weekend, but she's not coming until sometime Sat. afternoon probably around 3-4ish.  So if you want to go to the driving range around noonish on Sat. we could do that.  Although I think it's supposed to rain all weekend so we might just end up back at the movies. As for the rotation, I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the Morton's dinner.   I guess I'd be as well off starting with him as to call Ibrahim's friend, since I don't know Ibrahim or his friend.  Well actually, I might know Ibrahim's friend.  Ask Ibrahim his friend's name and if I don't know him I'll call Brian on Monday and see exactly what it is that they do. Thanks for the help with this. Talk to ya later, Robin Gabriel Monroy 11/03/2000 12:59 PM 
Well, We can go different routes. Do you know Brian Hoskins?  If not, I know him well. Well, he works in that group. He can tell us what it is about. The last time I talked to him, he did mention something about customers (big customers); but honestly I am not sure exactly what it is. Then what we can do is ask Ibrahim the name of his friend. We'll ask Brian if he knows him ( Brian, by the way, loves to help people. but only good people : ( and we can go from there. If not, we can just go trhough Ibrahim. Once that is done, We'll figure what to tell Gossett (ouchhhh) . Uppsss, I do not want any oart during this stage. He will probably kill me if he knows I told you about this group. Ibrahim is leaving next week. He had told me that he was going to stay about 3 more weeks, but his new group wants him. Uppsss  I feel I have SOOOOO Much to learn. I really feel behind. There will be a lot of reading this weekend but of course I might take a break and go to the drive range if you want to go. You never responded me. Ok, ok, maybe you do not want to go. I'll go on my own and hit the ball with my tennis raquet. Anyways. who said there was no stress level here. I am getting kind of nervous because it is a little complicated.  Tell me what you think. Gabriel 
So what you're telling me is that you're intentionally trying to bait me. Apparently you haven't figured out yet that it can be hazardous to your health to make me mad!!  And I know you well enough to know that my last statement will only serve as a challenge to you.  You're going to spend the rest of the day trying to irritate me.  Don't deny it.  I know you too well. So where are we going to watch the game?  If I understood soccer a little better I'd be more involved in the trash-talking.  But I'll just leave it at this...the US could kick Mexico's butt at anything!!  Mexican men can't even knock down an American girl even when they are given 13 whole seconds to try!!  How could you possibly expect a group of these weaklings to beat a group of top quality American athletes. Bye. PS Have fun in all those meetings.  Pretty soon you'll be going to more than Gossett. Gabriel Monroy 02/28/2001 11:55 AM 
Oohhh that one, it was cancelled.  I am becoming more bureaucratic now, so I had a meeting at 10:00 with Treasury, then I was supposed to have this one at 1:00 and there is another one with Corporate Finance at 2:30.  To tell you the truth, the one at 10:00 I was clueless and then I found out I was the one that was supposed to kind of give all the information. (information I of course did not know). It was a good learning experience because we called somebody else that I told them had the information. Thanks for asking.  I am getting ready and pumped up because I think today at 6:30 we are going to kick some gringo butt.  What do you think?  You need to get upset, because otherwise this is not going to be fun. Gabriel 
Yeah that very interesting.  What exactly is the origination team doing now that they've already signed the deal with blockbuster?  Are they trying to sign up customers or providers or what?

I didn't want this just popping up on your screen. So far it's just getting worse!!!  I've already been up there three times today and of course each extra trip lowers the P&L.

Chris, Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need any more information. Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295 contracts over the same period.

Dawn, Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that. Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't know. Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not. Hope you enjoyed your trip.

Have a good evening. 
Okay, here's a trivia question for you.   There are two siblings.  One's an engineer and one's an accountant.  One works for a natural gas company and the other works for an accounting firm.  Which one works for the accounting firm? Do you see the absurdity of our lives???  Level III, huh?  I don't know anyone over level II.  Well, except Mr. Kirkpatrick's friend that's a partner in New Orleans. I dreamed the other night that I was outside the Swimming venue in Australia and the American coach heard me talking and realized I was an American.  He told me I had to swim an event b/c all the swimmers were either sick or injured.  I never did get to swim, though.  The alarm went off before I even found out what event I was swimming.  I hope it's not butterfly...I wouldn't be very competitive if I had to swim butterfly.  Not that I'd even be competitive if I was swimming freestyle at the olympics, unless it was the special olympics...then I might stand a chance! Congrats on the job.

I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right there's no hope for keeping me in line!  I think I'll just retire early and stay over there.  I would make a very good beach bum.  Of course with my complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have the soft and squishy part down).   I went shopping and spent way too much money this weekend buying things for my trip.  I'm having to buy clothes.   I don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes. I'm used to only two seasons, summer and suedo-winter.  It'll be spring over there and I've been checking the temperature.  It's been between the mid 40's and the low 70's.  I'm going to have to pack everything I own. I'm really sorry to hear about Megan's prognosis.  I know you hear this all the time but seriously, if there's anything at all I can do let me know. And I want you to know you guys are always in my prayers. We should go to lunch sometime now that I'm working daylight hours. Talk to ya later, 
Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away.   They said we got rain here, but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle.  Just enough to make my car look like I went driving through mud puddles. What kind of job did Aruthur offer?  Once again let me point out that I enjoy the fact that this is on your company email. I'm spending my time these days checking the official Olympics website and dreaming.  I'm trying to get fired so I can just stay in Australia.  I don't think it's working though b/c I just keep getting more jobs.  I have two right now. Be nice and I might at least think about you while I'm in Australia. Talk to ya later,

I'm hoping they have good movies on the flight!  But I'm also bringing a good book, and I'll probably bring a pair of headphones...even if I don't plug them into anything.

Gabriel, I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day. However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris. Thanks, Robin PS The Bench by trader tied out for the 23rd.  I'll be in a little early tomorrow to tie it out for the 24th.  Bye. 
Robin, I spoke with Kathy regarding the problem we are having with origination. Her explanation is as follows: This is an fx issue. Because origination is denominated in a currency (USD) which is different than our functional currency (CAD), origination expense will be comprised of not only origination but also currency gains and losses on origination. Everyday orig. is retranslated in C$ using the current rate and any fx gains or losses relating to that is added to origination. Therefore, the total origination as per the ""origination"" tab will NOT equal the origination as per the ""report"" tab. Robin should add in the translation gains/losses to get it to reconcile. I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable. I know you're used to the two numbers reconciling but since we were asked to denominate our origination in US dollars (about 2 months ago) these two numbers will never again be the same. Please call if you have any questions, Nicole

This book is officalized by Jenny Latham and the position is not reported on the benchmark.  Therefore, I don't believe it should be included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Also please ensure that this book is not included in the AGG-GAS portfolio. Thanks, 
Kathy, Here is the detail and position for IM Canada yesterday.  It seems that the price txt file didn't get run last night (our fault).   I'll make sure that gets done tonight. Let me know if you need anything else. 
Yeah,my family's pretty entertaining!!  I went home last weekend for my mom's birthday.  We had all gone somewhere and when we were about to turn the corner on our street we were all praying and holding our breath hoping my grandmother wasn't at our house!!  She's been driving my mother crazy (it's my dad's mom by the way).  She's now determined that there's something terribly wrong with her.  She has a doctor's appt this week and says she's going to convince the dr to send her to the diagnostic center of houston.  My dad informed me that she told him she'd just fly here...so I'm guessing she actually thinks I'm going to take off work for a week to shuttle her back and forth to the dr.   She's wrong of course! Well enough rambling for now.  If I get any good family emails I'll let you know!

I thought you'd appreciate the humor in these.  Actually the first one's kind of scary!!  Just in case you think I made this stuff up the web site's at the bottom. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is actively proposing that animal carcasses with cancers, tumors or open sores be regarded merely as unaesthetic but safe for human consumption as long as the offending part is cut away. The proposal is part of a general loosening of slaughterhouse inspection standards, whose public comment period ends Aug. 29. One critic already weighed in, saying she did not want to ""eat pus from a chicken that has pneumonia,"" but also included as benign by the proposal are glandular swellings, infectious arthritis and diseases caused by intestinal worms.

Thanks for making my day by sucking me back into a world with mental images of someone standing there scratching!! 
A Charlotte, NC man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were lost ""in a series of small fires"". The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated, nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be considered to be an ""unacceptable fire,"" and was obligated to pay the claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he had lost in the ""fires"". And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and

No I promise I didn't....your post-id crashed my system.  I had your book and the power book and the Nymex book all coming in at the same time and the system just stopped.  We're going again though, so I should have your position in a few minutes. 
I would like to attend the Cornell Brown Bag. Thanks,

It sounds pretty good, but I'd rather talk to mom and see if there's something specific he wants before we get that.  B/c for all his talk about using the computer he usually ends up using his books instead. I'll call mom either tonight or in the morning.  I'll let you know what I find out. 
Hey, I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants. Authur Anderson, huh??  You do know they are slave drivers, right??  Of course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job!!  I find it pretty funny that you wrote that to my from your work email. Well it's about time I got started working today. 
Yeah, like this week.  And no I have no ideas...not even bad ones.  And I can't seem to find my catalog to order mom something.  I requested a new one but I don't know if we'll get it in time.  You need to just go wander around a home depot and find Dad some useless gadget. Later, 
Brian, Well, we're a lot closer, but we're not exact.  I'm attaching a copy of what I pulled when I loaded the new files. Thanks for your help, 
Brian, Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our directory.  I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position. Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve this variance. Thanks, Robin 
Let me know how we did. 
Brian, Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all unique what you had was fine. If you have any more questions just give me a call. Thanks, 
Sorry it took so long. 
Kathy, Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers. Thanks, Robin

I think we should park at Samy's again.  What have you been up to today? I've been ""training"" Bilal.  It's really hard to be patient answering questions when you are trying to get something done quickly.  He asked me who knew the reports besides me.

Ramesh, Could you please resend me the email with all your groups pager numbers. Thanks,

Mac&Cheese huh?  Eating a light lunch?  When I was at Tech I complained about the food one day (well actually I complained a lot, but one day I made an official complaint).  Anyway I was telling the guy over the food service that the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge $6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an entree)  and lose money you must be the worst businessman in the history of the world.  I don't think he appreiciated me sharing my opinion with him. 
Kathy, I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more guidelines for the text files. 1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.) 2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line. 3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY. 4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.  If there is no position please use a zero. 5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.  No commas, no dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.  Again if there is no position please use a zero. The guidelines apply to all text files that must be loaded into GRMS.  If you have any question, please give me a call. Thanks, 
Kathy, Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel file that Brian saved in the directory. Thanks, Robin 
Please format the text files to be processed through GRMS in the following manner. 1) Sort by book id, then by master deal id, then by reference date. 2) The dates must be in the following format.  4-Mar-97 3) The book names must be the same every day. 4) If the cell should contain a number please put a zero if there is no value.  GRMS will not recognize a N/A in a field that is supposed to contain a number. 5) Please name the files in a manner consistent with those below. If you have any questions feel free to give me a call. Thanks, Robin 
Let me know how it looks.  Is Kathy going to send text files tonight? Thanks, 
That sounds fine to me.  If I'm reading it correctly, we are actually changing the other Gas Daily books to have the same logic as the Gas Daily Options book currently has.  If my understanding isn't correct please let me know.  But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow. Thanks, Robin Enron North America Corp.

Chris, The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today. However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it. Thanks, Robin 
The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today. When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L. If you have any questions feel free to give me a call. Thanks,

I'm working hard as usual.   I saw you call...don't start screaming yet...I had an IT guy and several other people at my desk at the time.   I saw Me, Myself, and Irene too.  It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the ""sons"" got on my nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!! Well I better get busy.  Bye. We still need to go to lunch sometime. 
I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below. BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts) GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9 GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3 GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5) If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic please let me know. Thanks, Robin 
Here you go! 
David, Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark. 1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the positions can be pulled into the benchmark. 2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS. 3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This process can take up to 45 minutes to complete. 4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS. 4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly. 5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more books that are officialized, the longer the query takes. 6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process must be started over. 7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS position. 8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me. 9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently in the bench. 10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen it. If you have any more questions let me know. Robin

Virendra, Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that are fixed price gas daily deals. Thanks, Robin

Hey Guys, We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call. I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you show a position of long 241 contracts.

Tomorrow I'm going to be here really early in the morning, so I'll probably be tired tomorrow night.  But I could go to the concert if you can get tickets.  B/c Thursday I'll have to pack and get some sleep for my flying trip to Chicago Friday. Bye,

Kathy, As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark. Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a copy of what you reported. As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information. Thanks, Robin 713-345-7478

I've dragged you to two country concerts, so you can pick this one.  Either is fine with me.  I promise.  Mom and I did have a good weekend.  We were laughing last night b/c we really didn't do anything.  We just sat around and talked and watched movies all weekend.  She said to tell you she's sorry she ruined your weekend.  I told her you didn't mind that she was here. What'd you end up doing last night? Talk to ya later,

1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L. 2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to properly represent originations on the NGP&L. 3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark. 4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so that the information                need only be queried once.  This was accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file. 5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total and reflects the Lavorato time buckets. 6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report to the Benchmark. 7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report. I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would like to see them also please let me know. Thanks,

Have you thought of a gift I could give to my friends in Australia yet?  You really need to get on that.  I'm going shopping this weekend.  I have to buy a mother's day gift for my mom (I know a little late, but I haven't seen her yet) and a birthday gift for my younger brother (can't call him little anymore, he's as big as me) and I think I'm going to go ahead and get a father's day gift for my dad. Well, have fun.  Talk to ya later. RR Becky Pitre 06/07/2000 03:40 PM

I told you I had a rough day!!!  I was DYING by the last game.   I've never felt that out of shape.   So what are you still doing here? Becky Pitre 06/05/2000 06:45 PM 
OK, you get sympathy with a raspberry.  That's pretty intense to slide!  I don't even sprint.  Wow.  B Robin Rodrigue 06/05/2000 05:30 PM 
You must be having a bad day!!  But you know it's not my fault...and there's nothing soft about softball!!  And I slid yesterday, twice, so I have a little bit of a rasberry on my calf.  Did that get me any sympathy?? Probably not!  I hope you finish close soon. Becky Pitre 06/05/2000 05:25 PM 
No.  Not softball.  SOFT is the key word.  B. Hard ass, aren't I? Robin Rodrigue 06/05/2000 05:24 PM 
I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that's this sore.  We should be sore though.  We played 5 games.  And I played every second of every game.  Now don't you feel sorry for me?!

What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it felt like. Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always asking and driving you crazy. Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi. RR Becky Pitre 06/05/2000 10:03 AM 
Hey, the wedding girl is back in the office today.  She says she needs a couple more days off!  After a week of partying how could you need more time off?! Some one butchered Carla's hair.  Poor thing.  I think I'd go to another hair dresser. Megan's getting an MRI this morning. I need another day off because I worked so much Thursday, Friday and Sunday! And food is not payment! See ya.  It's a zoo here. B 
Here are your positions.  I checked the conversion factors in our system.  I had the factors that you sent me, so I don't know why we are pulling different factors. Let me know how the position looks tonight. Thanks,

These are revised schedules for Jan, Mar, &  Apr 2000 and the estimate (scheduled) volumes for May. The prices were revised to capture Texas General storage revenue (fuel retention) in Jan, Mar, & Apr.  The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy price for the storage book. The April also has volume true-ups due to actual metered volumes. (Schedule 6).  Another adjustment was made in April to true up the cumulative facility balance, (4,295 mmbtu). Thanks, Kenny 
It's official.  I'm going to start up there March 12th.  As for a place to live, I'll probably make a quick trip up there sometime next week to look at apartments. Robin 
I'm going. Thanks, 
Ivonne, Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I turn it in to? Thanks, Robin Enron North America Corp.

Kathy, I discussed the $35K variance with Brian yesterday, and the adjustment will be made on the last day of March.  That will ensure that we tie to your number for the rest of the month.  Then we'll do a top level adjustment on the last day P&L to clear the variance from last month.  I've talked with Brad Jones (the person preparing the NGP&L) and Brian Gillis is supposed to remind him at the end of the month. I start my new job in Chicago next week.

I sent Charlene an email this morning and surprise, surprise I haven't heard 
I spoke with Monica about this issue yesterday. Robin Chris Abel 02/22/2001 12:20 PM 
The gas group stopped publishing it to the website, but I am not sure if they use the info for other purposes.  Maybe Robin or David can respond to that issue. Chris 
Chris, most of the remaining people on the distribution list are EES management.  Does Corp no longer require the Basis position report to be prepared daily?  If so, we will no longer send it. Thanks, MYH Chris Abel@ECT 02/16/2001 10:26 AM 
You can take Michael Benien and myself off of the list, as we no longer use this report.   Additionally, you should remove Rahmaan Mwongozi and Gabriel Monroy as they no longer work in the gas group.  You might want to check with the others to see if the report needs to continue going to them also. Thanks, Chris MONICA HWANG@EES 02/14/2001 04:51 PM 
Please find the attached EES Basis Position Report. Thanks, Monica 
Did you see?  She completely blew me off.  I submitted a more specific 
Thanks for the explanation b/c I was completely clueless.  They are definitely censoring.   She hasn't answered anything other than the program requirements, etc.  What a waste of time.  But I guarantee you they'll bring this up as something great they've done to improve communication. 
Are you watching this eSpeak?  Either no one is asking interesting questions or they are censoring them.  I asked about why we have arbitrarily assigned 
My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon. That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake. You'll be invited too of course. I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning? Talk to ya later 
Hey Richard, I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you. I'll let you know if anything changes. Robin 
Kathy, I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance. Robin Kathy Reeves 03/06/2001 06:48 PM

I still haven't caught her.  Supposedly her meetings end at 5, so if I don't get her then I'm leaving.  Have fun at dinner and don't stay too long when you come back. 
I'm now trained to avoid harrassment.   Actually it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be...not that it was exactly interesting, but it could have been much worse.  I was going to leave, but I just found out that Laura's in Houston.  Not only is she in Houston, she's in a conference room on this floor.  I keep peeking in the window to see if she's still in there.  I'm just hanging around now hoping to get a chance to talk to her. 
When David told me I had to go, I told him I already knew how to avoid harrassment...just stay away from he and Jeff.  But I guess since I have nothing else to do I might as well go. Gabriel Monroy 02/20/2001 11:14 AM 
Muahaaaaaaa, that is me laughing. I really laughed when i received this email.  No, nobody harasses me, so I am not going. I think somebody is harassing you. I will be here. Have fun, and save me some of that cake. Gabriel 
Hey do you have to go to the harrassment avoidance seminar?  We got an email saying we were required to attend one of the sessions.  So that's what I'm doing this afternoon.   Yippee! 
About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now. And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some. I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that you blew him off. R Gabriel Monroy 02/20/2001 10:31 AM 
Jaime just sent me an email apologizing because he could not find me. He said that he asked everybody (friends you have not met). A couple of Nicaraguans, and  some other colombians.  Before Jaime, Hector and I moved out of Austin, I used to hang out with all these people. Harry does not particularly like them, but Ramiro was also part of this group.  Anyways, Jaime kept asking for Harry's phone number and nobody knew his phone number, so he thinks he stood me up. Hmmm, what should I say. Should I say I was waiting for his call all weekend long, or just tell him the truth? Yeahh I want to try your King cake.  I am not hungry at all though. OUr assistants kept getting creative every day and our breakfast was getting better and better. I am not sure what happened last time they ordered. They must have been stoned. We had Peperoni calzone for BREAKFAST!!!!!!!. The worst part is that I ate one. My stomach is a little upset.  Too much junk food in less than 24 hours. 
I think harassing me is a very popular pass time around here. Gabriel Monroy 02/20/2001 10:08 AM 
hey, not much here.  None of my bosses are here, however, Tim left me some work to do and I am having a hard time comparing my results to what the analysts say they should be.  Tim would be disappointed if this is not finished by tomorrow. At least that is what I think, so I am keeping myself busy.  I have time to check my e-mail though, so keep writing.   For example, you can lie to me about how beautiful Lake Charles is, oopsss.  I think Jeff enjoys harassing you very very much. Anyways, if you find something interesting to tell me, let me know. 
Yeah, I already told Jeff I was going to have to log on and ask Charlene what's wrong with the Analyst HR.  I can't wait.  But it's like I told him, if you ask her a questions she doesn't want to answer (which is almost any legitimate question) she just pretends you asked something else and answers that. I have King cake down here if you want some.  It's pretty good, but I've had better.   Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night.  I told her about our cooking experience.  Don't worry I told her it was good. Do you have lunch plans? 
What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today. Hope you're having a good day.

Hey, Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke. Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent him an email with the flight information. Talk to ya later, Robin

Nancy, I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen. BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently used region code.) Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for your help, Robin 
Nancy, The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.

I've decided that I'm going to quit worrying about them.  I finally heard from the VP yesterday.  Her son has been in the hospital, so she's been out of the office ever since I went up there.  So basically we've made no progress.  She's back now, though, so I'm hoping I'll know something soon. If I do end up going which is very likely I'm going to leave pretty soon. That's  the main reason I'm going home this weekend.  I'll let you know when I hear something. RR 
I'd like to be there around 7 if that's when it starts.  But we probably don't need to leave here until 6:30-6:45ish.  Just call me before you go to class and let me know when you'll get out and I'll meet you downstairs. I'm probably going to leave around 3:30 if things stay this calm. Bye 
There's no need to lie.  If you don't have anything interesting to tell me just admit it.  I'm bored not dillusional. Becky Pitre 02/14/2001 02:48 PM

That does not qualify as something interesting.  You need to try harder.

I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today? So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, ""Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further.""  Funny, I didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been nice to chew someone out. Talk to ya later,

Hey girl, I'm really in about the same position I was in on Monday.  I've talked to the people in the office and they promise me they are still interested in having me up there.  But HR seems to be impeding the process at this point.  I'm just waiting for them to get back to me.  And the VP's son had surgery this week and apparently it was much more serious than they expected, so she's been unavailable all week.  She's supposed to be back in the office on Monday so hopefully she'll shake things up a little.  I definitely won't leave without saying goodbye.

Tom, It looks like everything ran perfectly.  I have attached a copy of the positions that were loaded into the system.  Let me know if you see any problems, but they seem to be in line with what you expected. Let me know if you have any questions. Robin 
Good morning, Here is last night's benchmark report which includes our latest intramonth deals.  I also made the changes you suggested.  You should see MTM of around (79,000) and a volumetric position of approximately (600,000) for the intramonth deals. Please test the file at your first convenience. Thanks, Tom

Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would have fun if you come.  Becky always tells stories about either her family or her husbands.

I heard from the admin in  Chicago.  She said Laura (the VP) is going to call the HR people and then call me sometime later today.  Maybe we'll actually make some progress today.  I'll let you know if I hear something. Now get back to work!! 
Frank, I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once Feb rolles to intramonth the ""From date"" on the calc is changed from the Jan 1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR calc not the post ids. Let me know if this doesn't answer your question. Robin Enron North America Corp. 
What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her ""I've been here longer, so you can work Valentines night.""  The only thing that makes me feel bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a while. Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute coffee break with Alejandra and I haven't done anything constructive since I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though. Te quiero.

Yes I did get an apartment.  They are still doing some renovations, so I'll probably be in a hotel for a few days.  The owner said he would try to have it by the 12th, but you know how that goes.  I should be able to move in no later than the 16th though so that's not too bad.  If you could recommend a hotel I'd appreciate it. Thanks, Robin

That was funny...in fact it was the funniest thing I've heard all morning. I'd rather go to lunch. Thanks anyway though. Becky Pitre 02/06/2001 10:51 AM 
At 11:15 wanna go to a 15 minute ab class and then go for a three mile run? No, I'm not trying to kill you.  B 
I have nothing to do either but I'm just surfing the web.  I'm not as dedicated as you are. Gabriel Monroy 02/06/2001 10:41 AM 
At that rate you will pay to get out of Houston right?     No worries, there is still another game on the 20th and the Season begins Feb 27th (this one is for points. The other two are Pre-season but still very competitive because they are organized by the league).  By the 27th, maybe you will already have finished GMAT. So, I guess I should not even worry about having told Purvi right?    Well, if you finish the benchmark early, you know where to go, but don't worry. I won't be expecting you. Let me know what you hear from Laura (if that is how you spell her name).  I will talk to the MD after lunch I guess. I'll let you know what the outcome was. There is absolutely nothing to do. I am educating myself by reading some things about Acquisitions. Gabriel 
Hey, It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all. Enough whining for now. Talk to ya later, 
You are one sick puppy!!  I hear your boss revoked your eating privileges. 
Yeah, give me a call.  I'm headed home to do GMAT homework. Gabriel Monroy 02/05/2001 05:18 PM 
Yes, Do you want me to call you after French so you can tell me all about it? 
Yeah, I heard.  It took an act of Congress and I'm not exactly thrilled. 
I already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the same as for Houston.  Which means that the prices should be comparable, so I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should have the ""offer"" in a couple of hours.  It's a big mess.  I'll have to tell you that story later.  My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the analyst HR moron.  If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in the mood for it!! I'll let you know what I find out.

Well,  you are in a good position because you could sell your car but you don't necessarily have to.  In Enron terms this would be called a put option and we charge for it, so make sure you pay me premium.    The actual paperwork takes no time. It could be done in a day. Now, if your question was the time that you can actually find a potential buyer....well, that really depends on how much you want for it.  Have you decided on a  ""floor"".  In other words, decide how much is the minimum you would accept for your car. Another thing I would do is check the prices in Chicago.  Prices for cars vary a little  depending on the city. So see if comparable cars in Chicago are selling for less, that way, it might be a good opportunity to try to sell it here.  SInce you don't have to sell it, I would check the market very very well.  You don't need the money, and you don't need to sell it. You have the power. If you decide to advertise it,  don't mention anything about Chicago. I'll help you with research later. Gabriel 
Monica, Please remove me from your distribution list.  I have moved to another job. Thanks,
