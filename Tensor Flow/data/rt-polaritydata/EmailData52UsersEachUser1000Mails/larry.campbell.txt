The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California. The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha. Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7. A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and 
Transwestern Pipeline Company Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority to apply a 10%safety factor. For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications. Northern Natural Gas Company A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. EOTT A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. General Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held next week in Albuquerque. 
Due to internal issues, the BTU factor, previously reported to the marketers for the month of August 2000 as 1.027, was incorrect. The correct BTU factor for August 2000 is 1.029. Any questions may be directed to my attention. Amey Mesko Never Underestimate Initiative !!!! 908-289-5000,x 5263

John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA= =20 permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are. First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours= =20 of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation= =20 because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20 Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20 applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20 triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that= =20 they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that= =20 they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t= he=20 time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need= =20 some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon= g=20 it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20 converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin= g=20 with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th= e=20 PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro= l=20 technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know= =20 time is of the essence. Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and= =20 4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr= =20 or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm= vd=20 for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, = at=20 lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are= =20 40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we= =20 stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we= =20 applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented= =20 this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20 permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads= =20 and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20 conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with= =20 with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou= ld=20 bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue. =20

Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines. We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me know what additional information you may need. 1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest Operations. 2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower. The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20% of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load. 3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit. 4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas. Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the potential of becoming an ""opportunity"" in the event we are forced to deal with them.

Your allocation based on active customers in your group as of July 1, 2000 is 511 dt/day in the form of either: (a) a capacity release of Transco capacity at the Transco maximum rate for the 12-month period November 2000 through October 2001, or (b) a bundled citygate sale for November 2000 through March 2001 priced as follows: *  Inside F.E.R.C.=01,s first of the month index price at Transco/Zone 3 (Station 65) plus $1.00/dt. or; (c) a combination of the two adding up to 511 dt per day. Second, in addition to the above, we can make available to you 204 dt/day during March 2001 as a bundled citygate sale on the same terms as set forth above. Third, with respect to the balance of capacity that you may require to meet your primary point obligations, (a) There will be no citygate allocation requirements for this winter, except for the 25% limitation on Texas Eastern. (i.e., you may deliver     all of your gas to any of the following receipt points, except that no more than 25% may be delivered to Texas Eastern. Transco (Receipt Point: 134th Street - Manhattan, Central Manhattan, Narrows or Long Beach) Tennessee (Receipt Point:  White Plains) (b) We will permit you to meet the primary point requirement using your Daily Load Following Service Quantity (for Load Following Service)  or Daily Load Quantity (for Daily Delivery Service) during November instead of the Average Day/Peak Month quantity used during the remaining four winter months. (c) Prior to the winter, you can trade all or part of your citygate allocation on Texas Eastern to another marketer, so long as the aggregate entitlement for deliveries on Texas Eastern among all marketers remains below 25% of the combined total allocation. Please let us know on or before close of business Friday, July 28, 2000 which, if any, of the above-described services you are interested in. NOTES: 1. We will advise you if additional capacity becomes available as a result of actions taken by other marketers. 2. Bundled sales service is subject to the execution of a written agreement (on mutually agreeable terms), including a take-or-pay commitment and resolution of any creditworthiness issues.

NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY Submitted Title V Permit Renewal for Mullinville Compressor to the KDHE. Submittal of standard exemption documention for the NNG Kermit, Plainview, Seminole and Brownfield C/S's were submitted to the TNRCC. TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4. A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased. On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson Due to the great consternation caused by the revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my obligation to give an explanation to the population for my act of copulation. I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through masturbation, resulted in my fornication. I accepted her invitation, and provided her with excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and liberation. She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for duplication but I insisted upon termination, in spite of her fascination with variation. This has caused me great aggravation, and the agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in my humiliation, denigration, and degradation. My wife is considering castration, which would require my hospitalization. Pray that this matter will find culmination in my sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation has provided illumination and verification and will prohibit further provocation (or investigation). Sincerely, The Rev. Jesse Jackson __________________________________________________ Get personalized email addresses from Yahoo! Mail - only $35 a year!  http://personal.mail.yahoo.com/

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below: SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas. SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca. Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on 
After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we could choose this avenue if we desired.

don't worry about the margin call.  it's taken care of. 
Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.  I have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.  Take a look at the document and let me know what you think.  After your review we can make the necessary changes and modifications.  I have been advised by our legal department that each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will undoubtably work for the others.  Thanks for your patience in this.

John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure 
Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit issue: [Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting. I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.] I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, tomorrow. Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air permits: all earthwork trench construction and piping tie ins all foundation and building construction installation of ancillary equipment This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may allow us to do.

John, I look forward to you being there, hopefully,  for both days.  Your presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment from Houston. Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.  The second moring will be devoted to a  ""surprise"" participation at a local compressor station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.  I havent spread this around yet, except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they want.  The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams. thoughts comments...... 
Just to keep all permit information together, I spoke to Roger Kohn and he has sent to me the station 3 and 4 air permits.  We are now free to initiate construction at these two sites.... ""Van Wolf"" <vwolf@swlaw.com> on 11/20/2001 01:59:21 PM 
As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had copies of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory. Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M Hill, which is trying to start an air group in Arizona. I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued. He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed comments postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he expected both permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov. 30): he said he had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was not problemmatic. Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues, and that did not seem to be any difficulty. I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment period opened by first publication on October 17. The public hearing also must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and that is why it was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of days after what should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19, because Nov 17 was a Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check and get back to me. I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance starts dragging.

John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera to handle the panarama part of the equations.  In conversations with Doug Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you shortly after the trip... 
The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California. The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha. Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7. 
Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting= activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01. Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits an= d has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, t= he permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this= e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is comple= te, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prio= r to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on Octob= er 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  = The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov= . 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is locat= ed approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is = the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have b= een no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review proc= ess, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for meas= uring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fu= el monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced t= hem otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur anal= yzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There wa= s also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter = emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also. Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer f= or the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has = also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  T= here are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public c= omment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this dat= e, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign= off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As= of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the per= mits for station 3 and or 4. Ill keep everyone apprised of future events. 
John, in response to you questions below, im da man.  Ill call you today or tomorrow concerning  your possible suggestions and recommendations for dinner, blocking the rooms and the time for the event....the group had originally planned on blocking out 70 rooms.  Enough for the field DES's, safety specialists, env. and safety group in Houston, Danny Pribbles direct reports, Rich Jolly and his advisors, plus guests and speakers.......anyone else?

Particpated in the EPA NFL spill release and discharge data request for the Midland Region. A meeting was held with the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality Bureau concerning the NOV for the P-1 C/S.  Transwestern presented letters from the AQB to Transwestern which apparently had not been reviewed by the AQB prior to issuance of the NOV.  The AQB requested a delay to re evaluate the new evidence which had been given to them.  They indicated that they 
Leon, thanks for the list.  If this is a complete list of the parts which are replaced, what parts are ""common"" between the 3505 and the 4700?  Bill Scott is the attorney on this for Enron and I have copied him on this correspondence  ""wcs@modrallcom.""  Plese keep him in the loop on this......

Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet. A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year. Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern. Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed project for Transwestern Pipeline Company. Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th NFL meeting in MIdland. 
The State of New Mexico conducted a surprise air inspection of the TW Atoka No.3 C/S.  The agency found no non compliance issues or violoations during the inspection. The second quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee meeting was held this week.  Transwestern's share of the PCB management and disposal activities on the SoCal system for the quarter was $125,950.00. The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  The original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years without resolution, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.   A conference call will be set up to discuss Transwestern's next course of action. The summary report for due diligence conducted in Portland Ore. was completed and submitted to Environmental Affairs in Houston. 
Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along with them.... Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues. Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from the EPA.

The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are 
Jerry, I have not cancelled the Station 4 air permit.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn,EPA permit engineer,  about the possibility of not doing the turbine installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market commitment.  My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued about 2 years ago.  In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK. If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions of the existing permit for the facility.. 
Kevin, as promised, attached is the information that was found by David Roensch on environemntal perspectives in the Flagstaff area...... 
The Air Quality Bureau conducted an agency inspection of C/S's 7 Mountainair and 8 Corona.  There were no deficiencies or items of concern identified by the inspector. Facility records were copied from the Air Quality Bureas files in Santa Fe for the P-1 C/S. The excess emissions semiannual report as required under NSPS for turbines was submitted for the Bloomfield C/S. A custom fuel monitoring schedule  reqeust was submitted to Region VI EPA for the NNG Plains turbine C/S. Emissions fees were submitted for Laguna C/S. A meeting will be held with the vice president of development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation to begin preparation of a MOU between Enron and the Foundation.  The meeting will be held in Albuq. during the 1st or 3rd week in

This information is 9= 8%=20 complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the= =20 month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland=20 Region.  However, until the site visits are completed, this should give you= a=20 good idea of the status of the EOTT pipeline tanks stand with respect to ai= r=20 compliance. =20 1. Tank compliance database, general.  The database, which included 366 tan= ks=20 at the onset, has been reduced to 106 EOTT P/L tanks.  Tanks operated by EO= TT=20 Trucking; non-EOTT tanks;  tanks sold, removed, duplicated, or otherwise=20 listed in error, were removed (and saved in another file).  Of the 106 tank= s=20 listed, 80 are active, 12 are inactive, 10 are permanently out-of-service,= =20 and 4 are abandoned in place. =20 2. Permit issues.=20 Federal a. Title V permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Electric pumps a= re=20 the norm  at EOTT tank farms, so site emissions are exclusively from the=20 tanks and do not exceed 100 TPY.  (Only Crane Station has a Title V permit)= . =20 This statement is based on =01&worst case=018 calculations using EPA TANKS = 4.0=20 which indicated that in a: 5,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  3.6 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 7= 20=20 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 48 tons (2 tpy breathing loss, 46 t= py=20 working loss).=20 55,000 bbl EFR tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 255=20 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 9 tons (6 tpy breathing loss, 3 tpy= =20 working loss).=20 55,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e.,= =20 255 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 4 tons (1 tpy breathing loss, 3= =20 tpy working loss).=20 State=20 b. State permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Sixty-three (63) o= f=20 the 106 tanks were constructed before 1971 (and not modified or=20 reconstructed). These tanks are grandfathered and require no permit as long= =20 as throughputs do not significantly change. =20 All of the EOTT Texas tanks of any size constructed/modified/reconstructed= =20 after 1971 and equipped with a floating roof are exempt under Standard=20 Exemption 86, currently known as Permit-by-Rule 106.478.   None of the tank= s=20 store material with a true vapor pressure above 11.0 psia, and total actual= =20 VOC emissions authorized under exemption from any site does not exceed the = 30=20 TAC 106.4 limit of 25 tpy.   No registration for the exemption is necessary= ,=20 since the tanks are not located in a nonattainment county for ozone. New Mexico=01,s permitting program for petroleum storage tanks is being=20 developed but,  currently, there are no requirements. Therefore, all EOTT= =20 tanks in New Mexico meet state permit requirements.  However, when finalize= d,=20 the control requirements for tanks in New Mexico will not be more stringent= =20 than the federal NSPS Subpart Kb.  Therefore, a tank equipped with a floati= ng=20 roof would be authorized to store petroleum product with a true vapor=20 pressure up to 11.0 psia.   Only the four fixed roof tanks at Maljamar and= =20 the one at Loco Hills could be affected.=20 4. Recordkeeping and inspection issues.  The grandfathered tanks have no=20 requirements. For tanks subject to NSPS Subpart K, only capacity data is=20 required.  Tanks subject to Ka and Kb require inspection, repairs if=20 warranted, and recordkeeping. =20 Note: Especially for some of the older tanks, neither a manufacturer=01,s= =20 identification plate or=20 strapping table is available.  I would suggest that we pursue a records=20 search of old EOTT files to verify construction dates.  I dont know where t= o=20 start on this. 5. Specific compliance/requirements summary.  The tabled information=20 identifies the following: Federal - 2 tanks (McElroy 58005, Loco Hills 4602) may not be meeting NSPS control= =20 requirements - 4 tanks (Maljamar 1519-1522)  may not be meeting NSPS control requirement= s (All are cone tanks,  subject to Ka/Kb.

I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future. In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list. 
In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance: Hobbs team  August 6 8:00 am Lovington team  August 7 8:00 am Jal team  August 8 8:00 am Eunice team  August 9 8:00 am I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.  Your patience and assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.  If a 
Be advised that there will be a meeting on Thursday 11:00 am August 23 at the NNG Turbine station, south of Kermit Tx.  to complete and submit annual certification reports which are required by the following Title V permitted facilities: Seminole Brownfield Plainview Spraberry Irion Co. No. 1 Reagan Co. 2 Eldorado Wt-2 Walton Keystone Kermit Turbine Should a team decide not to attend this meeting, be advised that the required submittal date for the annual certifications for the state of Texas is September 8, 2001.  It will be your teams responsibility to ensure that the certifications are submitted prior to the 9/8/01 deadline should you decide

The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity generators of hazardous waste in Arizona. Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico. A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue. Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine 
I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to discuss the issue with Arco. 
Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion. In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple cycle. Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing. Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01. Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also. Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for station 3 and or 4. Ill keep everyone apprised of future events. 
Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the Foundation. Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification report submittals. Presented annual pollution prevention training for the Kingman and Flagstaff teams as required by the State of Arizona for large quantity generators of hazardous waste. Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components (inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to 
John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress. Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can ""advertise"" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
Eunice team,  The NNG Eunice C/S is required to prepare and submit the semi annual and annual reports required by the facilities Title V Operating Permit which was issued by the State of New Mexico.  The reports are required to be submitted to the state of New Mexico and the EPA by July 19, 2001.   These reports are required even though the facility is not in operation.  If you would like assistance in the preparation and submittal of each document, give me a call and we can set up a time to meet at the C/S to do each report. 
Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management. They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the Foundations new CEO........ Ivan.Hamilton.enronXgate@enron.com on 06/12/2001 09:03:46 AM

All, ? You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid $1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound congestion). ? As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be expected to be less  negative. ? Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered. ? NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today. ? Scott

Gary, I no longer work on the gas desk.  My replacement is Sherry Pendegraft.  Her number is 713.345.3461 
Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other compressor station locations and have been approved to use ""stain tubes"" or total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help. If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us? Kohn.Roger@epamail.epa.gov on 10/18/2001 05:54:40 PM 
Larry, I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31, which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer. Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP, there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks. 2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the sulfur content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, ""Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Fuel Gases"", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) ""Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and Radiometric Colorimetry,"" ASTM D5504-94 ""Standard Test Method for Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,"" or ASTM D3246-81 (Reapproved 1987) ""Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By Oxidative Microcoulometry"" (incorporated by reference under o  75.6).

Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA. 
I am no longer with the gas desk. Sherry is the contact person.

A presentation was given to the Transwestern Marketing Group in Houston over the PCB issues affecting sales of natural gas into western markets.  The history and future potential impacts of market stratgies were also discussed. A training session on the Dehy MACT was attended in Santa Fe which was sponsored by the state of New Mexico, apprising companies of forth coming requirements under Title III.  A request will be sent out ot the field for each location which has dehydration to complete a extended gas analysis and rich lean glycol samples.  Notification to the staes and EPA is due by June 17, 2000. A conference call was attended to discuss the C/S 8 turbine project and its fate.  Based upon submitted discussions it was decided to dispose of the turbine, compressor and auxillary box as a PCB contaminated waste and move the contaminated articles to a PCB landfill. The quarterly Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee mtg was held via conference call.  Invoices and charges were discussed which So cal had charged to their management and handling of PCB's on their system. At 86%, Transwestern's responsibility was $71,208.61. Clearances were received from the F&W and SHPO for the additional areas for the powerline transmission corridor of the Gallup C/S which is in progress. A custom fuel monitoring request wqas submitted to Region VI EPA for the Transwestern Lone Star Valero C/S. Installation and testing has been initiated on the precombustion chambers for the Superiors at the Atoka No. 3 C/S.   While fabrication is in progress for the correct chamber,  temporary Waukesha chambers were installed.  Even though the chambers were not of the correct size and configuration, a 12.5% fuel savings was achieved and emissions were reduced by over 56%.  The 
Mike I wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the PCB issue with PG&E.  Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution areas.  With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations (N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock and Hinckley C/S.  The good news is that PCB's have not been detected downstream of Hinckley which is approx. 160 miles from the Topock C/S.  PG&E has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly into customers.  the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter separators is still on target for 6/1/00. Now for the bad news.  At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.  This includes all piping and equipment.  I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no quarantees that the deconning would be successful.   The contract PCB deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 ug.  They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas continues to move through the system.  Additionally, the better remediation approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic locations.  Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management wanted the facility cleaned.  Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx. 3-5 million. I think that this is only the ""tip of the iceberg"".  If they are successful with this action, the pipeline system will be next.  Their pipeline is not piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc. 
Michael, our liquids data collections have been pretty lean.  Its only been in the last couple of months where we have actually collected any arsenic data.  I will send to you what data have have with respect to arsenic, including some historic reserch in the Abo field of southeast New Mexico where the arsenic is generated from down hole.  The source is not so much from what is coming out of the wells (catalyst towers were installed in the late 80's to trap the arsenic) as the residual which has collected in the pipeline prior to the installation of the catalyst towers....... ""Michael Adewumi"" <michael@pnge.psu.edu> on 02/23/2000 07:37:44 AM 
Gentlemen: We should be concluding discssions today with regard to the contracting and scope of work issues for our project with Penn State.  A number of data needs have been identified.  Please review available information for the following: Larry - Information related to arsenic - analytical/source informaition. Last three months of analytical on liquids from the pipeline.  We probably ought to pull together the liquids information from late 1998 to present. Sampling and lab protocols.  Any Liquids composition analysis. Earl - Station Three and Four Schematics, Alignment sheets (focus on Section 4 so we do not overwhelm the Professor's team). Gas composition analysis (primarily Needles). Eric - please forward this to Ben Asante, Terry Gallassini, Frank Osborne 
As a reminder, the state of Texas requires releases of natural gas greater than 119 mscf  to the atmosphere (in a 24 hour period), to be reported to the Regional Offices of the TNRCC.  These releases include but may not be limited to the following:  ESD's, startups, shutdowns, pipeline ruptures and maintenance activities.  Should any of the above activities release natural gas in excess of 119 mscf, a written notification should be faxed to the Regional Office of the TNRCC  within the following timeframes: Unanticipated Upsets- within 24 hours after the discovery of the upset. Maintenance, Startup or Shutdowns- 10 day prior to the expected exceedance. This reminder is being sent to all ET&S teams within Texas because in the last two Northern Natural Gas compressor station inspections conducted by the TNRCC,  they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 119 mscf.  The agency's  inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor station venting for ESD, start ups and shutdowns. It should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the TNRCC's position regarding this issue.  However, until a position has been adopted by Enron's GPG, I am recommending that each facility comply and report as appropriate. The fax numbers for the following Regional offices are as follows: Midland (915)  570-4795    Included facilities-  Wt-2, Walton, Keystone, Lone Star Valero, Spraberry, Seminole Lubbock (806)  796-7107  Included facilities-  P-2, Plainview, Brownfield San Angelo (915)  658-5431  Included facilities- Reagan Co. 2, Irion Co. 1, Eldorado Reporting forms for the release can be faxed to your location by request by contacting me at (505) 625-8022. 
Just a short note to let you know that I received a call from Rod Bosche of PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday. They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E system.   From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by them which Louie has a copy of.  The statement is a little harsh and makes some statements which are incorrect.  Louie and I are planning to attend this meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.  The results of this meeting 
Steve, you have been given all the written permit history and portable analyzer correspondance from myself to and from the State of New  Mexico. All of my air permit files were copied and sent to you previously.  If there is confusion, I apologize but everything that has been agreed to by the State of New Mexico has been made available for review and use. If I need to sit down with you and or others to go over this, let me know. Steve SanMiguel 03/13/2000 08:12 PM 
Larry This will work just fine, just after the call is made to me concerning a NM Audit, please send me a lotus note concerning this request. Their have been to misunderstandings and confusion concerning portable testing in New Mexico and I need this for my protection. Again if their are any questions or concerns pertaining to this request, I encourage anyone to call.

Steve due to New Mexico's new focus on conducting surprise inspections, there may not  be the opportunity of advanced notice.  In  the effort to keep everyone in the loop,  notification will be made to those individuals when I receive a call from the state. Steve SanMiguel 03/09/2000 08:42 PM 
Larry and Butch In the future if their is a request for portable testing in State of New Mexico, or if the AQB is performing an audit at any facility, I will support and go where ever necessary day or night. I would only ask that after the call that this is put in Lotus notes for my personal records. I'm sure you can understand. If anyone has any questions or concerns please feel free to call.

On tuesday of this week, Lou Soldano and I attended a meeting between the above referenced parties concerning the issue of PCB's which had migrated into the PG&E system.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E's and recieves natural gas from PG&E for delivery to its customers,   PG&E has prepared a media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which receive gas from interconnects testing positive for PCBs.  As of today, only the customer base around Needles, California will see the PG&E statement. The two issues of note.  First, Transwestern was able to make some minor changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that this release of PCBs was an isolated incident and that all parties are diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release. A copy of the revised media statement is available upon request  from Louie or myself. Second,   PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the Southwest Gas system to determine if the PCB's have spread into parts of their system. Results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled in a couple of weeks.  Transwestern will probably atttend this meeting. 
The air permit application (APEN) for the the turbine power unit exchange for the La Plata C/S was submitted to the state of Colorado. A meeting was attended with Southwest Gas and PG&E in Las Vegas concerning PG&E's forthcoming media statement which it will distribute to the selected sectors of the public informing them of the discovery of PCB's received from Transwestern.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E.  PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct sampling activities on the Southwest Gas system to determine presence and extent of possible PCB contamination on the Southwest system.

Mike, I spoke to Ralph and he gave me an open week of April 17th in San Francisco.  He thought that one day would be more that adequate.  I need to have somebody contact the PG&E side for their availablity during that week. Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end with our legal contacting their legal? Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was the following: PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry of the unknown) Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage their PCBs Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental impacts have occurred Michel Nelson 03/28/2000 09:18 AM 
Excellent - If possible, I would wish to attend, as well. I approve the expense and hourly rate. Might be the bargain of the century. Mike Larry Campbell 03/28/2000 08:47 AM 
I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB expert for SoCal, concerning his availability to conduct a training session for PG&E and enlighten them on the reality of PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  He has stated that he would be available to do this as long as Transwestern picks up his expenses and hourly rate ($200.00/hr).  As per your approval, Louie, I will inform Ralph that we are in agreement with his conditions and I will schedule a day when he would be available in California to put on the training for PG&E. 
A meeting was held with the Roswell Team at C/S No 8 discuss roles and responsibilities of the Title V Operating Permit for the Corona C/S. The sale of the TW Crawford C/S has been cancelled.  A permit revision was requested to the Air Quality Bureau to transfer the new permit to the existing facility to keep intact the ability to conduct turbine power unit replacements without agency notification. Preparations are in place for the forthcoming meeting between PG&E and Transwestern over PCB issues on their mainline.  Analytical shows that the PCB's are continuing to move further downstream into their system.  Ralph Komai, with SoCal, will make a presentation concerning  SoCal's experience with PCBs on mainline and LDC systems and present it during the 4/20 meeting in San Francisco. The annual certification for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was reveiwed for completion and submitted to M. Nelson for signature. 
One of you folks should try and listen in on this.

Michael, we may have to petition the teams for theri analytical ""Michael Adewumi"" <michael@pnge.psu.edu> on 04/24/2000 03:04:43 PM 
Tiny, I have been sending the analyticals to Michael.  I m sorry that they are not reaching him.  Ill switch to plan B.  I will  have hard copies of the analyticals he needs when I see you in Gallup on Thursday.  I have attached my PCB file to this memo for review. (See attached file: Pcb.xls) David Roensch 04/19/2000 06:22 PM 
Please see the attached file and notes on this years pigging activites from Station 5 through Needles.  This does not include all the analyticals for this time period but should represent 90% of all pigging activites.  Filter and scrubber samples may also exist. Larry can you give a hand with this?  I thought these results were already forwarded to Penn State weeks ago and being forwarded on an ongoing basis. They have yet to receive any historical sampling data either.  Please advise. (See attached file: 011600.xls) 
Rich, this is the public notice for the groundwater remediation at the TW North Crawar facility. Because we are emitting emissions to the air from the contamination in the groundwater, we had to have a permit..... 
Larry, the attached file contains a scanned image of a story that was published in The Monahans News, a weekly paper, on Thursday, April 20, 2000. I've shown the story to Bill, and he suggested that you let Rich Jolly know about the story. Thanks, George 
I hope this works.  MM 
Four of the six new monitor wells at the Laguna C/S have accumulated groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from these wells on April 5th. Lab results indicate elevated concentrations of halogenated organic compounds in samples collected from two of the wells. Three replacement wells will be drilled for the two wells which do not produce water and for one of the wells which only has two feet of water in the screen interval. The installation of the replacement wells is tentatively scheduled for the week of May 8th. A feasibility study for active remediation measures in the former impoundment area has been completed. The Lockridge semiannual groundwater sampling was completed.  Results will be forwarded to the state of Texas. The quarterly groundwater sampling at the NNG Gomez Plant was completed. The recovery system was shutdown from January 17th through April 21st in order to evaluate the accumulation rate of PSH in recovery wells. The accumulation rate of PSH has been reduced considerably from the accumulation rate prior to active remediation. The system was re-started on April 21st and will be operated in a similar manner as it was operated prior to the shutdown. Transwestern Pipeline Company met with officials of PG&E to discuss recent sampling activities on the PG&E system with respect to PCB's.  Results of the sampling efforts have shown that PCB's have moved downstream into existing interconnects and into lines which feed customers.  PG&E has indicated that they will install small filter separators at these interconnects at pricing thus far of around $2MM.  This does not include the costs for the mainline filter separators which should be in service in June of this year.   PG&E has indicated that they will continue sampling at downstream locations to further 
The issues discussed during the May 1, 2000 environmetnal conference call were as follows: Home Officing- Employees within OTS and EHS have been asked to pilot a telecommunicating and home officing program.  The reson being to make available desirable office space within the Enron, Three Allen Center and Brookhollow office buildings. MIke Terraso's Replacement-    John Shafer has been selected to replace Mike Terraso as V.P. of GPG for Environmental and Safety.  John was formerly Director of Environmetnal and Safety for ANR Pipeline out of Chicago, Ill. John will assume responsibilities within Enron on May 8. Performance Testing of Grandfathered Units-   There was some confusion with repsect to the internal position within GPG of testing grandfathered units. It was understood by some team members that internal portable emissions testing would only occur if the grandfathered unit had permitted limits on an air permit  or if there was a special need by the DES.  In order to clarify this issue, Bill will discuss this with legal and distribute a notice to the appropriate individuals within GPG outlining the GPG position on testing . Skill Base Pay- Bill is suggesting a reworking of the O&M, field trainee, and Level I, II and III training modules and TV Guides by the SBP review committee.  Bill will distribute to the committee existing documents for reworking and revision.  The committee will reveiw, make changes and return back to Bill by the mid term review meeting. O&G MACT-    Bill will approach Marc Phillips about conducting an internal training for all DES personal on the forthcoming notification and conditions of the Oil and Gas MACT regulation and its applicability to the facilities in GPG.  Bill will notify each DES as to when the meeting is scheduled and where.  An Enron letter will be developed and distributed to the field by 5/5 to notify EPA of those facilities which are impacted by the new MACT regulations.  It will be the DES's responsibility to make the notification to the EPA. MId Term Peer Review Meeting-   Bill Kendrick, Rick Cates and Ken Crowl will keep the DES's apprised of the details relevant to the mid term review process and procedures to be employed for doing the review. Cooling Tower Issue-     A request was made by BIll Kendrick to send legal a list of histortic or active cooling tower sites within GPG, that may have impacted groundwater at a site.   The criteria to be used for this notification is knowledge of chromate use in the cooling tower and/or relative proximity to a nearby recptor (drinking water well). Tracking Cleanup Costs-    MIke Terraso has requested work orders to be generated for tracking costs associated with cleanup and remedation of spills and releases.  The ""cut line"" for the work order generation is $1,000. 
Larry, as per our conversation, presented below are the emissions factors provided by the state of Colorado for the T-7000 Centaur under permit 97LP0653 : PM10   14.000/MMSCF TSP   14.000/MMSCF NOx   0.100/MMBTU CO   0.121/MMBTU VOC   0.0348/MMBTU Formaldehyde  0.00438/MMBTU acetaldehyde  0.00546/MMBTU As you already know, the emissions factors for the Centaur 50H turbine under permit 97LP0885 can be found on page 5 of this permit which was issued on October 6, 1999. Remember, the state has given us until May 19 to have the rolling emissions 
A records review training was given to the Carlsbad Team.   Files were established and purged of historic and non applicable documents. A check in the amount of $5,250.00 was delivered to the TNRCC for the late annual certifications required under the Title V air permit program. All dehys in Albuquerque region were entered into the GRI GLYCALC software to determine applicability to the O&G MACT standard.  Preliminary determinations indicate that no dehys will not be subject to the  new rule. An inspection was conducted of the Transwestern Pipeline Keystone C/S landfarm by the Railroad Commission of Texas.  The inspection went well and no deficiencies ro violations were identified by the agency. Title V air permit for the two Arizona C/S's (Leupp and Klagetoh) which are on the Navajo Indian reservation were issued by the USEPA.  The permits seem to be very lenient in terms of requirements.  Meetings have been scheduled with each field team to assign roles and responsibilities to ensure 
George/Norm because there is no immediate concern or liability with the partially filled excavation, I want us wait for the official letter from the tribe before taking it upon ourselves to fill the excavation.  I dont want to send  a message to the Lagunas about us taking environmental matters into our own hands without involvement from the tribe.  If there is a reason to expidite the covering of this open area, then lets  send another  letter requesting to do so.  Given the other issues yet to be resolved at the station, lets keep the tribe involved and a part of our environmental activities.  I want to maintain a good working relationship with these people. As you may remember, they were a little irritated by Transwestern's neglect of not keeping them in the loop previously.  Lets not open that type of issue again...... George Robinson 05/05/2000 02:00 PM 
Norm: Per our telephone discussion this afternoon, I suggest you go ahead and backfill what remains of the open excavation that was created when the diesel UST was removed. A closure report was submitted to Ms. Bernacik of the Laguna Pueblo Environmental Department in January. We have not received a formal response from the Pueblo yet, but in a phone conversation, Ms. Bernacik indicated that they would have to take a closer look at the report before making a decision. Regardless, I don't think we need to wait on an approval of the closure report before backfilling the excavation. Thanks, George 
will do.... Rich Jolly on 05/15/2000 10:25:38 AM

1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project. Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system. PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, according to PG&E, are in place. PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ET&S. Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe. 2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's. Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co.  system which is PCB free. 3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program. Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced. It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks. 4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators. Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm. Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries. PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations. 5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators. a. Siting, Design and Engineering b. Cost Estimates PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter separators may be proposed for installation. The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PG&E presented. One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it will be a 2001 project. 6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection. Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle. 7. Other Issues or Concerns. Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern. PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day. 8. Next Steps. The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
Another meeting was held with PG&E to discuss results of the latest sampling and construction activities on their system.  DAta from sampling has shown that PCB's are steadily increasing into further portions of the PG&E system. The latest sampling results showed positive hits on their mainline system at MP 63.26 where 4 oz. of liquids were removed from a siphon.  The analytical result of this liquid was 10 ppm.  PG&E and Southwest Gas are continuing their internal sampling efforts to identifiy additional places within their systems where PCB's may collect  and would be passed on to their customers. It should also be noted that  PG&E is and will be continuing their efforts of installing small filter separators at strategic interconnects to protect and remove PCBs from entering customer and LDC lines. Annual emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the TW  Walton and NNG Seminole and Plainview C/S's Title V air permits were receied from Region IX EPA for the Leupp and Klagetoh C/S's, which are on the Navajo Reservation.  A roles and responsibilities meeting was held with the Flagstaff Team for the Leupp Title V permit.  A meeting will be scheduled with the Gallup in the near future to assign roles and responsibilities for the Klagetoh permit. The Quarterly groundwater sampling has been completed at the NNG Gomez Plant. Semiannual groundwater sampling has been completed at the following Transwestern locations:  C/S No. 5 Thoreau, North Crawar C/S.  Semi annual groundwater sampling has been completed at the NNG Lockridge facility. Three additional groundwater monitoring wells will be installed at  C/S No. 
Thanx George for the update. Norm would you mind visiting with Ms. Bernacik and explaining to her the difference between the excavation area where the underground tanks were removed and the landfarm area?  If need be we can write her another letter requesting the closure and backfilling of the underground storage tanks. George Robinson 05/25/2000 04:12 PM 
I called Ms. Bernacik this afternoon regarding several issues. 1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date for sampling. 2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th. 3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two additional monitor wells in the former UST area. 4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation, if we still want to get this in writing, it may be best for Norm to visit with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need.

Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson Due to the great consternation caused by the revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my obligation to give an explanation to the population for my act of copulation. I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through masturbation, resulted in my fornication. I accepted her invitation, and provided her with excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and liberation. She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for duplication but I insisted upon termination, in spite of her fascination with variation. This has caused me great aggravation, and the agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in my humiliation, denigration, and degradation. My wife is considering castration, which would require my hospitalization. Pray that this matter will find culmination in my sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation has provided illumination and verification and will prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

Received the ""permit by rule"" approval for the turbine power unit changeout for the Keystone C/S. The emissions testing results for the Plains Turbine Station was submitted to the TNRCC. Discharge renewal applications for C/S No. 9 and Monument Turbine C/S were submitted to the OCD. Notification to the New Mexico AQB was given for the power turbine changeout at the Atoka No. 2 C/S. One employee was skill verified for level II environmental During the routine weekly sampling of the PG&E system, it was discovered that approx. 3 oz of liquid had collected in the new filter separator in the PG&E C/S yard.  A request was made to analyze the liquid for not only PCB's but also pH to determine if the liquids resulted from the caustic and water cleaning of the upstream portion of the pipe leading into the PG&E C/S . This is the first occurance of liquids at this location since this new filter

During the quarterly conference call with SoCal in which we discuss PCB costs on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.  As a result of the PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect. Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77 ppm. Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following: Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered Data collected in 1998 showed that approx. 8% of the liquids were greater than 50 ppm Data collected in 1999 showed that approx. 9% of the liquids were greater than 50 ppm Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now. I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been collected.   We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased flows from TW into SoCal. Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions resulting from the recent ""hits"".  He just indicated that they would be 
Atttended the NMOGA meeting in Farmington, NM.  It appears that the BLM will implement its own noise criteria in areas within New Mexico that are deemed sensitive by the BLM.  The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A). There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted. A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur concentrations in the natural gas.  A  request  was made to the company to determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste. The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week. Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx. $79,000.  Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.  Preliminary sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm was discovered. As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.  A meeting has been scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities 
A meeting was held in Laughlin, Nv with PG&E to discuss the liquids which were received and analytical result of 505 ppm which occurred at the PG&E F/S.  Additional discussions centered around the latest migration of PCB's into the PG&E system and control technologies to stop additional migration of PCB's into PCB free portions of their distribution system. Annual emission fees were paid to the ADEQ for C/S No. 1, Kingman in the amount of  $31,145.26 Annual hazardous waste fees were paid to the DTSC for the facilities that operate in the state California A  meeting was held in Albuquerque to discuss and apprise involved parties of histoirc and proposed activities for 2000 for the 10 groundwater remediation projects currently being conducted in Texas and New Mexico.

As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 6/29/00. Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit. The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator. The following samples were collected during this project: On the Transwestern side: 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample) 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup. 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. On the PG&E side: 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior to deconning was approximately one gallon. 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 cm sq. wipe) 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters. 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have reprensentataive samples of both materials. Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with PG&E. on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time.

Witnessed the the NSPS emissions testing which was performed on the turbine units at the TW Bloomdfield and La Plata C/S in New Mexico and Colorado, respectively. Assisted the San Juan team with the preparation and submittal of the 6 month compliance monitoring report and the annual certification under the Title V 
When we do the emissions testing at C/S No. 3, Luepp, we should be aware of the positives and negatives.  The positives being the information which Steve and company will collect.  This appears to be a  very useful tool.  There is also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this facility.  There also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly lower than what was placed into the permit application.  The downside to this effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the difference (1996 to the present).  Additionally, enforcement action could result by the Navajos.  I say this to apprise everyone of the positive and negative potentials involved in completing this study.  From the emission estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the temperature, humidity, engine age and poor engine mechanics should they exist. And finally, we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually emit.  These units have never been tested.  This uncertanty in itself may be the driver to know so as not to have a situation which was similar to what happened at Atoka No. 3 several months ago. 
A meeting was held with the Eunice Team to assign roles and responsibilities for the newly issued Title V air permit for the NNG Eunice C/S.  The permit is similiar to the other title V permits issued to New Mexico faciliites. Assisted the Gallup Team with the preparation, completion and submittal of the Title V semi anual compliance monitoring report and annual certification report. The state of New Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted an inspection of the Wt-1 C/S.  This inspection is interesting in the fact that all combustion equipment has been removed and dismantled and replaced by electric units. Written notification was submitted to the agency several months ago and a written reply was received from the agency that the facility is exempt from any and all permitting requirements. A meeting was held with the Artesia Team to assign roles and responsibilities for the newly issued Title V air permit for the Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Also discussed was the permitting approach which will be followed for the approval to install micro pre combustion chambers on two White units which were found to be out of compliance with the air permit emissions limits when the New 
I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB engineer with SoCal, about a pipeline liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.  Ralph said that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in the past couple of  years (97-2000). I shared with Ralph and up until this year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.  He stated that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).  He said that their data shows the following: 1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level 1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with the collection. I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for 
Louie/John, this memo summerizes the results of the environmental due diligence which was performed on the Texas Panhandle and Cortez, Colorado portions of Equilon pipline system for which EOTT may be interested in purchasing.  This memo presents those environmental issues which may be or were identified as a potential environmental concern. Lefors (Texas Panhandle Segment) Assets on this portion of the system which may have environmental  issues were the following:  1-80,000 bbl. liquids product storage tank, 41 small tank batteries consisting of 1-3 product storage tanks each.  Average tank size is 210 bbl.  Approximately 15 tank locations are within 1/4 mile of an existing waterway.  There are stream and river crossings included in this package.  The pipeline crossings viewed appeared to have sufficient  soil coverage and did have block valves on the upstream and downstream portions of the pipeline crossings. 1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V. The  following documents were not present:  emissions inventories and or records of fees paid, O&G MACT compliance (HAP's),  operating permits.  NSPS Supart Kb compliance could not be determined also.  The 80,000 bbl tank construction date was in the 1930's and has a fixed roof.  It has a concrete bottom and the  tank has never been emptied for inspection.  No  Railroad Commission 653 inspection has ever been conducted. 2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present around all tanks that were inspected, SPCC plans were not available at any location.   Interviews with the Equilon personnel stated that there had never been a reportable release from this tank.  In addition, location Texaco MB Davis pump  station had a small 3'x4' UST which received liquids from leaking packing material which had overflowed and visible soil staining was present. At this  location a T-stand pipe had been constructed into the soil berm to allow discharge of rainwater from the containment area.  This water discharged into  an ephermal arroyo which ultimately collects into the North Fork of the Red River, a perennial stream. 3. NESHAPS.  At the Lefors Station, there exists several joints of new and used pipe which is suspected of having external coating and pipe wrapping containing asbestos. 4. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets which are identified in the bid package. 5. Soil Staining.   There was minor soil staining at all locations inspected. 6. There is one active groundwater remediation in progress identified as the ""10 mile hole"".  Equilon will retain ownership of this issue.  There had been two  pipeline remediation projects for which Equilon had reported to the TRRC and had remediated the site. 7. TSCA.  One electrical transformer was discovered at the Lefors Station. It had been tested and determined to not have PCB's. 8. Safe Drinking Water Act.  There was an abandoned drinking water well at the Lefors Station.

Larry, YOU ARE THE BEST!   Thank you !   Look at it before you give it out! Thanks Z 
I want to bring interrested parties up to date on the issue of replacing the fuel mixers with carbuerators at  the Spraberry Plant.  It seems that this replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.  According to the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.  To do this they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their approval.  IE before and after testing.  I am going to request that we be allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing in a third party referenced testing company.  Contractor testing runs about $3-5,000. A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the agency.  In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one unit to be tested but not on all units.  Should testing show other exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger actions requiring perimtting.  Under the circumstances, I think it would be in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting, we comply immediately. I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.  If approved, we should test ASAP.  Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.  Let me know 
A phase I due diligence was completed for EOTT on two liquids pipeline segments in the Texas Panhandle and in Northwestern Colorado.  The assets are owned by Equilon Pipeline Company.  A copy of the findings have been submitted to Legal.  There were some deficiencies and potential liabilities discovered as a result of this activity. Assisted the Roswell team in the preparation and completion of the 6 month and 12 Title V certification reports for the Roswell C/S.  No deficiencies or non compliance issues were identified for this 12 month period. Annual certification reports were submitted to the TNRCC for 3 Transwestern and 8 Northern Natural Gas C/S in west Texas.  There wer no deficiencies or non compliance issues identified for any of the 11 facilities during this 12 month period. The TNRCC reviewed the emissions testing report for the NNG Plains C/S and requested modification to the original report submitted.  The testing contractor was contacted and  a revised report was submitted to the agency. 
I received word from the TNRCC that they will allow a portable emissions test at the Spraberry C/S to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions.  I will send out the letter today to the TNRCC reqesting written approval to do the testing.  I would strongly recommend that the Spraberry Team have the sampling ports installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing completed ASAP.  Remember, the unit selected must be tested with the fuel mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator on.  Whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that

Max, I spoke to Pete Metzner of METRIC Corporation about the status of the environmental assessment you need for the above project and he said that he has received the packet you sent him but he needs to have additional clearification on some items which are pertinant for completing the EA.  Mr. Metzner was concerned that he would not be able to complete the EA by the specified time unless he discussed these issues with you.  METRIC has extensive experience with environmental assessments, but is not familiar with pipeline terminology and pipeline actions proposed uder the agreement with the Office of Pipeline Safety. When you get a chance, would you please contact Pete at (505) 828-2801.

Particpated in a Consolidated audit of two facilities on the Northern Border Pipeline system.  Very few items of concern were identified. Submitted to the state of Texas Fish and Wildlife Service annual blanket renewal requests. Submitted to the state of Arizona Shpo annual blanket renewal requests. Submtted to the state of New Mexico Shpo and Fish and Wildlife Service annual blanket renewal requests. A natural gas relase of 1.57MMscf was reported to the state of New Mexico and Houston GPG for a line lowering in an agricultural area. The quarterly Transwestern SoCal PCB conference meeting was held. Transwestern's share of PCB activities on the SoCal system at 86% was 
George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
Go for it! George Robinson 04/27/99 04:14 PM 
I began discussions regarding this issue with Sonny, an employee of Cliffwood Oil & Gas, operator of the Ft. Stockton Unit Water Station. This is the outfit that was taking our recovered groundwater. Sonny discussed this with Cliffwoods' reservoir engineers in Houston and they decided they did not want to accept this water regardless of permit status due to their concern that the relatively fresh water may cause calcium carbonate to precipitate in the disposal well perforations and plug up their well. Lee Cisneros of 4C Construction, the outfit hauling the recovered water, put me in touch with Kenneth McIntyre of Stockton Water Inc. Kenneth informed me that they would accept the water if permit condition would allow it. Kenneth said they would dispose of the water in one of two wells, their University 165 or RS Pershing Well#1. This afternoon I discussed the issue of disposal of recovered water with Doris at the TRC District 8 office. Doris looked up the permit for these two wells and informed me that they were permitted for produced water only. After further discussion of the situation she transferred my call Mark Henkhaus, District 8 Director. Mark said that normally this waste stream would go to an ""oil and gas waste"" disposal facility as you had pointed out in our meeting last week, but suggested an alternative. Mark suggested that I obtain a letter of no objection from the operator of the SWD disposal well and transmit the letter with a request for approval from his office to dispose of the recovered water in the SWD disposal well for a period not to exceed 12 months. He said he will issue an approval for such a request. I think this will be the most cost effective manner to manage recovered water over the next few months, particularly if recovery operations continue to proceed as favorably as they have to date and we can cease active remediation activities toward the latter part of this year. If you concur, I will obtain the letter from the disposal well operator and submit the request to the TRC. Thanks, George

Larry, Could you take a look at the attached file's, and answer question concerning Environmental Permit / Survey at Keystone.  I am not to sure about some of these questions. Many Thanks, Dennis 
This is a message from Kerry. I just converted and moved Larry Campbell (lcampbe) to the W2K server.  He uses ESIS.  I successfully converted the tables and have the links corrected (logged in as kgramse), however Larry cannot use the system.  I received a message while logged in as Larry stating that the data/application was ""Read-Only"" when I attempted to re-link the tables. Please check the permissions on GTROS-FS01P\APPSRW Thanks, 
Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.  Wipe tests taken of the interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.   This was not a standard wipe taken of a specific area.  These wipes were taken over large areas to determine presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.  After the cleaning operation was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the separator.  All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.  I feel we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs. 
I received a call from a permit engineer with the Arizona Dept. of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) concerning the issue of notification of mechanical activities at C/S 2  Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period for agency review and approval.   Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being performed, I had written a notification to the agency friday evening requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work which was included with the letter.  On Monday, the engineer called and said that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding at the C/S.  After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a change in design.  After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without any notification to the agency. The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise them of such an activity..... 
Lorraine, I dont have a problem with continuation of this sampling, but we better hear from our conservative tight fisted attorney first.... Lorraine Lindberg 11/10/2000 02:02 PM 
I am in the process re-negotiating PNM's FT on TW.  PNM has requested that TW continue to sample for contaminants at Rio Puerco, Belen and Ft. Wingate on a semi-annual basis during the term of the new contract which could be as long as five years out from 10/01.  Are we planning on continuing to sample these points in the East of Thoreau area?  Are there any objections to agreeing to this sampling? Thanks for your quick reply. Lorraine 
I had dinner tonight with a Robert Jacobs EOTT  V.P. West Coast and Ed Attanasio EOTT Senior Counsel.  This dinner meeting was put together by Gary Fuller.  Both Jacobs and Attansio expressed serious concern about ETS's abilty to provide environmental expertise and representation at the EOTT Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our customer, I told them I would pass on this information to the powers to be in Houston. After a review of the environmental records and the compliance load for what Gary has responsible for,  Im wondering if we should  fill the Bakersfield position, or move that position to Midland and possibly use Gary as a ""temporary technical contact"" for ETS.  As you may or may not know, Gary is accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes in providing operation services for energy companys.  Gary will be in charge of the environmental  and safety responsibilities for those companies which choose to use their service. I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that does, at times go above what is required in other states.  However, getting the employees at the Bakersfield location on board with skill base pay will alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled and addressed  by Butch and myself with Gary's occasional assistance.  Having Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person of Gary's reputation and character. In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and compliance will be a full time position with the EOTT, Transwestern and Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training for.  I feel this will be a full time job.  I think we should give consideration to possible using Gary's expertise on a part time basis in 
I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal concerning new hits of PCBs at regulator sites on the Southwest Gas system.  It appears that SWG did some liquids sampling at two regulator locations near Victorville, Ca. and found small volumes of liquid accumulations (less than 2 oz.).  They tested the liquid for PCBs and found concentrations of 230 and 132 ppm.  The aroclors for the two samples were not known at the time of Ralph's notification to me but he stated that SWG plans to do further testing at their other 17 regulator locations.  This additional testing will be conducted in the near future and Ralph stated that he would share the results of his sampling with me.  It should be noted that the location of the two positive hits  were immediately downstream of where SoCal delivers gas to SWG. If we need to discuss this further, contact me at my home  (505) 624-0353 as 
Bill, Just a short note to let you know whats going on at Bakersfield.  I have spoken to the agency inspector about one of the NOV issues and have been told that EOTT will definately receive a an NOV and fine for failure to conduct the emissions testing on a heater that apparently should have been tested approx. 6 months ago.  With repsect to the other NOV issue, Rick Suderman had a testing company in to perform emissions testing on another heater which was required to be tested by today.  As the testing contractor began his testing, an 02 issue developed with the equipment the testing company was using and a miscommunication on the part of the testing contractor was directed to Rick.  As a result,  the  the inspector observed elevated CO readings from the heater that  Rick had made adjustments in the heater set points (based upon recommendations from the contractor) causing the elevated CO readings to result.  The inspector stated that the facility would receive another NOV for this exceedance.   In any event this isssue was NOT Rick's fault and was due to some bad communication on the part of the contractor.  We have sent the testing company home and will be bringing in another testing company (AEROS) on thursday.  This is the contractor who has done the majority of the previous emissions testing for the facility to complete the heater testing and substantiate the innaccuracy of the first testing company's data.  With this new data, we shold be able to demonstrate inaccuracy in the first testing company's QA/QC. It should also be mentioned that we have identified other environmental issues which we should discuss at your convenience.  Butch and I will have completed the permit compliance investigataion and be available for discussions on friday. William Kendrick 01/10/2001 07:53 AM 
Rich/Ed--- Larry Campbell is going to Bakersfield this  week to address the situation. I have asked him to put together a compliance calendar for the Bakersfield facility outlining regulatory deadlines required by the permits and regulations.  He has discussed the testing due on one of the heaters this week with the regulators and there does not appear to be an issue.  It is my understanding that the heater will be performed this week.  Larry will look into the best course of action necessary to address the engine testing that was apparently missed last year.  He will be discussing the matter with Gary.   Please call with any questions. Thanks, Bill 713.646.7644 Rich Jolly 01/09/2001 05:24 PM 
Ed thanks for the information. Bill Kendricks from Houston has asked Larry Campbell to work with Rick on getting this resolved. I talked with Larry today and he was going to give Rick a call. Rich Edward_Attanasio@eott.com on 02/23/2000 12:53:54 PM 
I just spoke with Gary Fuller who informed me that we have been notified by the Air District that we are getting an NOV for missing a source test in December (apparently on one of our IC engines.)  Now, while this is not the end of the world, we put ourselves at potential risk if we do not follow up properly -- especially given the history of this plant with this Air District (that is, the Koch troubles that resulted in a criminal investigation from some relatively minor problems, really.) In fact, I believe that if we act promptly and conduct the source test now we stand a very good chance of having this NOV rescinded.  But we must act.  I am please to see that we still have Gary on the job, and I hope he can follow through with this.  I have asked him to do so, and also to handle reporting of the soil contamination at NCL that we have all discussed at length.  I have done so because delay works against us on both of these issues.  Gary, though, is somewhat reluctant to act without instruction directly from ETS (which is understandable, given that ETS runs things.)   He seems to feel that he should be getting direction from Cutty Cunningham, although I must confess I don't know enough yet about the structure of ETS to know why this is the case. In any event, I asked Gary to talk to whomever he needed to, but these matters needed to be handled in the short run.  Obviously, we will discuss next week what is to be done for the long run.  In the meantime, I would greatly appreciate whatever you folks can do to help grease the wheels to make Gary feel he has authority to act to get these more immediate problems addressed.  Thanks a bunch. 
Tracy, thanks for the heads up.  Beginning in January of 2000, provide me with the new and old serial numbers for each unit and a closer exchange date, as things (scheduling, changeout activities etc.) tend to move dates around. Team San-Juan 05/14/99 09:31 AM

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico (ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo. The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, and send the results to POEP for review. With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different. The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
This is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at  the Spraberry C/S has been submitted to t he TNRCC.   The data showed fuel savings, as we had hoped it would and we also received an emissions reduction benefit.  According to the agency, this replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will be a plus for the company. My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make 
Ralph, I received the attached from John Shafer and thought about its applicability for use in abandoning your PCB distribution lines. Let me know...... 
You may have an interest in learning more about this product.? If not, that is also fine.? John 
I contacted John Sailane with Invatech responding to his call to Dr. Terraso. The material is a polyurethane foam used to fill pipes that are being abandoned in place.? He will send me some promotional information. Some not-yet-updated information is available on the web at http://www.roartech.com/megafill/claiming that: ?? Over 1000 lf. of pipe can be filled per day. ??? The line will be filled with polyurethane foam to over 50% capacity ??? (in most cases 100%). ?? Meets PCB Mega Rule (TSCA). ?? Eliminates your need to track retired underground natural gas lines. ?? No need for the one call system to be used for retired gas lines. ?? Eliminates the generation of potentially hazardous waste water ?? created by the rinsing method of abandonment. ?? No waiting for test results. ?? No cost for analytical. ?? GPS equipped trucks. He said they have now filled pipelines up to 42"" diameter. 
Rick, Terry had informed me that Solar had trouble with this unit in making its emissions guarantees, prior to shipping it to La Plata.  I was not aware of this when I permitted the unit.a couple of years ago. In an attempt to solve the problem, in November,  I had submitted a modification to the permit to the state of Colorado  requesting additional emissions as it appears the unit exceeds its permitted levels during the colder months.  I received a call form the state of Colorado and they said they are hesitant to approve of more emissions for us.  We reached an agreement with the state that they would remove the pound per hour limit and keep the ton per year requirement in an attempt to give us more operating room (the higher emissions months would be balanced by the warmer months which produce less emissions. However, after Terry went through the calculations we were still exceeding the permitted emission limits when we calculated yearly limits.  I dont know if Solar might have sold us a bill of goods but based upon emisisons calculations, the unit cant stay under the emissions guarantees that Solar promised.   We have notified the state of Colorado, as the permit requires and Im sure they will be following up on this.   Let me know what Solar says....... Team San-Juan-LaPlata 01/24/2001 11:08 AM 
Rick, the A-102 unit at LaPlata is at a point, using calculated rolling averages, that it is exceeding the tons per year emissions level of NOX, CO, and VOC. If we continue to run at these points it could mean an NOV. The numbers that we used on the permit are the guranteed emission numbers from Solar Turbines (per Larry Campbell). We were wondering if you could approach Leon O'Brien and/or Ernie Roberts on what Solar could do to remedy this problem. We feel that a communication coming from you and Rich might carry a little more weight then the LaPlata Gang could muster. Larry Campbell suggested that we try to remedy this through Solar Turbines first, before we pursue other avenues. Let us know if we can help in any way.                       Tnanks, Terry

Ed the 6"" project you are talking about is a small project independant of Rogas where a 6""line will be constructed from North Coles and run above ground, if possible, to a tie in approx. 1 mile away.  We will need a waiver for this.  There  wont be any by pass crossing concerns and  only ocal notifications due to the efforts to run the pipe above ground.  The reason for constructing above ground is to minimize surface disturbance.  Im sure that one of the conditions of the approval for this construction actiivty is that EOTT wil be required to maintain integrity of the pipeline to ensure no releases.....inspections, reporting etc....  Ill keep you in the loop on this..... 
John, I had asked Randi to complete an annual report for the F&G 2081 permit, as I did not want to have this hang over our head when EOTT's 2081 application was reviewed.  This may be the annual report that were talking about.  As you remember, the 2081 requires an annual report for activities conducted for the prior year and it is due by Jan 10th of every year.  It was not been submitted for 1999 or  2000.  Because Randi has been personally involved in all construction activities at the North Coles Levee facility, I thought she would be the prime person to complie the reports for us and then we would submit.  If this is the annual report everyone is talking about, then, yes, I instructed her to do these, primarily, because she has been involved since the get go and she has the information.  She has also promised the reports to me by 2/15 for sumibttal to the F&G. John Shafer 02/05/2001 04:09 PM 
What would it hurt to ask her?  Primarily she is working under your direction now as you implement various work through Scott Jones.  John Larry Campbell 02/05/2001 03:43 PM 
John, it s my understanding that Randi did only biology issues related to construction and monitoring.  I was not aware of Gary giving her permission to do waste surveys for the company.  Do you want me to ask her about this? One of the issues  that most people had with Gary was that he employed every contractor in California to do his work.  It may be that he had Randi working on this, I really dont know..... John Shafer 02/05/2001 11:22 AM 
Larry, Does this meet with your understanding of what Randi is doing?  Are we all on the same page?  John 
John, As per your request I contacted Randy McCormick (Bio Resources Consulting) on the annual reports that are due. Randy informed me that she had previously done a draft-report for 1999, which she had given to Gary Fuller. She also told me that she believed that Gary had not finalized nor turned in this report. Randy has committed to providing us with a 2000 Draft-Annual Report within two weeks for our review. I will inform you when I receive the draft report. Thanks, Scott If you need to contact Randy directly, you can reach her at: OFF:  (661) 589-4065 CELL:  (661) 619-0372 [mailto:Larry.Campbell@enron.com]

Plug this into the bottom of Page 2 of Attachment 1, which is our response to #19 of the Project Questionnaire.  Also, you might consider inserting this into the cover letter just to drive the point home that we have CESA/FESA coverage under existing agreements. EOTT presently holds a Memorandum of Understanding (M.O.U. No. 2081-1997-97-4) with the California Dept. of Fish and Game pursuant to incidental take of species listed under the California Endangered Species Act (CSA) Section 2081.  This M.O.U. applies to operations (including pipeline activities) related to the North Coles Levee Fractionator Plant and the Rogas rail facility.  EOTT has also reached agreement with Kern Water Bank Authority (KWBA) to use their Section 10 (a) (1) (b) permit for incidental take of species listed under the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA). Also, I spoke with Ed Purcell of Helt Engineering regarding the cross sections showing a trench depth of 7'.  He said he will modify the drawings and e-mail upon completion.  We should probably make note of this pending change somewhere in our materials (see item #8 on Pg 2 of Attachment 1). 
John, this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the  7 mile pipeline construction Rogas Project with respect to environmental  permitting and approvals. The following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies: California fish and game 1603 application Kern County Floodplain Management Agency-encroachment application US COE 404 Nationwide permit- preconstruction notification Reclamation Board- encroachment application Califonia State Fire Marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline Office of Pipeline Safety-waiver to Install aboveground pipeline I am checking to see what state requirements there are for SHPO clearances for this project.  I would suspect that they would  want us to do a field survey prior to construction.  It seems that every Califonia state and county agency is a candidate for notification or approval.   Ill keep you 
On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows: 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 2-10.84 drip locations The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000. I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes to 36"". One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were found at regulated levels..... 
John, I have attached the site characteristics for the 4 locations in Az. where Transwestern plans to install the four RB211's.  With this information please provide emissions quarantees for each location (sta. 1-4).  We will use the same gas quality for each location.  I have a meeting with the agency on the 26th of Feb. and would greaatly appreciate the guarantees prior to this date.  If possible, I am going to try and permit each site for 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the 25 ppm NOx number, so I would appreciate your assistance in this also.

John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure. 
I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico (ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo. The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, and send the results to POEP for review. With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different. The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
Bill,  the baseline noise surveys, which have been completed, were performed by Hoover and Keith out of Houston, Tx.  I have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting for the two C/S on state lands.  Ive dealt with these individuals before, but the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on that.  After that meeting, I will decide who should do the applications.  I have  calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the two locations on the Navajo lands.  Pending the outcome of each  meeting, I will decide who to use.  Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits and Indian lands permits, and they would probably be my first choice. I am keeping Mr. Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for Arizona.  One thing that I shold mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project. He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks.  Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units, which will be permitted for a six month period, there will still be an overall  major emissions decrease.  After the six month period, the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again.    Also, my intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25 ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the Northern Border system.  If this was a new station, I probably wouldnt be allowed to use the 45 number, but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine, this should be easy to do.  The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can do, but has had trouble reaching.  One thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations.  By permitting at 45 ppm, this will greatly help this.     Ill share the emissions numbers with you, when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions info I have from the existing units. I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F-1 document for the FERC submittal, and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the report.  Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation, the F-1 report will be completed by March 1. Is there something Ive missed? William Kendrick 02/19/2001 04:44 AM 
Larry-- Who will be the air permit management team, consultants and internal. Bill Larry Campbell 02/15/2001 09:25 AM 
Thanks John, I was assisted by the reg floks in Omaha and Earl Chanley about who the PM was.  In anticipation of the fast track nature of this project (nowadays everything seems to be of this sort)  the noise surveys for the FERC application have been completed at each station, the F-1 document for the is in preparation for the turbine installations, and I have a meeting with the state of Arizona on the 26th to go over permitting issues relevant to the air applications for C/S 1 and 2.   I  have contacted Region IX EPA about discussing the permitting for the two stations on Navajo lands, but have not heard from them.  We're on our way........ John Shafer 02/14/2001 07:07 PM 
This what's happening.  John 
Kathy, Please set up a conference call (possibly Thursday of this week) with the above referenced folks to discuss this issue in Larry's email.  Anyway, as soon as we can all be on the telephone at the same time will do.  John Larry Campbell 02/16/2001 09:56 AM

John, Scott Jones, I believe is still on vacation in Hawaii of all places. And I believe you are correct that we have around 15 acres of existing credit.  Kenny, let me know what you want me to do in this. John.Shafer@enron.com on 02/21/2001 06:50:22 AM 
Kenny and Scott, I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed ""good news"" and EOTT must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation as promptly as possible. It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do, that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit. Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer Edward_Attanasio@eott.com on 02/20/2001 07:49:31 PM 
Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our project ""for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank,"" and authorizing the Water Bank ""to extend their incidental take authority to you and your entire project under their Master Permit.""  This is, of course, very good news. The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank. Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased. While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only slows things down -- or worse. My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased. As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed. Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot. --ETA 
This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.  Construction activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, buildings, electrical poles etc.  The state and federal agencies take a very dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to approval.  This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing construction of the proposed activity.  Your assistance in this compliance issue will be greatly apprecaited.   Data generation and agency consultations are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.  Should you need 
Thanx, George.  Please let us know what their initial reaction and evaluation is of the conditions at Sta. 6.  Im interested in what their thoughts are with respect to the remediation of  the sandstone fractures and movement of condensate with PCB's.. George Robinson 02/21/2001 01:46 PM 
Larry, I contacted Norm Moreno at the POEP this afternoon. He said that he would contact Ed Steadman, Associate Director at the EERC, and pass along my name and number so that Ed could contact me. Norm said that he would prefer to do it this way rather than to have us initiate the first contact. The other day I found the web site for the research center (www.eerc.und.nodak.edu). 
Rich, thanx for the sampling update.  Ill pass it along to the apropriate parties.  A cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and down, as expected, with no glaring increases.  Anything urgent we need to discuss? 
I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between Southwest Gas and SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this tuesday.  I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB quarterly management conference call  that Transwestern has with SoCal to discuss PCB related invoices.  As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe) in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline. I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide input for that as well from an LDC standpoint. I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned about compliance with the PCB regulations.  Ralph said he will let me know 
Arnold, I think I will pass on the meeting.  Please apprise me of anything I may need to know from the meeting.  To bring you up to date on the environmental events of the turbine approvals in Arizona,  I received the rough draft of the baseline noise survey and you were copied.  As discussed, we should address changes to the documents as the contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not valid or representative of what we would like to do or not do.  I was contacted by the Navajo Nation and they have requested that we do onsite surveys at the C/S on the reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  I have contacted a contractor and they will be on site to do the surveys at both stations.  I am planning on having the entire C/S facility surveyed at both locations as there has not been a pin point location established as yet for all the construction and ground disturbance which will take place.  In the event there might be changes after the survey is completed, surveying the entire facility will keep us from having the new distrubance areas surveyed after the original survey was completed.  The F-1 environmental document for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by this friday.   The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   I have a meeting with EPA in San Francisco to discuss permitting the C/S facilities on the reservation on 3/20.  Im going to try and move this meeting up if possible.  After the meeting, I should be able to have an application in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a week.  Based upon experience with the state of Arizona, EPA and the Navajo Nation, expect permit approval within 5-7 months after submittal of the application. 
entirely your option......we can tie you in if you want.   This is mostly a review of their quotation and to get a firm production schedule. Larry Campbell@ENRON 03/05/2001 12:25 PM 
Arnold, do you want me in on this meeting? 
We plan to meet with RR on Monday 3/12 
Dear Arnold: Thanks for your time today. This note is to confirm my understanding of our discussion: 1- Our John March  is to receive some additional operating points next week.  John will also receive advice about the CO requirement at part load.  John will then run compressor and GT performance data at those points.  He will indicate our method for achieving the CO requirement at the specified points, as well as, at other part  loads. 2- Furthermore,  John will advise our method of ensuring that the engine will not exceed the required CO concentration at part loads.   We may utilize a bleed system to achieve the required CO, and also a control algorithm that precludes the engine from dipping below a certain load level. 3-  Items 1 and 2, will be topics of a meeting to be held in Houston during Monday, 12-March.  Scope of supply, delivery committment, spare GG pricing, and RR hold of a spare PT will also be topics for the meeting. As a new point,  I'd like to confirm our interest in showing you how the 6761 will achieve your needs at the meeting in Houston. 
I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only last 3-4 hours. Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on. The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let 
Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last couple of weeks, but heres whats new: A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the Rogas project. The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet. Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary

This is a major plus for the project. The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in Az. was received.  Some changes will be made in each document.,  as the contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not valid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.  The Navajo Nation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on the reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  A contractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12. The F-1 environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by this friday. The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   A meeting with EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/S facilities on the reservation on 3/20.  After the meeting, applications should be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a week. Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of the application.  During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted to remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each location.  This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days, assuming no major issues result.  One interesting issue that might develop is 
Byron as per the Red Rock expansion conference call today presented below are the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility except Sta. 1 where they only have one auxillary unit. Sta. 1 1- Waukesha 350 Hp LRZ NOx 30.48 CO 121.94 VOC 1.31 Sta. 2  2- Waukeshas 350 Hp LRZ NOx 30.48 CO 121.94 VOC 1.31 Sta. 3 2-366 Hp PSVG Ingersol Rands NOx 35.35 CO 30.40 VOC .04 Sta. 4  2-450 Hp Waukeshas F3520 GU NOx 43.46 CO 37.38 
Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you know....... Kenny_Maltby@eott.com on 03/08/2001 02:13:39 PM 
We are going to start the Rogas project Monday 03/12/2001. The first 2500 ft leaving Rogas is across a carrot field that has been harvested and is not in any habitat. The farmer is due to start working the field the 24th so we need to get the pipe laid. The contractor is going to start with a reduced crew and expects to be finished crossing the initial 2500 ft by the end of the week. The following things must be accomplished early next week so we can continue construction. Checks received so we can purchase compensation credits from Kern Water Bank and Area. Be added to the KWB's Master Permit. That will happen when they receive there check. Insurance certificates in the hands of the Kern County Water Agency and West Kern Water. If the contractor has to stop we may be faced with additional mobilization and demobilization charges. 
Based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone cleaning of his section of the pipeline.  should cleaning occur of this section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.  Vector has been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning 
Terry, the entire facility has not been disturbed.  Only most of it.  Id say approx 70%.  The other 30% has been impacted but not tot the point of disturbing all the vegetation, just foot and vehicle traffic.  I dont have problem with saying the above, but keep in mind, the facility has been there and just because the trees havent been disturbed, doesnt mean that the understory beneath the trees has been pristine.   It has always been Transwetern's policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its locations, especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value (scenery wildlife etc).  I dont have a problem with including resource reports 3 and 7 for vegetation and soils.  I have received a verbal from the US Fish and Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or critical habitats.  In addition, the adjacent lands are of the same habitat types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore, would not be an issue of habitat loss.   There are not any old TW hands around to positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural encroachment of the trees into the area, I seriously doubt it.  Again, TW tried to mantain a postive presence at each site, but did utilize the sites for their intended purpose. In Arizona, we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater.  We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from the closest City (ie Flagstaff for station 2 construction) or from a drinking well source.  In any event, we will test the water prior to discharge and ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the ground.  I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe. If we need to discuss the above, give me a call ""Hackett, Terry"" <THackett@ENSR.com> on 03/09/2001 02:18:52 PM 
I spoke to John Nystedt, the contact person for the Navajo Nation F&W service concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal  surveys at the two C/S on reservation lands.  I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S sites for review.  Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.  However, because of the issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys. John has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are approved to do work on the reservation.  I have contacted a number of individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys 
I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB person with SoCal, concerning the SWG meeting about PBCs on the SWG system.  As mentioned in the last note, SWG has discovered PCBs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into their system.  SWG receives gas from SoCal and PGE at two separate and independent interconnects.  Liquids have been collected at the two interconnects from SoCal at concentrations of <500 and <100 ppm, 
Maria, as per your request, please see the attached data: All the below figures were calculated using the 4500 hp factor on the mainline ( TCV-12 Clark ) units and 450 hp on the ( 4520 Waukesha ) auxillary. Units 601, 602, and 603 are the mainline units. Unit 621 is the auxillary engine and runs back up power, if needed.  The year 1997 was figured by Kerry Welch who no longer is with us. 1998, 1999, and 2000 operating hours and fuel use numbers were calculated using the spread sheet that was provided by our mechanical analyst.

This is due to the fact that our narutal gas supply changed in 1997 to a more dry natural gas and therefore, there was no liquids associated with the gas. Again I apologize the inconsistency in the data.  We have had employee turnovers at the facility and different spreadsheets were used to provide the information to the EPA.  We are in the process of standardizing our data collections to eleminate this problem in the future.  I hope this information will help in the permit review process.  Again please accept my apologizes in the data collection errors. Okpala.Maria@epamail.epa.gov on 02/15/2001 01:50:35 PM

Guys, I received Harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements.  My question is, how does the fuel use compare with what Solar says the fuel use should be?  If we can get Solar to provide written guarantees and ""UP"" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the fuel value on the permit.  The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment.  From their eyes, this would be a strong indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some merit.  Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado. Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata? Then let me know.  If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another 
John, Bill this is the latest on the environmental issues for the turbines in Arizona.  The arch surveys at stations 3 and 4 on the Navajo reservation have been completed and nothing reportable was found or identified.  Each contractor is now preparing their reports and hopefully, will have them submitted to their mgt. for review in a couple of days and then issued to TW. The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 2 on Monday.  The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday. Preliminary quotes for the surveys are $4-5000.00 for both sites.  The original word from them was 7-10 prior to giving approval.   This was definatley a plus. Still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what turbine equipment is to be installed at each facility.  GE or Rolls Royce. Additionally, confirmed decisions have not been made as to what auxillary 
I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline activities will not disrupt the site. I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be 
Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.  As you may remember, Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire facility near Ft. Stockton.  Groundwater montioring activities have been ongoing since aprox. 1988.  A permit condition states that if three years of groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be terminated.  A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received on July 14, 1999. Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....). Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.  I anticipate that we will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site 
Rich, I agree with  your concern.  The entire Arizona mainline is a potential concern for carrying PCB's into California.  We have verification of this from the last cleaning we did on the San Juan lateral where liquids got past the Gallup C/S scrubbers and PG&E and SoCal both reported elevated liquids in their systems. Analytical results of these liquids in California showed PCB's at regulated levels (ie greater than 50 ppm). Rich Jolly 04/03/2001 07:52 AM 
Gary we won't be able to do any of this cleaning until we get sufficient scrubbers at these locations. One thing we can't afford to do this time is take a chance of moving any PCB'S further West. There are new scrubbers planned for the West locations in the future. Thanks RIch GARY CHOQUETTE 04/03/2001 07:31 AM 
Ben, Ken and I have looked over my tuned TW West mainline model and feel the next area we should target for aggressive cleaning and/or drag reducer is between stations 2 & 3.  This section is sufficiently far away from California that PCB issues should be mitigated.  It has the highest relative roughness (excluding Gallup to Station 4, which appears to be mostly SCADA calibration errors).  Station 3 has more HP than the other stations and therefore more likely to achieve MAOP.  The higher HP and reduced pipeline losses will translate to a significantly higher pressure at the discharge of station 2. By my estimation, we will gain 5 MMBTU/D in total system capacity if we reduce the effective roughness of this one section from 0.00077 to 0.00058. 
The Title V air permit applications for C/S's 3 and 4 were submitted to Region IX EPA in San Francisco.  These were the last two applications to be filed for the Redrock Mainline Exspansion project in Arizona. Assistance was given to all field teams in Arizona in the preparation and submittal of the required annual complaince certifications required under each facilities Title V Operating Permit. 2000 emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the eleven C/S in the Midland Region. A revised APEN was submitted to the state of Colorado for the forthcoming 
Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility. You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.  This letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.  Id like to send this out on Friday or Monday. 
A 2:00 pm central  time conference call has been scheduled to discuss the most recent PCB analytical results for the Topock Lateral.  Your attendance is requested.   The dial in number is   877-795-3687.  Access code is 
David, nice touch with the NC.  I sure John will have some ideas on how to best to get this thing going after the NC gets back with you.  Ill leave it up to Mr. Shafer as to his preference to have dinner with Mr. Smith during our June tour of the C/S facilities.  Good to hear that the team  has bought in on supporting the NC by participation.  If you want me to, I can put on a little presentation to the other 2 teams in Arizona and see if we can get their support and participation also.  Let me know and we can do this at one of their safety meetings....... David Roensch 04/17/2001 11:13 PM 
Larry, per your request following our phone conversation today I'm forwading a brief note regarding our dinner meeting last night with the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Hank Hull (Flagstaff Team leader) and I met with Edward Smith, the Northern Arizona Program Ecologist with the Nature Conservancy, here out of Flagstaff.  The purpose of the meeting was to make introductions between Ed and Hank and to informally discuss opportunities in which the Flagstaff Team could support the local chapter.  The Flagstaff Team made a committment in their Team Objectives and each team member in their Peer Committments to support the Conservancy in some manner this year.  To date all eight of the Flagstaff Team members (2 positions currently vacant) have taken advantage of the free membership offered through ETS.  Also, Ed was quite impressed with ETS's sponsorship of the employee and family memberships.  I won't get into the details but, it was obvious that opportunities will exist for the Team to become active in local activities.  So, as a follow up to the meeting, Ed will make a list of the areas and locations the Conservancy is in need of help and forward this list to Hank who will then poll the various Team members and solicit volunteers.  This may take a couple of weeks to get up and running but we should be well on our way by June.  Our goal, for now, will be to committ on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis to providing a given number of volunteer hours.  I'll keep you posted on how things progress. Ed also, offered to come out to one of the Team's meetings and give the group an overview of the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and discuss our involvement with the entire Team.  And last but not least, when you, Bill, John, Rich and Randy come out for your West End field trip we may be able to coordinate a dinner get togeather with Ed to discuss any topics of interest. Just a thought..... Have a good week....... 
Kermit Team, I received a letter from the TNRCC concerning emissions fees that have not been paid for a facility called the ""Hendrick/Wink Tank Farm"". The letter was addressed to a Mr. Paul Newman of EOTT.  The letter stated that we may owe emissions fees for the facility.  My question is, do you have such a facility in your team area, and what does it comprise?  ie..number and size of tanks, throughput in 2000.  The TNRCC letter was dated March 28, 2001 and we are required  to provide information to them within 30 days.  I just received the letter today.  HELP!!  I need something from you by this 
Kermit Team, I really need your assistance on this.  I received a notice from the TNRCC about the above facility.  Apparently, the emissions fees for the facility have not been paid for 2000.  In light of this, does this facility exist in your area of responsibility?  Please let me know.  If so, I need the follwoing information ASAP to aviod an NOV for the facility. Size of each tank height and capacity Number of tanks Color of tank(s)  and roof(s) fixed or floating roof if floating, internal or external primary or secondary seals how is tank loaded and or unloaded ie trucks, pipeline etc... Relative vapor pressure if known monthly throughput maximum fill rate of tank 
Alison, have you found out anything about the above referenced?  The deadline for submitting the FY 2001 emissions fee is April 30.  The TNRCC can levee a fine on the facility if we dont provide them with some informaiton pretty 
Alison, better send me what you have via fed-x or fax (505) 627-8172.  I have spoken to Bill about this.  We need to send a check to the agency to cover ourselves prior to the April 30 deadline. I beleive that EOTT is responsible for paying the fee.  I have left a message with Larry Fensted and  his associate Ruth Ann and expressed the need for the $416.00 check by 4/1.

I am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which I am receiving.  I have been requested by Louis Soldano, Enron attorney for the Gas Pipeline Group, to apprise you of this situation.  The content of materials received, I consider offensive, and am sure it would also be considered objectionable and innappropriate by the standards of Enron Corporation.   Please be advised, that many times it is  difficult to screen this material based upon the headings and titles that accompany the contents.  Consequently, innappropriate materials such as this are opened.  I have accidently opened two such e mails by mistake and have received the ""Enron warning""  that my name and mailbox will be or may be audited in the future and that my name has been placed in a file.    Because of this, I am extremely uncomfortable about future accidents occuring and more importantly, about the increased frequency and accessability of my e mail box to trash and questionable materials. I would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter.  Thank you very 
Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year. All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical assets which were reviewed. Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the following: Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee payments were documented NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks were documented Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date SARA compliance and reporting had been completed SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112 Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were available for review There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site included in the asset for sale (permits for the remediation activity is in place) Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were documented Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files. Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased. 
On behalf of EOTT, an environmental records review was completed for a block of Koch crude oil pipeline assets located in south Texas.  There were no issues or environmental deficiencies identified during the review.  A due diligence was recommended to verify confirmation of the housekeeping activities presented in the records review. The air permit modification for the La Plata C/S was received from the state of Colorado.  This modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use as a result of  a change in gas quality supplies in the San Juan basin.

Randy, based upon the records review, this is the only issue that may be a= =20 problem.  If a tank has been moved to another location, it would trigger=20 requirements which were enacted on the date of the relocation.  For instanc= e,=20 if a tank constructed prior to 1973 was moved in 1978, there would be=20 emissions control requirements placed on the tank as required by the 1978= =20 tank regulations.  If the tank had remained at its original location, it=20 would be grandfathered with respect to emissions.  However, because the tan= k=20 was relocated, it is looked upon as being a tank constructed in 1978 and=20 subject to the 1978 regulations and is no longer grandfathered. I was not given this information during the records review, so I dont know = if=20 any of the tanks apply.  If any of the tanks fit into the above scenerio,= =20 EOTT or Koch will be  looking at some major $$$$$ to bring any subject tank= =20 into compliance.  Generally speaking, the regualtions and costs to comply= =20 increase as a function of date.   =20 1. Q. Of the tanks listed on the spreadsheet, have any of the tanks been=20 relocated from its original construction locations?  List the tank, date=20 moved and   location moved to. A.

Scott, I have sent out twice a request to each of the field teams in the Midland Region to provide some desperately needed tank information to determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland area. So far, only the Midland, Lovington, Kermit, Andrews, Hobbs and Jal teams have responded. I would appreciate your assistance in motivating the remaining seven teams to get this information to me at their earliest convenience.  I have attached the most recent update of the tank spreadsheet for you to pass on to the teams. Thanks for the help. 
Hazardous waste fees were submitted to the state of Arizona. Emissions fees were submitted to the state of New Mexico For C/S's 7,8,9, Atoka No. 3 and Bloomfield.

To meet the requirements of 2 gms for NOx, a catalytic converter has been installed on the replacement unit. 
Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at the Bakersfield Fractionator.  The scheduled completion date for six of the items is 6/30.  I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during the audit.  Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items show up as deliquent in his region.  Whatever you can do to assist us in either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would 
Ed, I would appreciate it very much if you would review the action item list from Scott Jones and choose which items are Koch's responsibility and which items  belong to EOTT, and let Scott and I know.  Ill contact Scott and have him send you the action item list for your review.  As I had previously mentioned, Scott and I have until 6/30 to complete the subsurface investigations and knowing which items are EOTT's and which are Koch's would greatly help us.  As Scott's server is down, Ill phone him and have him send you the action item list.  Again Thanks very much. 
Under the regulations of the state of Arizona, facilities which have a pollution prevention plan (sta.1, sta. 2 and Needles) are required to have an annual training to evaluate pollution prevention activiies.  I have scheduled with the above three facilities to have pollution training on the following dates: Kingman team June 21 Flagstaff team June 22 This training is to be completed by July 1 of every year.  This training will last for approximately 2-3 hours.  Employees that works at any of the three facilities are required to be present for the training.  Your participation 
Lorraine, Ill give you a call this afternoon.  By the way, did they test the liquids for PCBs?  I havent heard from the Gallup team on whether they have gone and checked for collected liquids at their I/C's.  Rick, can youcheck on this for me? 
Louie, after the presentation MIchael gave, there were some issues about the data and predictions ie., like how much solvent do we really need to clean the pipeline and the injection intervals and locations, but not whether the solvent or technology would or would not work.  The data did show that terpenoline does remove PCB's from pipeline.  But because Penn State was so deeply involved in the modeling study, and we were still under the PG&E thumb, it appeared to be in the best interest of TW to see it to the end. There wasnt anyone who had any better suggestions or ideas.  The thought was that because of the amount of $$$$$$ we had previously spent, not to see it through would have meant 0 return  for the money we had invested.    And if it works, the money would have been wisely used. The real truth of course is when we do a trial run.  I signed a six month extension to the contract for Penn State (I sent out a memo on this) but not for additional $$$$$$.  They needed the extra time to complete the modeling study and data evaluation.  Last summer/fall, Tiny had been overseeing the operational side of this (ie terpenoline storage locations and coordinating injection points and the pigging activities).  When the decision is made to begin the injections and pigging, Tiny will be ready  and waiting...... 
If you have seen my notebook please return it.  There is personal account info. in it. I am offering a reward. 
Bill you may want to sit in on this if you have time.  It seems we have items of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at Bakersfield which were tied into  a previous agreement with Koch for which the action team did not know when the action items were prepared.  The action dates are approaching and   Scott and I are having a hard time getting clearification on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the responsibility of Koch for some of the items.  Ed, the attorney for EOTT, will be requested by Lou, to notify Koch concerning their responsiblity.  If this sounds convoluted, then you know as much as I..... 
Laguna and or Moutainair team, because I dont know which team is responsible for the Belen delivery point, would someone check on liquids at this location and if present, collect a sample and have it analyzed for PCB's?  We're required to do this by the contract.  If no liquids are present, drop Lorraine and or myself a message  stating such.  Thanx 
Bill, any delays on this project are NOT from the env. matrix.  I received the matrix from the team sometime last week (tuesday -thursday) when I was out of town on business.  When I came back on friday, I completed the matrix and sent it back to the team.  Any delays on this issue are from the team, not from me.  As I remember the project, it involved work on the right of way and therefore was covered by the blankets we have for SHPO and F&W.  There were no project delays in terms of permits or approvals...... William.Kendrick.enronXgate@enron.com on 05/20/2001 08:12:13 AM 
The environmental clearances are still in effect as long as we stay on our right of way and in our measuring station yard.  For any construction work at the PG&E station, we will need written aprpoval from PG&E.  I  will notify the state and county of California when we do the construction work.  Earl, I will need to know the amount  of natural gas which will be released during the blowdown of the 1850 feet of pipe, our separator and meter tubes.  Pg&E will be responsible for the notification of gas release for their separator and piping.... David Roensch 08/07/99 10:44 PM 
The following is the update I received from the Kingman Team on todays pigging activities: Tiny, We kicked two pigs today with 55 gals of diesel in front of each pig.  On the first run we got only enough liquid to get a sample.  The pig came out with a big chunk out of it.  Don't know what is causing this because we have received a couple of pigs that were damaged.  This is only the second pig that has come in that we cannot use again. When the second pig came in, we received 41 gals of liquid.  We had to haul it out a pail at a time.  We pulled about half from the seperator and half from the drain tap in front of the seperator. These two runs took us nine hours to run, that is why we only did two.  We plan on putting in 100 gals of diesel tomarrow since they are going to ship some more diesel for us on Monday.  If flow rate permitting we plan on kicking two more pigs tomarrow with 100 gals each. Brent  & Russ Per this evenings discussions with Gas Control, it looks like we will have 60 mmcfd scheduled to PG&E for tomorrows (Sundays) gas day.  Gas Control will make every effort to coordinate flows with PG&E and insure we have higher flowing volumes during the pigging hours if at all possible.  Again the new pigs are due to be on site by Tuesday.   I forwarded an e:mail message to Kingman informing them to insure they split a sample with PG&E on the 15 MP sample point. I've set up a conf. call for this Friday the 13th at 10:00 am Houston time. We should have additional sampling infromation by this time not only from the Weekly Report but on the pigging activites as well.  (877-795-3687   pin 323297) My comments on information communicated to Boschee are shown below. 
Hope you had a better flight home than me - late one hour departing, flew to Omaha and circled because of lightning and thunderstorms until we had to go to Kansas City for fuel, then back to Omaha to sneak in between lightning bolts - the drive home was a combination of being blinded by lightning, unable to see because of driving rain, or praying the car could make it through the flooded streets! Anyway, home by 1:15 AM, so not too bad. Here's what I believe to be our current plan, which will be communicated to PG&E through letter to Rod Boschee. 1.  Continue to inject diesel at a 55 gal rate and pig daily through 8/15 We will be running from 2 to 4 pigs daily (depending on flow rates) and injecting 100 gallon per pig run.  Today (Saturday) was the exception because of flow rates and the volume of diesel on hand (400 gn's).  Two pigs were run at 55 gallons of diesel per pig.  This 400 gallons under the previous pigging schedule would have lasted for 1 1/2 weeks at the single pig per day & at 55 gallons per pig.  A load of diesel will be on location Monday. 2.  Collect liquids from all pig runs for analysis and trending (daily or as often as pigs are received) 3.  Collect liquids from TW's filter / separator for analysis and trending (daily) This is above and beyond the weekly accumulation and split sampling at this point.  The Weekly Split sampling will still continue. 4.  After 8/15, continue pigging daily w/o injection of any liquids to dry pipe through 9/7 5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above 6. Schedule Vector to be on site September 7 to decontaminate a.) 1850' of pipe from TW's measurement to PG&E's filter/separator and b.)  PG&E's filter/separator. Larry/Earl - We're still OK on clearances for ROW and excavation etc... should we need to make a cut into the 1850' of pipe aren't we?  I'm assuming the clearances we received for the siphon project would carry forward???? 7. Post 5 day outage for scheduled pipeline maintenance on EBB as soon as Vector confirms date. 8. Trending and analysis will determine if any pigging or further decon work will be done on TW's upstream pipe. Please review, add, subtract, correct, etc. prior to Monday. Thanks for continuing help - this is going to be a very tough win, if a win is possible. Mike 
After reveiwing the documents entitled, ""Baseline Environmental Investigation of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California"" and ""Report of Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area Tupman, California"", it appears that the following areas should be investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of identified contamination from the above referenced reports: Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons Wash rack area- lead Propane comp. area lead total petroleum hydrocarbons chromates Cooling tower area- chromates Compressor area- BTEX chromates lead In the ""Baseline Environmental Investigation"" report, sampling was only conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989 document in the ""Baseline"" report for specific parameters, but there may have been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or the loading rack issues. One last issue.  As you know, identification of contamination is usually accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of processes and or history.  Report results of the surface contamination do not show there to be an immediate environmental concern.  Due to the age of the facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports. However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the facility. 
OK Ed try this: Tank 15 area-  Total petroleum hydrocarbons TPH concentrations in soil exceed 10,000 mg/kg.  This value has been identified in the ""Leaking Underground Fuel Tank Field Manual, (State of Califonia, 1989).  This value was identified as a         potential threat to groundwater aquifers.

I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the trees which are flagged. As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the PCB pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from you identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project. 
Byron/Tiny, I spoke to Ken Jacobs with the Forest Service and have attached his e mail below concerning the Forest Sevice's choice for the building.  I have informed him that our new piping and ancillary equipment will remain white which is consistent with the existing equipment.  He had no problems with this.  I also had asked him if there was a name for the brown which the FS uses on their signs and he did not know of a specific name, so I think the best thing would be to match as closely as possible. The Forest Service would like the new Compressor Building to be painted dark brown.  The color should be close to the color that we use for our signs.  Call me at 520-214-2464 if you would like to discuss this. Ken Jacobs Lands Staff Officer Ranger District Coconino National Forest Byron Rance@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/22/2001 08:35 AM 
David. Need to know the current color scheme for TW for the new buildings. Think its white wall and roof with blue trim. Do we have to hide anything at any of the sights behind desert tan. Please advise. Byron 
Michael, I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about the status of the study.  When will your progress report be ready for review?  It might be a good idea to let us review your report and then we can make comments and recommendations based upon your findings.  Im glad that things are going well with your data and that we may be able to apply something positive towards our situation.  Thanks for getting back with me.

Presented Title V training to the Flagstaff Team.  The training included responsibilities, recordkeeping and semi annual reporting requirements. A meeting was held with representatives of Transwestern and PG&E to discuss activities related to removing PCB's from the Topock Lateral.  Sampling data was reviewed and discussions were held addressing past cleaning efforts. PG&E has stated by letter and verbally that natural gas volumes will be decreased weekly until PCB concentrations fall below 5 ppm.  Transwestern will be implementing a pipeline cleaning of the remaining 1850 of pipe between our M/S and the PG&E C/S.  Included in this cleaning will be decontamination of the additional filter separators and meter runs. Assisted in the compilation and data gathering of the Title V compliance monitoring and annual certification reports for C/S No. 5, Thoreau. The annual blanket request for the Arizona SHPO was submtted for renewal. Notification letters were submitted to the state of New Mexico notifiying the agency of like for like replacements of recipricating engines at the AToka No. 1 C/S.  Additional notifications were submitted to the agency apprising them of engine removal activities at C/S's No. 5 and 9 which would impact 
Bob, James, Roger, Im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the Midland Region in completing the attached EOTT tank spreadsheet.  Ive heard from some of the teams but nothing from others.  Im under the gun as to finding  out where the MIdland Region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the only way I can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed onto the spreadsheet.  This is where the teams assistance is required.  I have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will deliver it to the following teams for their valued input: Monahans Team Hamlin/Haskel Team Lamesa Team Big Lake Team Midland Team Eunice Team

Attended the interim team review process and meeting in Houston. Met with the New Mexico Regional Director of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.  Picked up materials to be presented at the Southwest cross functional training meeting in Albuq. next week. Delivered and presented the Work Plan for the Station 9 soil rememdiation to 
Randy, I need your assistance with something.  Im trying to determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil storage tanks in the Midland Region. Bill told me that you have a spreadsheet of the EOTT tanks showing some of the tank characteristics (size, storage, date of installation, state etc). Whatever you have, I would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me.  E mail works best for me. Thanks again. If you send this to me, I promise to let you out fish me like you did in 
Attended the Southwestern Region cross funcitional training meeting in Albuquerque.  Gave a presentation to team leaders on the Transwestern system about the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and partnership opportunities and employee participation . Attended the Navajo Nation training session for newly adopted regualtions for public water systems on the Navajo Nation.  Transwestern has 3 facilites which are public water systems on the Nation.  The new regualtions will be taken back to each location and immediately implemented. A presentation was given to the MIdland Region about  monthly R-3 condensate reports which are required to be submitted to the Railroad Commission.  The status of the field teams participation in the completion of the EOTT tank 
Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management. They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the Foundations new CEO........ Ivan.Hamilton.enronXgate@enron.com on 06/12/2001 09:03:46 AM 
Eunice team,  The NNG Eunice C/S is required to prepare and submit the semi annual and annual reports required by the facilities Title V Operating Permit which was issued by the State of New Mexico.  The reports are required to be submitted to the state of New Mexico and the EPA by July 19, 2001.   These reports are required even though the facility is not in operation.  If you would like assistance in the preparation and submittal of each document, give me a call and we can set up a time to meet at the C/S to do each report. 
John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress. Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can ""advertise"" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the Foundation. Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification report submittals. Presented annual pollution prevention training for the Kingman and Flagstaff teams as required by the State of Arizona for large quantity generators of hazardous waste. Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components (inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to 
Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion. In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple cycle. Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing. Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to discuss the issue with Arco. 
I dont know if you guys are doing this, but a requirement to your air permit states that the facility is to report the number of hours of operation each year to the Air Quality Bureau for the Catepillar generator.  The report is to be submitted by January 31st of each year.  If we need to discuss this, 
The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity generators of hazardous waste in Arizona. Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico. A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue. Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine

Participated in the compliation and submittal of the Title V semi annual monitoring and annual certification reports for the NNG Eunice C/S. Data gathering and correspondance continues with the third party lawyer for the NOV issue at the P-1 C/S.  This involved a like for like replacement of a turbine in New Mexico. Annual blanket renewal requests were submitted to the Texas SHPO and the Arizona F&W. A permit be rule has been submitted to the TNRCC for the like for like I/C engine replacement at the NNG Reagan Co 2 C/S. The EOTT tank database is 90% complete.  Field verification with each team will begin to determine  compliance with recordkeeping, fees, NSPS and air permit status.  Air permits for the EOTT facilities in New Mexico were copied from the  agencies records.  Compliance status will be determined for these 
John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E: 1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E interconnect/delivery/receipt points?  Future thoughts/plans for additional separator installations. 2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their equipment.  Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs? 3. Internal sampling activities.  How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E system.  (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be nice   depicting this. 4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort to  show our commitment. John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters. If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is $$$$$$$, although they do a good job. Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you plan on asking him to attend the meeting........ 
In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance: Hobbs team  August 6 8:00 am Lovington team  August 7 8:00 am Jal team  August 8 8:00 am Eunice team  August 9 8:00 am I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.  Your patience and assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.  If a 
I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future. In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list. 
John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel. I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E? As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue up in Flagstaff. Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.  Thanks for your guidance and thoughts. 
A meeting was held with the third party attorney who is providing assistance with the recently issued NOV for the P-1 C/S over a like for like turbine exchange which occurred in 1996.  A history was given of the incidents which led up to the NOV being issued and results of the meeting which Transwestern had with the AQB in 1996 which lead Transwestern to believe that issue had been resolved. The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted to each generator of PCBs on the Transwestern system. Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases  to the TNRCC.  The agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.  An incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near MIdland led to this emergency training being given.  Based upon a phone call with Region 7 of the TNRCC, the agency stated that they will be issuing NOV's to facilities that submit incomplete ""Upset/Maintenance NOtification Forms for

I just spoke to the state of Arizona concerning the tree removal at Station 2.  Their response to our request to remove the trees has been APPROVED, provided that this is the only pre activity  we do prior to receiving the air permit.  This means that no other  construction or preparation activities can be performed  or conducted untill the air permit has been issued.   This approval also includes stump removal if need be...... 
Sta.3, 4 and 5 As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta. 3,4 and 5.  Jeff Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample collections at  each of the three compressor station and has three months completed.  This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor station. Stations 3 and 4:   each months reports are to be sent to the following 2 agencies: Navajo Nation EPA P.O. Box 339 Window Rock, AZ 86515 Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager US EPA    Region IX 75 Hawthorne Street San Francisco, CA 94105 Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6) Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also. I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station 4 and 5 reports to station 5. The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022.. 
The Air Quality Bureau conducted an agency inspection of C/S's 7 Mountainair and 8 Corona.  There were no deficiencies or items of concern identified by the inspector. Facility records were copied from the Air Quality Bureas files in Santa Fe for the P-1 C/S. The excess emissions semiannual report as required under NSPS for turbines was submitted for the Bloomfield C/S. A custom fuel monitoring schedule  reqeust was submitted to Region VI EPA for the NNG Plains turbine C/S. Emissions fees were submitted for Laguna C/S. A meeting will be held with the vice president of development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation to begin preparation of a MOU between Enron and the Foundation.  The meeting will be held in Albuq. during the 1st or 3rd week in 
Advisors, presented below is a memo from GPG Houston requesting that we provide to them the number of ETS employees in each team who have taken advantage of the one year free membership with The Nature Conservancy. Apparently there is some concern that employees are not taking advantage of the opportunity which has been provided for them to get involved with an organization that has some benefit towards wildlife and habitat preservation and enhancement.  Should an employee desire to sign up for the one year free memebership, the Conservancy the web address is www.tnc.org.  You can click the button that says ""Become a member"" and sign up for the annual membership at that time.  At the request of Mr. John Shafer, please provide to me a total by  team of the number of individuals which have signed up with the Nature Conservancy by the end of the month. Your assistance in this is greatly appreciated 
Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from David Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area. Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservation Office and the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there  appears to be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this project and we would  like to take a more proactive approach  ""up front"" with regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.  Its hard to deal with public issues when construction is underway. As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaff to Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once the pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be completed for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, archeology surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should this portion of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC will require an EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report to be conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issues but also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this greatly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we can identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure. However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline environmental work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys identify something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at this time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly assist in the environmental budgeting for this project. 
Kevin, as promised, attached is the information that was found by David Roensch on environemntal perspectives in the Flagstaff area...... 
George, Dave Cobrain of the NMED has verbally approved of the soil characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the OCD.  I have not heard from Bill Olson of the OCD yet.  Dave was going to inform the OCD that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite 
Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix. The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona. I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful 
The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are 
The Southwest Region will be hosting its 2001 environmental roundtable in Albuquerque, NM on October 16-17 at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (505) 821-3333.  Room rates are $89.00 per night.  Each attendee will be responsible for his/her room reservations for the two day event.  The agenda for this roundtable will be sent out in the near future.  If you would like to be a speaker and give a presentation on a topic or product please send to my attention for possible incorporation into the program. In order to hold a sufficient block of rooms, provide adequate roundtable space and accomodations,  your reply is required to my attention via emal or 
As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential risk impact.  A rating of ""0"" indicates that there is no risk associated with this regulation or issue and a rating of ""3"" indicates a major problem or an issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or formally close each issue. Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of information presented. General Pipeline Characteristics ; This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small volumes of compressor oils are collected. All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future. The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). this is a non Title V major source. NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their underground storage capacity. NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the agencies. Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas. Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. Risk: 0  Cost: $0 Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices (<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved. Risk: 0  Cost: $0 PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected. Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown. Risk:  1  Cost: $0 Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment which may have been used. Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000 Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous waste. Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous waste. Risk: 0  Cost:  0 NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company. Risk:  1  Cost:  $500 Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure of this site is expected in the near future. Risk: 1  Cost: $500 LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas Plant. Risk: 0  Cost:  $0 Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks. Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately $94,000. Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000 Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature. Risk: 1   Cost: $0 Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park. The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts. NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this site. Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000 Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been identified as a contributing member to the contamination. Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956. During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in 1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds. Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance coverage  appears to be somewhat premature. Risk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000 
Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along with them.... Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues. Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from the EPA. 
The State of New Mexico conducted a surprise air inspection of the TW Atoka No.3 C/S.  The agency found no non compliance issues or violoations during the inspection. The second quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee meeting was held this week.  Transwestern's share of the PCB management and disposal activities on the SoCal system for the quarter was $125,950.00. The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  The original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years without resolution, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.   A conference call will be set up to discuss Transwestern's next course of action. The summary report for due diligence conducted in Portland Ore. was completed and submitted to Environmental Affairs in Houston. 
Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet. A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year. Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern. Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed project for Transwestern Pipeline Company. Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th NFL meeting in MIdland.

Particpated in the EPA NFL spill release and discharge data request for the Midland Region. A meeting was held with the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality Bureau concerning the NOV for the P-1 C/S.  Transwestern presented letters from the AQB to Transwestern which apparently had not been reviewed by the AQB prior to issuance of the NOV.  The AQB requested a delay to re evaluate the new evidence which had been given to them.  They indicated that they 
John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera to handle the panarama part of the equations.  In conversations with Doug Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you shortly after the trip... 
In light of the recent PCB issue with PG&E on the Topock Lateral,  I have asked Mr. John Woodyard of Roy F. Westin to c ome to Houston and make a presentation on PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  Mr. Woodyard has considerable experience in the management of PCB's and works closely in industry associations (INGAA and GRI),  Mr. Woodyard also works as a consultant in this capacity. The date of this meeting will be on Friday, September 3rd, beginning at 9:00 am.  Lou Soldano will be setting up a meeting room and will notifiy all attendees via lotus notes prior to the September 3rd meeting date. I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and 
NORTHERN NATURAL GAS Reviewed Title V Operating Permit renewal applications with field teams for Finney Co. 1, Finney Co. 3 and Fowler.  Contractor has made revisions and the permit applications will be overnighted to the State of Kansas for Monday, September 10, 2001 delivery. TRANSWESTERN EOTT Started EPA 308 Request response Tuesday, September 4, 2001 at Russell, Kansas and for EOTT releases in the Amarillo Region.  Large contingency of employees worked jointly to provide files on each release experienced since 1998.  DES had Title V Operating Permits due so environmental coordinators, Steve Mitchell and Monte Stebens, stayed in Russell until all files were completed. DES would like to thank the environmental coordinators and all other employees who worked on the information response.  Everyone did an excellent job. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting. I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
The 2001 environmental roundtable  has been confirmed  for the above location and dates.   Make your reservations at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (505) 821-3333.  The hotel is located on the frontage road off I-25 north at the Paso del Norte exit.  Room rates are $89.00 per night.  A block of rooms is being held under ""Enron Transportations Services-Environmental Roundtable"".  The agenda for the roundtable is presented below: Tuesday October 16th 7:00-8:00 am  Contintental Breakfast. 8:00-8:15 am  Welcome and Opening Remarks. 8:15-8:45 am  Bill Kendrick, Director Environmental Affairs, ETS. 8:45-9:15 am  Chad Ingalls, The Nature Conservancy (Station 2 Project). 9:15-10:00 am  Ruth Jensen, Air Issues and Compliance. 10:00-10:15 am  BREAK 10:15-11:15 am  Denise Celani Safety Kleen.  ""What happens to your waste 
Ruth, I spoke to the ADEQ about the accelerated permit program and apparently there are some internal problems with this program and the third party contractors which are on their ""list"".  At this stage of the game, they recommended that we do not resort to this alternative as most of the work that the contractor would do has been done by the ADEQ allready.  I then indicated that I would be contacting the Director of the ADEQ about the urgency of this multi million dollar project and the benefits to the state of Arizona.  The permit engineer thought that would be a good idea. Because we will be permitting through this agency again for Sundevil, and dont want to upset the agency cart, I am going to speak with the permit engineers supervisor and then to the Director of the ADEQ next week about either an accelerated issuance of the permit or more realistically, allowance to do some construction activities while the ADEQ is completing the review and permit writing.  This way, I wont step on any toes.  By the way, the ADEQ said that they dont consider this to be a PSD issue.  The following time line for permit issuance under the Arizona laws at this stage appears to be: another 2-3 weeks to write the permit, one month by the ADEQ technical staff to do the required internal review and then the  EPA is given a one month period to do their review, which is requried by the EPA for all class 1 permit applications in Arizona.  Because Im going to be in Phoenix next week, I might be able to set a meeting up with the ADEQ Director and plead Transwestern's case.  Ill let you know how it goes...... 
John, I look forward to you being there, hopefully,  for both days.  Your presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment from Houston. Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.  The second moring will be devoted to a  ""surprise"" participation at a local compressor station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.  I havent spread this around yet, except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they want.  The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams. thoughts comments...... 
Scott, thanks for the effort in this.  Am looking forward to your reports for sta. 3 and 4 at your earliest convenience .... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 08/31/2001 02:11:17 PM 
John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and 1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station 2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than 30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the Navajos have said ""yes"" and he would charge into the field and do the surveys. 
Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit issue: [Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.

Ill keep you apprised of this issue.] I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, tomorrow. Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air permits: all earthwork trench construction and piping tie ins all foundation and building construction installation of ancillary equipment This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may allow us to do.

John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure

Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.  I have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.  Take a look at the document and let me know what you think.  After your review we can make the necessary changes and modifications.  I have been advised by our legal department that each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will undoubtably work for the others.  Thanks for your patience in this. 
After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we could choose this avenue if we desired. 
Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's place? Larry Campbell 09/18/2001 08:29 AM

NNG Gomez Plant, Site Cleanup has been completed.  All activities associated with the items identified during the sale of the facility have been corrected. Becuse ET&S  owns and WGR operates, there is a concern that WGR may not adhear to compliance and housekeeping  at the facility.  This has been the case in the past.  Discussions will be held with Enron Legal to address these concerns. TW Bell Lake Gas Plant, Ground Water Remediation.  A revised Water Development Easement from the State Land Office was received. This will allow TW access to install one additional downgradient groundwater monitor well. The tentative schedule to install the well will be the week of September 13th. A construction permit application for installation of an SVE remediation system for the North Crawar C/S was mailed to the TNRCC. The State of New Mexico conducted an air quality inspection of the Atoka No. 2 C/S.  No items or deficiencies were identified by the agency. The Title V air permit application for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was mailed to the State of New Mexico, Air Qualtiy Bureau. The Notice of Intent air permit application for the Crawford C/S was mailed to the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau. Annual blanket request letters were submitted to the USFWS in New Mexico and Texas for renewal. A meeting was held in Houston with John Woodyard of Roy F.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4. A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased. On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the potential of becoming an ""opportunity"" in the event we are forced to deal with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this...... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 09/25/2001 05:10:00 PM

Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and 4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2. He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to Arnold Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway, depending upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.  Id like your comments asap. 1.  The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble. 2.. The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of startup   and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE   data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60%and lower. The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20% of the time.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.  These values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).  Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60%. 3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit. 4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas. 
The PCB Annual Document Logs for the facilities that generated PCB waste and stored it at TW's long term storage facility were completed and distributed to locations and entered into Envisions. The 2rd quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB mgt. committee conference call was completed.  This committee meets to discusss PCB management on the SoCal system and review invoices generated by SoCal during each quarter.  This quarters invoice amount was $280,633.48 of which Transwestern is 86% responsible or $241,344.79. Final activities are in progress at the Topock Lateral where cleanup of the 1850' pipeline and appurtenances has been completed.  Analytical results of the wipe samples and liquid samples taken showed the cleanup to be successful.   All wipes after the cleaning showed to be less than 1 microgram/100 cm. sq.  Analytical results of the liquids showed to be less than 20 ppb.  The next phase of the cleanup activities will be in November when the remaining 11 miles of pipe will be cleaned and have launcher

This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway, depending upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.  Id like your comments asap. 1.     The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble. 2..  The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of startup        and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60%and lower. The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring    no more than 20% of the time.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.      These values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement     of Basis document).  Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is          concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is       requesting that  a provision be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of   the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60%. 3.      The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit. 4.      Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not         normally used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom     fuel monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas. ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines. We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me know what additional information you may need. 1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest Operations. 2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20% of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.

John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA= =20 permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are. First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours= =20 of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation= =20 because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20 Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20 applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20 triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that= =20 they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that= =20 they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t= he=20 time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need= =20 some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon= g=20 it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20 converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin= g=20 with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th= e=20 PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro= l=20 technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know= =20 time is of the essence. Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and= =20 4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr= =20 or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm= vd=20 for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, = at=20 lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are= =20 40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we= =20 stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we= =20 applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented= =20 this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20 permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads= =20 and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20 conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with= =20 with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou= ld=20 bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue. =20 
Transwestern Pipeline Company Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority to apply a 10%safety factor. For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications. Northern Natural Gas Company A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. EOTT A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. General Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held next week in Albuquerque. 
Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA. 
Shudeish, our advisor in Arizona left me a voice mail message that the signs were posted at both locations...thanks for your help with an expited request to Region IX EPA. ""Shudeish Mahadev"" <Mahadev.Shudeish@ev.state.az.us> on 10/15/2001 01:01:19 PM 
Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other compressor station locations and have been approved to use ""stain tubes"" or total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help. If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us? Kohn.Roger@epamail.epa.gov on 10/18/2001 05:54:40 PM 
Larry, I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31, which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer. Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP, there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks. 2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the sulfur content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, ""Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Fuel Gases"", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) ""Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and Radiometric Colorimetry,"" ASTM D5504-94 ""Standard Test Method for Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,"" or ASTM D3246-81 (Reapproved 1987) ""Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By Oxidative Microcoulometry"" (incorporated by reference under o  75.6).

Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01. Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also. Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for station 3 and or 4. Ill keep everyone apprised of future events. 
With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline Company offers the following response: Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present. Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art monitoring and detection. Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels. This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC. Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, but ""more like 35 trailers"".  The number of mobile home residences currrently in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low. The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The 
Jerry, I have not cancelled the Station 4 air permit.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn,EPA permit engineer,  about the possibility of not doing the turbine installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market commitment.  My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued about 2 years ago.  In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK. If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions of the existing permit for the facility.. 
Just to keep all permit information together, I spoke to Roger Kohn and he has sent to me the station 3 and 4 air permits.  We are now free to initiate construction at these two sites.... ""Van Wolf"" <vwolf@swlaw.com> on 11/20/2001 01:59:21 PM 
As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had copies of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory. Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M Hill, which is trying to start an air group in Arizona. I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued. He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed comments postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he expected both permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov. 30): he said he had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was not problemmatic. Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues, and that did not seem to be any difficulty. I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment period opened by first publication on October 17. The public hearing also must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and that is why it was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of days after what should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19, because Nov 17 was a Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check and get back to me. I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance starts dragging.

Theiler, thought I would drop you a line and let you know how the hunt went. When Ryan and I got to the ranch, the guide gave us both a bull tag instead of a cow tag and said we had the run of the ranch and we could shoot anything we wanted, bulls or cows.  I took your word and didnt shoot your gun, which was a duel mistake, trusting your word and trusting your gun.  I saw several big bulls during our 4 day stay on the ranch and am reporting to you that due to my trust in you, and that jap junk rifle,  I never hit anything. Have you had anything in your life that would compare to the emptiness and frustration of shooting at monster bulls for four days and not hitting anything but dirt and trees?  Not only that, but on the way home, I wreaked my truck and died on the way to the hospital.  Im in heaven now, and spending my time putting the mojo hex on all your future hunts.  However, now I know why you always wanted to hunt with me, cause everyone else that you know and likes to hunt, you have given the same line of garbage about how good of a hunter you are and that  your gun shots true..... Now for the true story.  I didnt shoot a cow, but Ryan did.  I never saw the 30 inch mule deer, but we saw lots and lots of deer and elk.  I can understand why people pay to hunt on private land.  This ranch was a mixture 
The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below: SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas. SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca. Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on

All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California. The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha. Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and 
Midland Team, the Martin Co. No. 1 facility is potentially in non compliance because there is new emissions data from the EPA which shows the units at this facility  emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit. Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test  with a portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed very high emissions.  We have a couple of options.  Spend the $$$$ necessary to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application. The choice is yours.  Understand, this permit if issued, places some recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the Midland team.  Let me know what you would like to do.

As I mentioned in the conference call last Monday , I have set up an appointment with Michael Adewuni at Penn State for 9 am on Tuesday October 26 for the purpose of reviewing his pipeline flow model and potential application to predicting PCB movement and collection points in pipelines. He has performed previous research studies utilizing various hydrocarbon solvents , including  terpinol. Dr. Adewuni has requested that we provide to him before the meeting the following information: Drawings of the particular section of pipe and the configuration; The general volumes of condensate passing through the pipeline; The natural gas flow rate and variables General PCB concentrations found in the section. Please respond and let me know who will take the responsibility for selecting the section of pipe and providing the requested information? Dr. Adewuni 's email address at Penn State is ----    michael@pnge.psu.edu Please also provide a duplicate information package to me prior to the trip for review. Thanks Mike

000/2001 Winter Season 
=20 000/2001 Winter Season As a result of feedback received at the July 6 reliability collaborative, Con Edison has made the following changes to its capacity release/delivery service programs for the 2000/2001 winter season. First, to assist you in meeting your primary point obligations relating to the firm load on our system that you are serving, Con Edison will make available to Marketers 25,000 dt/day on Transco.  Your allocation based on active customers in your group as of July 1, 2000 is 511 dt/day in the form of either: (a) a capacity release of Transco capacity at the Transco maximum rate for the 12-month period November 2000 through October 2001, or (b) a bundled citygate sale for November 2000 through March 2001 priced as follows: *  Inside F.E.R.C.=01,s first of the month index price at Transco/Zone 3 (Station 65) plus $1.00/dt. or; (c) a combination of the two adding up to 511 dt per day. Second, in addition to the above, we can make available to you 204 dt/day during March 2001 as a bundled citygate sale on the same terms as set forth above. Third, with respect to the balance of capacity that you may require to meet your primary point obligations, (a) There will be no citygate allocation requirements for this winter, except for the 25% limitation on Texas Eastern. (i.e., you may deliver     all of your gas to any of the following receipt points, except that no more than 25% may be delivered to Texas Eastern. Transco (Receipt Point: 134th Street - Manhattan, Central Manhattan, Narrows or Long Beach) Tennessee (Receipt Point:  White Plains) (b) We will permit you to meet the primary point requirement using your Daily Load Following Service Quantity (for Load Following Service)  or Daily Load Quantity (for Daily Delivery Service) during November instead of the Average Day/Peak Month quantity used during the remaining four winter months. (c) Prior to the winter, you can trade all or part of your citygate allocation on Texas Eastern to another marketer, so long as the aggregate entitlement for deliveries on Texas Eastern among all marketers remains below 25% of the combined total allocation. Please let us know on or before close of business Friday, July 28, 2000 which, if any, of the above-described services you are interested in. NOTES: 1. We will advise you if additional capacity becomes available as a result of actions taken by other marketers. 2. Bundled sales service is subject to the execution of a written agreement (on mutually agreeable terms), including a take-or-pay commitment and resolution of any creditworthiness issues.

Bret, what do you think about this?  We have pretty much proven that we are not the culprits is this activity.  I have a problem conducting an ongoing sampling for an issue that were not responsible for, even though we initiated the sampling activity.  I plan on visiting the OCD about this issue and either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the data points to our neighbors.  Additionally, because of the turnover and inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time.  Thoughts.... George Robinson 10/22/99 08:42 AM 
The last groundwater sampling event at the Eunice Station was completed in August 1997. Subsequently, the OCD approved our revised sampling plan that calls for biennial sampling. In light of this we were due to sample this past August. I held off on sampling in hope that Texaco would soon assume this responsibility, however, since it does not appear that this is going to occur anytime soon enough I will schedule a sampling event within the next four weeks. Since there are only six monitor wells to sample at this site, sampling can be completed in one day by one person at a cost of about $2500 (including expenses and lab costs).

Do you have the final reads for July and the new ones for August. 
George, after Bret's memo, go ahead and conduct the sampling.  the soonest I can discuss the issue with the OCD is in the middle of November.  I have reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and the evidence weighs in our favor.  At your leisure and prior to the November OCD meeting,  prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based upon the report results and data why Eunice is not the bad guy in this and why Texaco is.  Gradients,  plume elevations and characteristics of the contaminants show that this is not our problem.  Id like to have sufficient evidence, both mine and yours, to force OCD to go afterTexaco and  get us out of this issue. I think this would also help Bret's case for having Texaco (or whoever is responsible)  reimburse Northern  for the costs we have incurred for what is Texaco's problem.

George, I will attend this meeting with you on the 16th. George Robinson 10/22/99 01:42 PM 
On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding environmental issues at the Station. In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's environmental staff person about two years ago. In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have prepared a ""Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities"". This report covers monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.

Mike,  I reveiwed the proposal by Adewumi and it is correct and fairly accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as  what was provided to him in the way of data and history.  His proposed scope seems to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.   I have included Louie in the distribution  and am sure he will have some input. My comments are as follows: 1.  I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at this time.  As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and I  think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot SoCal.  Both parties in the past,  have been helpful and very cooperative in matters  pertaining to PCB's. Because the modeling study will be conducted between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on this. 2.  Also, I would like to see if we can deal with  PCB's and arsenic at the same time?  Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants? 3. Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?  In leau of  the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section to be modeled, will  the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system? 4. I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional PCB's into the SoCal system.  Its been pretty quiet  in discussions with the SoCal  PCB person.  I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the alert when we start the cleaning?  Louie, thoughts? 5. Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.  How will we do this and how do we get it out? 6. Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc. ""Michael A. Adewumi"" <michael@pnge.psu.edu> on 10/29/99 03:15:19 PM 
Dear Mike, David, Larry and Ben: Please find attached the draft of the PCB migration/cleanup proposal as promised. This is only the technical portion of the proposal. Once we agree on the specific scope of the work, the necessary man-hours and the associated budget can then be developed. In addition, we have studied the material given during our meeting and have developed a preliminary list of the data that we would need from you once the project begins. I have decided to attach the list so as to give you adequate time to collect and/or collate this information. Please give me your feedback on the proposal as soon as possible so that we can develop the final version and submit an official proposal. Equally important, the more preparation and planning we do at this stage, the faster the progress that would be made once the project actually begins. Thank you and have a wonderful weekend.

What are the Klan's attitude toward Asians? 
Bill, we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and all went well.  Prior to the state visit, we went through a ""trouble shooting"" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate permitting information for that altitude and temperature.  Solar was very helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the facility.  I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more emissions.  Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.  Because we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued within the next couple of months..... bottom line is that no NOV will be issued for the fuel use issue. William Kendrick 11/06/99 10:06 AM 
Larry--- Will the permit exceedances mentioned in one of your recent weekly reports at the La Plata station result in an NOV? Thanks, Bill

Rich,  Heads up! Larry,  This facility belongs to Rich. 
I just received a call from the TNRCC concerning an air quality inspection to be conducted at the above referenced facility on November 30, 1999.  The person conducting the inspection will be arriving onsite at 11:00 am.  I am planning on being present for the inspection.  It would be a good idea to have available and at the site the following: emissions fees paid for the last 3 years emissions inventories submitted for the last 3 years 1999 natural gas throughput inlet gas analysis for 1999 H2S analysis for 1999 Also have the facility's air permit history for as far back as you can go. If your records have been entered into envisions, spend some time getting familiar with the data retrival and look like you know what you're doing on the 30th.

Alert Posted: 4:25 PM October 7, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice Effective Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pool : South GA. VAldosta Therefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., Valdosta primary pool will be under a Demand Mismatch Order. Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order. This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.00/dth for under deliveries to AGLC's system. Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for curtailments. If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call Brad Freeman at 404-584-4993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-4477.

Mr. C. Attached is an environmental matrix to install EFM on the existing fuel run. All work will be inside the Northern Natural Gas Kermit Compressor Station. The only excavation required will be for a pole and conduit. No asbestos will be disturbed.  No hydrotest water will be used. Roger W. - Am sending you a copy of this so you can obtain any necessary ROW permits.  Please give me a call at 505/627-9124 if you have any questions. ljk

All, ? You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid $1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound congestion). ? As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be expected to be less  negative. ? Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered. ? NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today. ? Scott 
This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be addressed until we begin the process. It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
A meeting was held at C/S 6, Laguna on Tuesday November 16th, to reintroduce the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site. Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why these issues were unresolved in the ""eyes"" of the Laguna.  Transwestern committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues. With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants (chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna. The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.   The Laguna's appreciated Transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental

For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply: 1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas which supplies the applicable turbine(s). 2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be used  for sulfur. These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and Sundays. 3) The measurement must be taken at the location.  An exception to this is that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas. 4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy retrival. 5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule (CFMS) from  the EPA.  Approval of a  CFMS allows a greatly reduced recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.  CFMS requests have been submitted for the  following facilities: P-1 C/S Plains Turbine C/S Atoka No 2 C/S Monument C/S Crawford C/S Bloomfield C/S Approvals have not as yet been obtained.  Until issuance of a CFMS, an applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and sulfur. Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include: La Plata C/S P-2 C/S Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might be required for each CFMS.  I would strongly advise that the La Plata and Panhandle  teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so that the deadlines and reportings are not missed. If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden, contact Butch or myself.

The biennial hazardous waste reporting for 1999 for Transwestern Pipeline Company was submitted to the states of Texas, and New Mexico. A meeting was held in Roswell to discuss air permitting activites and the recent agency inspection of the TW Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Due to the agenciy's portable testing of units at the AToka No. 2 and 3 C/S, A plan was developed to address potential actions which may result from the agency testing.  Also discussed was NSPS fuel gas monitoring for nitrogen and sulfur and other miscellaneous air issues. Texaco has initiated soil excavation of an abondoned pit which may be the source of groundwater contamination at the NNG Eunice C/S.  An Enron contractor is onsite to oversee the activities by Texaco and to assist in the results of the investigation. The 3rd request to Region VI EPA was completed requesting approval of 5 Transwestern and 1 NNG facilities for custom fuel monitoring schedules. Initial requests dating back to 10/8/98 were included with the packet.  A phone call to the Regional Administer of Region VI was also completed. Pending additional lack of response,   a meeting will be requested to the agency requesting action and approval of the requests. Data requests from Argent Consulting have been distributed to the field for the 1999 emissions inventories. Results of the additional archeological and biological survey's for the Gallup C/S power transmission line 7C application have been submitted to regualtory affairs in Omaha.  There were no positive concerns or impacts

Steve Do you see any benefit for some of us (maybe Mike Terraso, Larry Campbell and I - or some combination thereof) setting up a briefing session for you and your staff on PCBs.  We could provide some general information and well as Transwestern specific information/history that might make your group better equipped to discuss matters with some of our customers - particularly PG&E (although Jeff and Lorraine has been a quick study already). Based on Rod Boschee's last email they may be looking for us to replace their line 300 before they entertain any increased flows. Thgts?

Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility. You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.  This letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.  Id like to send this out on Friday or Monday. 
George, Dave Cobrain of the NMED has verbally approved of the soil characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the OCD.  I have not heard from Bill Olson of the OCD yet.  Dave was going to inform the OCD that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite

George/Norm because there is no immediate concern or liability with the partially filled excavation, I want us wait for the official letter from the tribe before taking it upon ourselves to fill the excavation.  I dont want to send  a message to the Lagunas about us taking environmental matters into our own hands without involvement from the tribe.  If there is a reason to expidite the covering of this open area, then lets  send another  letter requesting to do so.  Given the other issues yet to be resolved at the station, lets keep the tribe involved and a part of our environmental activities.  I want to maintain a good working relationship with these people. As you may remember, they were a little irritated by Transwestern's neglect of not keeping them in the loop previously.  Lets not open that type of issue again...... George Robinson 05/05/2000 02:00 PM 
Norm: Per our telephone discussion this afternoon, I suggest you go ahead and backfill what remains of the open excavation that was created when the diesel UST was removed. A closure report was submitted to Ms. Bernacik of the Laguna Pueblo Environmental Department in January. We have not received a formal response from the Pueblo yet, but in a phone conversation, Ms. Bernacik indicated that they would have to take a closer look at the report before making a decision. Regardless, I don't think we need to wait on an approval of the closure report before backfilling the excavation. Thanks, George 
I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico (ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo. The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, and send the results to POEP for review. With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different. The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Thanx, George.  Please let us know what their initial reaction and evaluation is of the conditions at Sta. 6.  Im interested in what their thoughts are with respect to the remediation of  the sandstone fractures and movement of condensate with PCB's.. George Robinson 02/21/2001 01:46 PM 
Larry, I contacted Norm Moreno at the POEP this afternoon. He said that he would contact Ed Steadman, Associate Director at the EERC, and pass along my name and number so that Ed could contact me. Norm said that he would prefer to do it this way rather than to have us initiate the first contact. The other day I found the web site for the research center (www.eerc.und.nodak.edu). 
Rich, this is the public notice for the groundwater remediation at the TW North Crawar facility. Because we are emitting emissions to the air from the contamination in the groundwater, we had to have a permit..... 
Larry, the attached file contains a scanned image of a story that was published in The Monahans News, a weekly paper, on Thursday, April 20, 2000. I've shown the story to Bill, and he suggested that you let Rich Jolly know about the story. Thanks, George 
I hope this works.  MM 
Four of the six new monitor wells at the Laguna C/S have accumulated groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from these wells on April 5th. Lab results indicate elevated concentrations of halogenated organic compounds in samples collected from two of the wells. Three replacement wells will be drilled for the two wells which do not produce water and for one of the wells which only has two feet of water in the screen interval. The installation of the replacement wells is tentatively scheduled for the week of May 8th. A feasibility study for active remediation measures in the former impoundment area has been completed. The Lockridge semiannual groundwater sampling was completed.  Results will be forwarded to the state of Texas. The quarterly groundwater sampling at the NNG Gomez Plant was completed. The recovery system was shutdown from January 17th through April 21st in order to evaluate the accumulation rate of PSH in recovery wells. The accumulation rate of PSH has been reduced considerably from the accumulation rate prior to active remediation. The system was re-started on April 21st and will be operated in a similar manner as it was operated prior to the shutdown. Transwestern Pipeline Company met with officials of PG&E to discuss recent sampling activities on the PG&E system with respect to PCB's.  Results of the sampling efforts have shown that PCB's have moved downstream into existing interconnects and into lines which feed customers.  PG&E has indicated that they will install small filter separators at these interconnects at pricing thus far of around $2MM.  This does not include the costs for the mainline filter separators which should be in service in June of this year.   PG&E has indicated that they will continue sampling at downstream locations to further

The issues discussed during the May 1, 2000 environmetnal conference call were as follows: Home Officing- Employees within OTS and EHS have been asked to pilot a telecommunicating and home officing program.  The reson being to make available desirable office space within the Enron, Three Allen Center and Brookhollow office buildings. MIke Terraso's Replacement-    John Shafer has been selected to replace Mike Terraso as V.P. of GPG for Environmental and Safety.  John was formerly Director of Environmetnal and Safety for ANR Pipeline out of Chicago, Ill. John will assume responsibilities within Enron on May 8. Performance Testing of Grandfathered Units-   There was some confusion with repsect to the internal position within GPG of testing grandfathered units. It was understood by some team members that internal portable emissions testing would only occur if the grandfathered unit had permitted limits on an air permit  or if there was a special need by the DES.  In order to clarify this issue, Bill will discuss this with legal and distribute a notice to the appropriate individuals within GPG outlining the GPG position on testing . Skill Base Pay- Bill is suggesting a reworking of the O&M, field trainee, and Level I, II and III training modules and TV Guides by the SBP review committee.  Bill will distribute to the committee existing documents for reworking and revision.  The committee will reveiw, make changes and return back to Bill by the mid term review meeting. O&G MACT-    Bill will approach Marc Phillips about conducting an internal training for all DES personal on the forthcoming notification and conditions of the Oil and Gas MACT regulation and its applicability to the facilities in GPG.  Bill will notify each DES as to when the meeting is scheduled and where.  An Enron letter will be developed and distributed to the field by 5/5 to notify EPA of those facilities which are impacted by the new MACT regulations.  It will be the DES's responsibility to make the notification to the EPA. MId Term Peer Review Meeting-   Bill Kendrick, Rick Cates and Ken Crowl will keep the DES's apprised of the details relevant to the mid term review process and procedures to be employed for doing the review. Cooling Tower Issue-     A request was made by BIll Kendrick to send legal a list of histortic or active cooling tower sites within GPG, that may have impacted groundwater at a site.   The criteria to be used for this notification is knowledge of chromate use in the cooling tower and/or relative proximity to a nearby recptor (drinking water well). Tracking Cleanup Costs-    MIke Terraso has requested work orders to be generated for tracking costs associated with cleanup and remedation of spills and releases.  The ""cut line"" for the work order generation is $1,000. 
Larry, as per our conversation, presented below are the emissions factors provided by the state of Colorado for the T-7000 Centaur under permit 97LP0653 : PM10   14.000/MMSCF TSP   14.000/MMSCF NOx   0.100/MMBTU CO   0.121/MMBTU VOC   0.0348/MMBTU Formaldehyde  0.00438/MMBTU acetaldehyde  0.00546/MMBTU As you already know, the emissions factors for the Centaur 50H turbine under permit 97LP0885 can be found on page 5 of this permit which was issued on October 6, 1999. Remember, the state has given us until May 19 to have the rolling emissions 
A records review training was given to the Carlsbad Team.   Files were established and purged of historic and non applicable documents. A check in the amount of $5,250.00 was delivered to the TNRCC for the late annual certifications required under the Title V air permit program. All dehys in Albuquerque region were entered into the GRI GLYCALC software to determine applicability to the O&G MACT standard.  Preliminary determinations indicate that no dehys will not be subject to the  new rule. An inspection was conducted of the Transwestern Pipeline Keystone C/S landfarm by the Railroad Commission of Texas.  The inspection went well and no deficiencies ro violations were identified by the agency. Title V air permit for the two Arizona C/S's (Leupp and Klagetoh) which are on the Navajo Indian reservation were issued by the USEPA.  The permits seem to be very lenient in terms of requirements.  Meetings have been scheduled with each field team to assign roles and responsibilities to ensure 
1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project. Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system. PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, according to PG&E, are in place. PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ET&S. Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe. 2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's. Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co.  system which is PCB free. 3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program. Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced. It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks. 4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators. Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm. Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries. PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations. 5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators. a. Siting, Design and Engineering b. Cost Estimates PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter separators may be proposed for installation. The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PG&E presented. One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it will be a 2001 project. 6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection. Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle. 7. Other Issues or Concerns. Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern. PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day. 8. Next Steps. The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
Another meeting was held with PG&E to discuss results of the latest sampling and construction activities on their system.  DAta from sampling has shown that PCB's are steadily increasing into further portions of the PG&E system. The latest sampling results showed positive hits on their mainline system at MP 63.26 where 4 oz. of liquids were removed from a siphon.  The analytical result of this liquid was 10 ppm.  PG&E and Southwest Gas are continuing their internal sampling efforts to identifiy additional places within their systems where PCB's may collect  and would be passed on to their customers. It should also be noted that  PG&E is and will be continuing their efforts of installing small filter separators at strategic interconnects to protect and remove PCBs from entering customer and LDC lines. Annual emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the TW  Walton and NNG Seminole and Plainview C/S's Title V air permits were receied from Region IX EPA for the Leupp and Klagetoh C/S's, which are on the Navajo Reservation.  A roles and responsibilities meeting was held with the Flagstaff Team for the Leupp Title V permit.  A meeting will be scheduled with the Gallup in the near future to assign roles and responsibilities for the Klagetoh permit. The Quarterly groundwater sampling has been completed at the NNG Gomez Plant. Semiannual groundwater sampling has been completed at the following Transwestern locations:  C/S No. 5 Thoreau, North Crawar C/S.  Semi annual groundwater sampling has been completed at the NNG Lockridge facility. Three additional groundwater monitoring wells will be installed at  C/S No. 
Thanx George for the update. Norm would you mind visiting with Ms. Bernacik and explaining to her the difference between the excavation area where the underground tanks were removed and the landfarm area?  If need be we can write her another letter requesting the closure and backfilling of the underground storage tanks. George Robinson 05/25/2000 04:12 PM 
I called Ms. Bernacik this afternoon regarding several issues. 1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date for sampling. 2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th. 3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two additional monitor wells in the former UST area. 4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation, if we still want to get this in writing, it may be best for Norm to visit with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need. 
One of you folks should try and listen in on this.

Received the ""permit by rule"" approval for the turbine power unit changeout for the Keystone C/S. The emissions testing results for the Plains Turbine Station was submitted to the TNRCC. Discharge renewal applications for C/S No. 9 and Monument Turbine C/S were submitted to the OCD. Notification to the New Mexico AQB was given for the power turbine changeout at the Atoka No. 2 C/S. One employee was skill verified for level II environmental During the routine weekly sampling of the PG&E system, it was discovered that approx. 3 oz of liquid had collected in the new filter separator in the PG&E C/S yard.  A request was made to analyze the liquid for not only PCB's but also pH to determine if the liquids resulted from the caustic and water cleaning of the upstream portion of the pipe leading into the PG&E C/S . This is the first occurance of liquids at this location since this new filter 
The Title V air permit for C/S No. 4 has been issued. There are some requirements and conditions under this permit that the team should be aware of and will be required to comply with.   I would like to visit with the team at their safety meeting in June or july to go over the conditions of the permit.  Please give the the dates in June and July when your next safety meeting is.  This Title V presentation should last about 3 hours. 
During the quarterly conference call with SoCal in which we discuss PCB costs on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.  As a result of the PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect. Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77 ppm. Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following: Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered Data collected in 1998 showed that approx. 8% of the liquids were greater than 50 ppm Data collected in 1999 showed that approx. 9% of the liquids were greater than 50 ppm Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now. I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been collected.   We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased flows from TW into SoCal. Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions resulting from the recent ""hits"".  He just indicated that they would be 
Atttended the NMOGA meeting in Farmington, NM.  It appears that the BLM will implement its own noise criteria in areas within New Mexico that are deemed sensitive by the BLM.  The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A). There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted. A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur concentrations in the natural gas.  A  request  was made to the company to determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste. The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week. Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx. $79,000.  Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.  Preliminary sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm was discovered. As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.  A meeting has been scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities 
A meeting was held in Laughlin, Nv with PG&E to discuss the liquids which were received and analytical result of 505 ppm which occurred at the PG&E F/S.  Additional discussions centered around the latest migration of PCB's into the PG&E system and control technologies to stop additional migration of PCB's into PCB free portions of their distribution system. Annual emission fees were paid to the ADEQ for C/S No. 1, Kingman in the amount of  $31,145.26 Annual hazardous waste fees were paid to the DTSC for the facilities that operate in the state California A  meeting was held in Albuquerque to discuss and apprise involved parties of histoirc and proposed activities for 2000 for the 10 groundwater remediation projects currently being conducted in Texas and New Mexico. Received a call from the TNRCC about an air quality inspection at the Irion Co. No. 1 C/S on 6/30.  the team was notified and preparations are currently being completed to ensure that all recordkeeping, permits and monitoring 
As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 6/29/00. Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit. The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator. The following samples were collected during this project: On the Transwestern side: 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample) 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup. 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. On the PG&E side: 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior to deconning was approximately one gallon. 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 cm sq. wipe) 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters. 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have reprensentataive samples of both materials. Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with PG&E. on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time. 
don't worry about the margin call.  it's taken care of.

Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson Due to the great consternation caused by the revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my obligation to give an explanation to the population for my act of copulation. I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through masturbation, resulted in my fornication. I accepted her invitation, and provided her with excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and liberation. She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for duplication but I insisted upon termination, in spite of her fascination with variation. This has caused me great aggravation, and the agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in my humiliation, denigration, and degradation. My wife is considering castration, which would require my hospitalization. Pray that this matter will find culmination in my sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation has provided illumination and verification and will prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

When we do the emissions testing at C/S No. 3, Luepp, we should be aware of the positives and negatives.  The positives being the information which Steve and company will collect.  This appears to be a  very useful tool.  There is also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this facility.  There also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly lower than what was placed into the permit application.  The downside to this effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the difference (1996 to the present).  Additionally, enforcement action could result by the Navajos.  I say this to apprise everyone of the positive and negative potentials involved in completing this study.  From the emission estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the temperature, humidity, engine age and poor engine mechanics should they exist. And finally, we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually emit.  These units have never been tested.  This uncertanty in itself may be the driver to know so as not to have a situation which was similar to what happened at Atoka No. 3 several months ago. 
A meeting was held with the Eunice Team to assign roles and responsibilities for the newly issued Title V air permit for the NNG Eunice C/S.  The permit is similiar to the other title V permits issued to New Mexico faciliites. Assisted the Gallup Team with the preparation, completion and submittal of the Title V semi anual compliance monitoring report and annual certification report. The state of New Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted an inspection of the Wt-1 C/S.  This inspection is interesting in the fact that all combustion equipment has been removed and dismantled and replaced by electric units. Written notification was submitted to the agency several months ago and a written reply was received from the agency that the facility is exempt from any and all permitting requirements. A meeting was held with the Artesia Team to assign roles and responsibilities for the newly issued Title V air permit for the Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Also discussed was the permitting approach which will be followed for the approval to install micro pre combustion chambers on two White units which were found to be out of compliance with the air permit emissions limits when the New 
I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB engineer with SoCal, about a pipeline liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.  Ralph said that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in the past couple of  years (97-2000). I shared with Ralph and up until this year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.  He stated that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).  He said that their data shows the following: 1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level 1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with the collection. I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for

Louie/John, this memo summerizes the results of the environmental due diligence which was performed on the Texas Panhandle and Cortez, Colorado portions of Equilon pipline system for which EOTT may be interested in purchasing.  This memo presents those environmental issues which may be or were identified as a potential environmental concern. Lefors (Texas Panhandle Segment) Assets on this portion of the system which may have environmental  issues were the following:  1-80,000 bbl. liquids product storage tank, 41 small tank batteries consisting of 1-3 product storage tanks each.  Average tank size is 210 bbl.  Approximately 15 tank locations are within 1/4 mile of an existing waterway.  There are stream and river crossings included in this package.  The pipeline crossings viewed appeared to have sufficient  soil coverage and did have block valves on the upstream and downstream portions of the pipeline crossings. 1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V. The  following documents were not present:  emissions inventories and or records of fees paid, O&G MACT compliance (HAP's),  operating permits.  NSPS Supart Kb compliance could not be determined also.  The 80,000 bbl tank construction date was in the 1930's and has a fixed roof.  It has a concrete bottom and the  tank has never been emptied for inspection.  No  Railroad Commission 653 inspection has ever been conducted. 2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present around all tanks that were inspected, SPCC plans were not available at any location.   Interviews with the Equilon personnel stated that there had never been a reportable release from this tank.  In addition, location Texaco MB Davis pump  station had a small 3'x4' UST which received liquids from leaking packing material which had overflowed and visible soil staining was present. At this  location a T-stand pipe had been constructed into the soil berm to allow discharge of rainwater from the containment area.  This water discharged into  an ephermal arroyo which ultimately collects into the North Fork of the Red River, a perennial stream. 3. NESHAPS.  At the Lefors Station, there exists several joints of new and used pipe which is suspected of having external coating and pipe wrapping containing asbestos. 4. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets which are identified in the bid package. 5. Soil Staining.   There was minor soil staining at all locations inspected. 6. There is one active groundwater remediation in progress identified as the ""10 mile hole"".  Equilon will retain ownership of this issue.  There had been two  pipeline remediation projects for which Equilon had reported to the TRRC and had remediated the site. 7. TSCA.  One electrical transformer was discovered at the Lefors Station. It had been tested and determined to not have PCB's. 8. Safe Drinking Water Act.  There was an abandoned drinking water well at the Lefors Station.  It had not been in service for an undetermined period of time. 9. RCRA.  There was an abandoned out of service Fox boro meter at the Lefors Station.  Status of the potential releases of mercury could not be visibally determined. Bug-Patterson Gathering System (Cortez, Colorado) This system includes the following: Lady Bug Station  minor incidental equipment at this location. 1. There were no environmental issues at this site from assets owned by Equilon.  Adjacent to this site was a producer site which had been blowing hydrocarbon liquids into an earthern unlined pit.  There was historic use of this pit.  Although surface contamination from this pit was present, it was not  known whether subsurface soil and groundwater conditions underlying the Equilon assets had been impacted.

In the office yard, several environmental issues were present and are listed as follows: old spent 12 volt batteries empty drums open buckets containing oil and oilfield sludge The  pipeline stream crossing at the Montezuma Creek  showed the pipeline to be exposed in the bottom of the creek for a distance of approx. 12 feet. There were block valves on the upstream and downstream segments of this crossing. 
I want to bring interrested parties up to date on the issue of replacing the fuel mixers with carbuerators at  the Spraberry Plant.  It seems that this replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.  According to the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.  To do this they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their approval.  IE before and after testing.  I am going to request that we be allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing in a third party referenced testing company.  Contractor testing runs about $3-5,000. A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the agency.  In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one unit to be tested but not on all units.  Should testing show other exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger actions requiring perimtting.  Under the circumstances, I think it would be in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting, we comply immediately. I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.  If approved, we should test ASAP.  Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.  Let me know 
A phase I due diligence was completed for EOTT on two liquids pipeline segments in the Texas Panhandle and in Northwestern Colorado.  The assets are owned by Equilon Pipeline Company.  A copy of the findings have been submitted to Legal.  There were some deficiencies and potential liabilities discovered as a result of this activity. Assisted the Roswell team in the preparation and completion of the 6 month and 12 Title V certification reports for the Roswell C/S.  No deficiencies or non compliance issues were identified for this 12 month period. Annual certification reports were submitted to the TNRCC for 3 Transwestern and 8 Northern Natural Gas C/S in west Texas.  There wer no deficiencies or non compliance issues identified for any of the 11 facilities during this 12 month period. The TNRCC reviewed the emissions testing report for the NNG Plains C/S and requested modification to the original report submitted.  The testing contractor was contacted and  a revised report was submitted to the agency. 
I received word from the TNRCC that they will allow a portable emissions test at the Spraberry C/S to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions.  I will send out the letter today to the TNRCC reqesting written approval to do the testing.  I would strongly recommend that the Spraberry Team have the sampling ports installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing completed ASAP.  Remember, the unit selected must be tested with the fuel mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator on.  Whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that 
Max, I spoke to Pete Metzner of METRIC Corporation about the status of the environmental assessment you need for the above project and he said that he has received the packet you sent him but he needs to have additional clearification on some items which are pertinant for completing the EA.  Mr. Metzner was concerned that he would not be able to complete the EA by the specified time unless he discussed these issues with you.  METRIC has extensive experience with environmental assessments, but is not familiar with pipeline terminology and pipeline actions proposed uder the agreement with the Office of Pipeline Safety. When you get a chance, would you please contact Pete at (505) 828-2801. 
Particpated in a Consolidated audit of two facilities on the Northern Border Pipeline system.  Very few items of concern were identified. Submitted to the state of Texas Fish and Wildlife Service annual blanket renewal requests. Submitted to the state of Arizona Shpo annual blanket renewal requests. Submtted to the state of New Mexico Shpo and Fish and Wildlife Service annual blanket renewal requests. A natural gas relase of 1.57MMscf was reported to the state of New Mexico and Houston GPG for a line lowering in an agricultural area. The quarterly Transwestern SoCal PCB conference meeting was held. Transwestern's share of PCB activities on the SoCal system at 86% was 
George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
Larry, YOU ARE THE BEST!   Thank you !   Look at it before you give it out! Thanks Z

Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez.  If the listing you saw says Edwin Coulter, he no longer is part of the group. 
I received a call from a permit engineer with the Arizona Dept. of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) concerning the issue of notification of mechanical activities at C/S 2  Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period for agency review and approval.   Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being performed, I had written a notification to the agency friday evening requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work which was included with the letter.  On Monday, the engineer called and said that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding at the C/S.  After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a change in design.  After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without any notification to the agency. The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise them of such an activity..... 
Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.  Wipe tests taken of the interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.   This was not a standard wipe taken of a specific area.  These wipes were taken over large areas to determine presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.  After the cleaning operation was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the separator.  All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.  I feel we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs. 
I had dinner tonight with a Robert Jacobs EOTT  V.P. West Coast and Ed Attanasio EOTT Senior Counsel.  This dinner meeting was put together by Gary Fuller.  Both Jacobs and Attansio expressed serious concern about ETS's abilty to provide environmental expertise and representation at the EOTT Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our customer, I told them I would pass on this information to the powers to be in Houston. After a review of the environmental records and the compliance load for what Gary has responsible for,  Im wondering if we should  fill the Bakersfield position, or move that position to Midland and possibly use Gary as a ""temporary technical contact"" for ETS.  As you may or may not know, Gary is accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes in providing operation services for energy companys.  Gary will be in charge of the environmental  and safety responsibilities for those companies which choose to use their service. I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that does, at times go above what is required in other states.  However, getting the employees at the Bakersfield location on board with skill base pay will alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled and addressed  by Butch and myself with Gary's occasional assistance.  Having Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person of Gary's reputation and character. In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and compliance will be a full time position with the EOTT, Transwestern and Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training for.  I feel this will be a full time job.  I think we should give consideration to possible using Gary's expertise on a part time basis in 
I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal concerning new hits of PCBs at regulator sites on the Southwest Gas system.  It appears that SWG did some liquids sampling at two regulator locations near Victorville, Ca. and found small volumes of liquid accumulations (less than 2 oz.).  They tested the liquid for PCBs and found concentrations of 230 and 132 ppm.  The aroclors for the two samples were not known at the time of Ralph's notification to me but he stated that SWG plans to do further testing at their other 17 regulator locations.  This additional testing will be conducted in the near future and Ralph stated that he would share the results of his sampling with me.  It should be noted that the location of the two positive hits  were immediately downstream of where SoCal delivers gas to SWG. If we need to discuss this further, contact me at my home  (505) 624-0353 as 
I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico (ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo. The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, and send the results to POEP for review. With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different. The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
This is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at  the Spraberry C/S has been submitted to t he TNRCC.   The data showed fuel savings, as we had hoped it would and we also received an emissions reduction benefit.  According to the agency, this replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will be a plus for the company. My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make 
Tracy, thanks for the heads up.  Beginning in January of 2000, provide me with the new and old serial numbers for each unit and a closer exchange date, as things (scheduling, changeout activities etc.) tend to move dates around. Team San-Juan 05/14/99 09:31 AM 
The Bloomfield Station will be exchanging three turbines in 2000. The La Plata Station will be exchanging one unit in 2000. Bloomfield #1001 on 03-06-2000 #1002 on 03-08-2000 #1003 on 03-14-2000 La Plata #1 on 06-07-2000 These units are like for like exchanges. Tracy 
Ralph, I received the attached from John Shafer and thought about its applicability for use in abandoning your PCB distribution lines. Let me know...... 
You may have an interest in learning more about this product.? If not, that is also fine.? John 
I contacted John Sailane with Invatech responding to his call to Dr. Terraso. The material is a polyurethane foam used to fill pipes that are being abandoned in place.? He will send me some promotional information. Some not-yet-updated information is available on the web at http://www.roartech.com/megafill/claiming that: ?? Over 1000 lf. of pipe can be filled per day. ??? The line will be filled with polyurethane foam to over 50% capacity ??? (in most cases 100%). ?? Meets PCB Mega Rule (TSCA). ?? Eliminates your need to track retired underground natural gas lines. ?? No need for the one call system to be used for retired gas lines. ?? Eliminates the generation of potentially hazardous waste water ?? created by the rinsing method of abandonment. ?? No waiting for test results. ?? No cost for analytical. ?? GPS equipped trucks. He said they have now filled pipelines up to 42"" diameter.

Plug this into the bottom of Page 2 of Attachment 1, which is our response to #19 of the Project Questionnaire.  Also, you might consider inserting this into the cover letter just to drive the point home that we have CESA/FESA coverage under existing agreements. EOTT presently holds a Memorandum of Understanding (M.O.U. No. 2081-1997-97-4) with the California Dept. of Fish and Game pursuant to incidental take of species listed under the California Endangered Species Act (CSA) Section 2081.  This M.O.U. applies to operations (including pipeline activities) related to the North Coles Levee Fractionator Plant and the Rogas rail facility.  EOTT has also reached agreement with Kern Water Bank Authority (KWBA) to use their Section 10 (a) (1) (b) permit for incidental take of species listed under the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA). Also, I spoke with Ed Purcell of Helt Engineering regarding the cross sections showing a trench depth of 7'.  He said he will modify the drawings and e-mail upon completion.  We should probably make note of this pending change somewhere in our materials (see item #8 on Pg 2 of Attachment 1). 
John, this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the  7 mile pipeline construction Rogas Project with respect to environmental  permitting and approvals. The following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies: California fish and game 1603 application Kern County Floodplain Management Agency-encroachment application US COE 404 Nationwide permit- preconstruction notification Reclamation Board- encroachment application Califonia State Fire Marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline Office of Pipeline Safety-waiver to Install aboveground pipeline I am checking to see what state requirements there are for SHPO clearances for this project.  I would suspect that they would  want us to do a field survey prior to construction.  It seems that every Califonia state and county agency is a candidate for notification or approval.   Ill keep you 
John, I have attached the site characteristics for the 4 locations in Az. where Transwestern plans to install the four RB211's.  With this information please provide emissions quarantees for each location (sta. 1-4).  We will use the same gas quality for each location.  I have a meeting with the agency on the 26th of Feb. and would greaatly appreciate the guarantees prior to this date.  If possible, I am going to try and permit each site for 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the 25 ppm NOx number, so I would appreciate your assistance in this also.

On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows: 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 2-10.84 drip locations The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000. I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes to 36"". One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were found at regulated levels..... 
John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

John, Scott Jones, I believe is still on vacation in Hawaii of all places. And I believe you are correct that we have around 15 acres of existing credit.  Kenny, let me know what you want me to do in this. John.Shafer@enron.com on 02/21/2001 06:50:22 AM 
Kenny and Scott, I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed ""good news"" and EOTT must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation as promptly as possible. It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do, that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit. Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer Edward_Attanasio@eott.com on 02/20/2001 07:49:31 PM 
Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our project ""for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank,"" and authorizing the Water Bank ""to extend their incidental take authority to you and your entire project under their Master Permit.""  This is, of course, very good news. The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank. Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased. While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only slows things down -- or worse. My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased. As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed. Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot. --ETA 
This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.  Construction activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, buildings, electrical poles etc.  The state and federal agencies take a very dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to approval.  This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing construction of the proposed activity.  Your assistance in this compliance issue will be greatly apprecaited.   Data generation and agency consultations are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.  Should you need 
Rich, thanx for the sampling update.  Ill pass it along to the apropriate parties.  A cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and down, as expected, with no glaring increases.  Anything urgent we need to discuss? 
I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between Southwest Gas and SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this tuesday.  I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB quarterly management conference call  that Transwestern has with SoCal to discuss PCB related invoices.  As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe) in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline. I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide input for that as well from an LDC standpoint. I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned about compliance with the PCB regulations.  Ralph said he will let me know 
I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only last 3-4 hours. Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on. The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let 
Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last couple of weeks, but heres whats new: A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the Rogas project. The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet. Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary

It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project. The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in Az. was received.  Some changes will be made in each document.,  as the contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not valid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.  The Navajo Nation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on the reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  A contractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12. The F-1 environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by this friday. The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   A meeting with EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/S facilities on the reservation on 3/20.  After the meeting, applications should be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a week. Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of the application.  During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted to remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each location.  This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days, assuming no major issues result.  One interesting issue that might develop is 
Byron as per the Red Rock expansion conference call today presented below are the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility except Sta. 1 where they only have one auxillary unit. Sta. 1 1- Waukesha 350 Hp LRZ NOx 30.48 CO 121.94 VOC 1.31 Sta. 2  2- Waukeshas 350 Hp LRZ NOx 30.48 CO 121.94 VOC 1.31 Sta. 3 2-366 Hp PSVG Ingersol Rands NOx 35.35 CO 30.40 VOC .04 Sta. 4  2-450 Hp Waukeshas F3520 GU NOx 43.46 CO 37.38 
Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you know....... Kenny_Maltby@eott.com on 03/08/2001 02:13:39 PM 
We are going to start the Rogas project Monday 03/12/2001. The first 2500 ft leaving Rogas is across a carrot field that has been harvested and is not in any habitat. The farmer is due to start working the field the 24th so we need to get the pipe laid. The contractor is going to start with a reduced crew and expects to be finished crossing the initial 2500 ft by the end of the week. The following things must be accomplished early next week so we can continue construction. Checks received so we can purchase compensation credits from Kern Water Bank and Area. Be added to the KWB's Master Permit. That will happen when they receive there check. Insurance certificates in the hands of the Kern County Water Agency and West Kern Water. If the contractor has to stop we may be faced with additional mobilization and demobilization charges. 
Terry, the entire facility has not been disturbed.  Only most of it.  Id say approx 70%.  The other 30% has been impacted but not tot the point of disturbing all the vegetation, just foot and vehicle traffic.  I dont have problem with saying the above, but keep in mind, the facility has been there and just because the trees havent been disturbed, doesnt mean that the understory beneath the trees has been pristine.   It has always been Transwetern's policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its locations, especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value (scenery wildlife etc).  I dont have a problem with including resource reports 3 and 7 for vegetation and soils.  I have received a verbal from the US Fish and Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or critical habitats.  In addition, the adjacent lands are of the same habitat types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore, would not be an issue of habitat loss.   There are not any old TW hands around to positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural encroachment of the trees into the area, I seriously doubt it.  Again, TW tried to mantain a postive presence at each site, but did utilize the sites for their intended purpose. In Arizona, we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater.  We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from the closest City (ie Flagstaff for station 2 construction) or from a drinking well source.  In any event, we will test the water prior to discharge and ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the ground.  I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe. If we need to discuss the above, give me a call ""Hackett, Terry"" <THackett@ENSR.com> on 03/09/2001 02:18:52 PM 
I spoke to John Nystedt, the contact person for the Navajo Nation F&W service concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal  surveys at the two C/S on reservation lands.  I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S sites for review.  Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.  However, because of the issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys. John has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are approved to do work on the reservation.  I have contacted a number of individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys 
I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB person with SoCal, concerning the SWG meeting about PBCs on the SWG system.  As mentioned in the last note, SWG has discovered PCBs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into their system.  SWG receives gas from SoCal and PGE at two separate and independent interconnects.  Liquids have been collected at the two interconnects from SoCal at concentrations of <500 and <100 ppm, 
John, Bill this is the latest on the environmental issues for the turbines in Arizona.  The arch surveys at stations 3 and 4 on the Navajo reservation have been completed and nothing reportable was found or identified.  Each contractor is now preparing their reports and hopefully, will have them submitted to their mgt. for review in a couple of days and then issued to TW. The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 2 on Monday.  The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday. Preliminary quotes for the surveys are $4-5000.00 for both sites.  The original word from them was 7-10 prior to giving approval.   This was definatley a plus. Still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what turbine equipment is to be installed at each facility.  GE or Rolls Royce. Additionally, confirmed decisions have not been made as to what auxillary 
Based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone cleaning of his section of the pipeline.  should cleaning occur of this section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.  Vector has been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning 
I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline activities will not disrupt the site. I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be 
The Title V air permit applications for C/S's 3 and 4 were submitted to Region IX EPA in San Francisco.  These were the last two applications to be filed for the Redrock Mainline Exspansion project in Arizona. Assistance was given to all field teams in Arizona in the preparation and submittal of the required annual complaince certifications required under each facilities Title V Operating Permit. 2000 emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the eleven C/S in the Midland Region. A revised APEN was submitted to the state of Colorado for the forthcoming 
Guys, I received Harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements.  My question is, how does the fuel use compare with what Solar says the fuel use should be?  If we can get Solar to provide written guarantees and ""UP"" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the fuel value on the permit.  The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment.  From their eyes, this would be a strong indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some merit.  Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado. Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata? Then let me know.  If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another 
Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility. You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.  This letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.  Id like to send this out on Friday or Monday. 
David, nice touch with the NC.  I sure John will have some ideas on how to best to get this thing going after the NC gets back with you.  Ill leave it up to Mr. Shafer as to his preference to have dinner with Mr. Smith during our June tour of the C/S facilities.  Good to hear that the team  has bought in on supporting the NC by participation.  If you want me to, I can put on a little presentation to the other 2 teams in Arizona and see if we can get their support and participation also.  Let me know and we can do this at one of their safety meetings....... David Roensch 04/17/2001 11:13 PM 
Larry, per your request following our phone conversation today I'm forwading a brief note regarding our dinner meeting last night with the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Hank Hull (Flagstaff Team leader) and I met with Edward Smith, the Northern Arizona Program Ecologist with the Nature Conservancy, here out of Flagstaff.  The purpose of the meeting was to make introductions between Ed and Hank and to informally discuss opportunities in which the Flagstaff Team could support the local chapter.  The Flagstaff Team made a committment in their Team Objectives and each team member in their Peer Committments to support the Conservancy in some manner this year.  To date all eight of the Flagstaff Team members (2 positions currently vacant) have taken advantage of the free membership offered through ETS.  Also, Ed was quite impressed with ETS's sponsorship of the employee and family memberships.  I won't get into the details but, it was obvious that opportunities will exist for the Team to become active in local activities.  So, as a follow up to the meeting, Ed will make a list of the areas and locations the Conservancy is in need of help and forward this list to Hank who will then poll the various Team members and solicit volunteers.  This may take a couple of weeks to get up and running but we should be well on our way by June.  Our goal, for now, will be to committ on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis to providing a given number of volunteer hours.  I'll keep you posted on how things progress. Ed also, offered to come out to one of the Team's meetings and give the group an overview of the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and discuss our involvement with the entire Team.  And last but not least, when you, Bill, John, Rich and Randy come out for your West End field trip we may be able to coordinate a dinner get togeather with Ed to discuss any topics of interest. Just a thought..... Have a good week....... 
Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.  As you may remember, Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire facility near Ft. Stockton.  Groundwater montioring activities have been ongoing since aprox. 1988.  A permit condition states that if three years of groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be terminated.  A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received on July 14, 1999. Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....). Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.  I anticipate that we will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site 
Kermit Team, I received a letter from the TNRCC concerning emissions fees that have not been paid for a facility called the ""Hendrick/Wink Tank Farm"". The letter was addressed to a Mr. Paul Newman of EOTT.  The letter stated that we may owe emissions fees for the facility.  My question is, do you have such a facility in your team area, and what does it comprise?  ie..number and size of tanks, throughput in 2000.  The TNRCC letter was dated March 28, 2001 and we are required  to provide information to them within 30 days.  I just received the letter today.  HELP!!  I need something from you by this 
Kermit Team, I really need your assistance on this.  I received a notice from the TNRCC about the above facility.  Apparently, the emissions fees for the facility have not been paid for 2000.  In light of this, does this facility exist in your area of responsibility?  Please let me know.  If so, I need the follwoing information ASAP to aviod an NOV for the facility. Size of each tank height and capacity Number of tanks Color of tank(s)  and roof(s) fixed or floating roof if floating, internal or external primary or secondary seals how is tank loaded and or unloaded ie trucks, pipeline etc...

Alison, have you found out anything about the above referenced?  The deadline for submitting the FY 2001 emissions fee is April 30.  The TNRCC can levee a fine on the facility if we dont provide them with some informaiton pretty 
I am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which I am receiving.  I have been requested by Louis Soldano, Enron attorney for the Gas Pipeline Group, to apprise you of this situation.

Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year. All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical assets which were reviewed. Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the following: Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee payments were documented NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks were documented Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date SARA compliance and reporting had been completed SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112 Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were available for review There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site included in the asset for sale (permits for the remediation activity is in place) Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were documented Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files. Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased. 
On behalf of EOTT, an environmental records review was completed for a block of Koch crude oil pipeline assets located in south Texas.  There were no issues or environmental deficiencies identified during the review.  A due diligence was recommended to verify confirmation of the housekeeping activities presented in the records review. The air permit modification for the La Plata C/S was received from the state of Colorado.  This modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use as a result of  a change in gas quality supplies in the San Juan basin.

Randy, based upon the records review, this is the only issue that may be a= =20 problem.  If a tank has been moved to another location, it would trigger=20 requirements which were enacted on the date of the relocation.  For instanc= e,=20 if a tank constructed prior to 1973 was moved in 1978, there would be=20 emissions control requirements placed on the tank as required by the 1978= =20 tank regulations.  If the tank had remained at its original location, it=20 would be grandfathered with respect to emissions.  However, because the tan= k=20 was relocated, it is looked upon as being a tank constructed in 1978 and=20 subject to the 1978 regulations and is no longer grandfathered. I was not given this information during the records review, so I dont know = if=20 any of the tanks apply.  If any of the tanks fit into the above scenerio,= =20 EOTT or Koch will be  looking at some major $$$$$ to bring any subject tank= =20 into compliance.  Generally speaking, the regualtions and costs to comply= =20 increase as a function of date.   =20 1. Q.

A 2:00 pm central time conference call has been scheduled to discuss the most recent analytical results from the Topock Lateral PCB sampling.  Your attendence is requested for this call.  the dial in number is 877-795-3687. Conference code 395119.  Bob Iverson's name could not be found in tha Lotus 
Scott, I have sent out twice a request to each of the field teams in the Midland Region to provide some desperately needed tank information to determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland area. So far, only the Midland, Lovington, Kermit, Andrews, Hobbs and Jal teams have responded. I would appreciate your assistance in motivating the remaining seven teams to get this information to me at their earliest convenience.  I have attached the most recent update of the tank spreadsheet for you to pass on to the teams. Thanks for the help. 
Hazardous waste fees were submitted to the state of Arizona. Emissions fees were submitted to the state of New Mexico For C/S's 7,8,9, Atoka No. 3 and Bloomfield. Submitted to the state of Texas an admisistraitve revision for the ""like for like"" replacement of an IC engine at Irion Co. No. 1 C/S.  To meet the requirements of 2 gms for NOx, a catalytic converter has been installed on the replacement unit. 
Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at the Bakersfield Fractionator.  The scheduled completion date for six of the items is 6/30.  I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during the audit.  Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items show up as deliquent in his region.  Whatever you can do to assist us in either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would 
Ed, I would appreciate it very much if you would review the action item list from Scott Jones and choose which items are Koch's responsibility and which items  belong to EOTT, and let Scott and I know.  Ill contact Scott and have him send you the action item list for your review.  As I had previously mentioned, Scott and I have until 6/30 to complete the subsurface investigations and knowing which items are EOTT's and which are Koch's would greatly help us.  As Scott's server is down, Ill phone him and have him send you the action item list.  Again Thanks very much. 
Under the regulations of the state of Arizona, facilities which have a pollution prevention plan (sta.1, sta. 2 and Needles) are required to have an annual training to evaluate pollution prevention activiies.  I have scheduled with the above three facilities to have pollution training on the following dates: Kingman team June 21 Flagstaff team June 22 This training is to be completed by July 1 of every year.  This training will last for approximately 2-3 hours.  Employees that works at any of the three facilities are required to be present for the training.  Your participation 
Bill you may want to sit in on this if you have time.  It seems we have items of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at Bakersfield which were tied into  a previous agreement with Koch for which the action team did not know when the action items were prepared.  The action dates are approaching and   Scott and I are having a hard time getting clearification on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the responsibility of Koch for some of the items.  Ed, the attorney for EOTT, will be requested by Lou, to notify Koch concerning their responsiblity.  If this sounds convoluted, then you know as much as I..... 
After reveiwing the documents entitled, ""Baseline Environmental Investigation of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California"" and ""Report of Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area Tupman, California"", it appears that the following areas should be investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of identified contamination from the above referenced reports: Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons Wash rack area- lead Propane comp. area lead total petroleum hydrocarbons chromates Cooling tower area- chromates Compressor area- BTEX chromates lead In the ""Baseline Environmental Investigation"" report, sampling was only conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989 document in the ""Baseline"" report for specific parameters, but there may have been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or the loading rack issues. One last issue.  As you know, identification of contamination is usually accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of processes and or history.  Report results of the surface contamination do not show there to be an immediate environmental concern.  Due to the age of the facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports. However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the facility. 
I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the trees which are flagged. As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the PCB pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from you identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project. 
Michael, I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about the status of the study.  When will your progress report be ready for review?  It might be a good idea to let us review your report and then we can make comments and recommendations based upon your findings.  Im glad that things are going well with your data and that we may be able to apply something positive towards our situation.  Thanks for getting back with me.

Bob, James, Roger, Im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the Midland Region in completing the attached EOTT tank spreadsheet.  Ive heard from some of the teams but nothing from others.  Im under the gun as to finding  out where the MIdland Region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the only way I can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed onto the spreadsheet.  This is where the teams assistance is required.  I have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will deliver it to the following teams for their valued input: Monahans Team Hamlin/Haskel Team Lamesa Team Big Lake Team Midland Team Eunice Team

Attended the interim team review process and meeting in Houston. Met with the New Mexico Regional Director of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.  Picked up materials to be presented at the Southwest cross functional training meeting in Albuq. next week. Delivered and presented the Work Plan for the Station 9 soil rememdiation to 
Randy, I need your assistance with something.  Im trying to determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil storage tanks in the Midland Region. Bill told me that you have a spreadsheet of the EOTT tanks showing some of the tank characteristics (size, storage, date of installation, state etc). Whatever you have, I would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me.  E mail works best for me. Thanks again. If you send this to me, I promise to let you out fish me like you did in 
Attended the Southwestern Region cross funcitional training meeting in Albuquerque.  Gave a presentation to team leaders on the Transwestern system about the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and partnership opportunities and employee participation . Attended the Navajo Nation training session for newly adopted regualtions for public water systems on the Navajo Nation.  Transwestern has 3 facilites which are public water systems on the Nation.  The new regualtions will be taken back to each location and immediately implemented. A presentation was given to the MIdland Region about  monthly R-3 condensate reports which are required to be submitted to the Railroad Commission.  The status of the field teams participation in the completion of the EOTT tank 
Presented Title V training to the Flagstaff Team.  The training included responsibilities, recordkeeping and semi annual reporting requirements. A meeting was held with representatives of Transwestern and PG&E to discuss activities related to removing PCB's from the Topock Lateral.  Sampling data was reviewed and discussions were held addressing past cleaning efforts. PG&E has stated by letter and verbally that natural gas volumes will be decreased weekly until PCB concentrations fall below 5 ppm.  Transwestern will be implementing a pipeline cleaning of the remaining 1850 of pipe between our M/S and the PG&E C/S.  Included in this cleaning will be decontamination of the additional filter separators and meter runs. Assisted in the compilation and data gathering of the Title V compliance monitoring and annual certification reports for C/S No. 5, Thoreau. The annual blanket request for the Arizona SHPO was submtted for renewal. Notification letters were submitted to the state of New Mexico notifiying the agency of like for like replacements of recipricating engines at the AToka No. 1 C/S.  Additional notifications were submitted to the agency apprising them of engine removal activities at C/S's No. 5 and 9 which would impact 
Eunice team,  The NNG Eunice C/S is required to prepare and submit the semi annual and annual reports required by the facilities Title V Operating Permit which was issued by the State of New Mexico.  The reports are required to be submitted to the state of New Mexico and the EPA by July 19, 2001.   These reports are required even though the facility is not in operation.  If you would like assistance in the preparation and submittal of each document, give me a call and we can set up a time to meet at the C/S to do each report. 
John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress. Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can ""advertise"" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the Foundation. Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification report submittals. Presented annual pollution prevention training for the Kingman and Flagstaff teams as required by the State of Arizona for large quantity generators of hazardous waste. Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components (inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to 
Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion. In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple cycle. Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing. Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to discuss the issue with Arco. 
I dont know if you guys are doing this, but a requirement to your air permit states that the facility is to report the number of hours of operation each year to the Air Quality Bureau for the Catepillar generator.  The report is to be submitted by January 31st of each year.  If we need to discuss this, 
The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity generators of hazardous waste in Arizona. Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico. A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue. Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine

Be advised that there will be a meeting on Thursday 11:00 am August 23 at the NNG Turbine station, south of Kermit Tx.  to complete and submit annual certification reports which are required by the following Title V permitted facilities: Seminole Brownfield Plainview Spraberry Irion Co. No. 1 Reagan Co. 2 Eldorado Wt-2 Walton Keystone Kermit Turbine Should a team decide not to attend this meeting, be advised that the required submittal date for the annual certifications for the state of Texas is September 8, 2001.  It will be your teams responsibility to ensure that the certifications are submitted prior to the 9/8/01 deadline should you decide 
Participated in the compliation and submittal of the Title V semi annual monitoring and annual certification reports for the NNG Eunice C/S. Data gathering and correspondance continues with the third party lawyer for the NOV issue at the P-1 C/S.  This involved a like for like replacement of a turbine in New Mexico. Annual blanket renewal requests were submitted to the Texas SHPO and the Arizona F&W. A permit be rule has been submitted to the TNRCC for the like for like I/C engine replacement at the NNG Reagan Co 2 C/S. The EOTT tank database is 90% complete.  Field verification with each team will begin to determine  compliance with recordkeeping, fees, NSPS and air permit status.  Air permits for the EOTT facilities in New Mexico were copied from the  agencies records.  Compliance status will be determined for these 
In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance: Hobbs team  August 6 8:00 am Lovington team  August 7 8:00 am Jal team  August 8 8:00 am Eunice team  August 9 8:00 am I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.  Your patience and assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.  If a 
I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future. In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list. 
A meeting was held with the third party attorney who is providing assistance with the recently issued NOV for the P-1 C/S over a like for like turbine exchange which occurred in 1996.  A history was given of the incidents which led up to the NOV being issued and results of the meeting which Transwestern had with the AQB in 1996 which lead Transwestern to believe that issue had been resolved. The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted to each generator of PCBs on the Transwestern system. Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases  to the TNRCC.  The agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.  An incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near MIdland led to this emergency training being given.  Based upon a phone call with Region 7 of the TNRCC, the agency stated that they will be issuing NOV's to facilities that submit incomplete ""Upset/Maintenance NOtification Forms for 
A newly revised rule (Subpart HH) has just been implemented by the EPA concerning curde oil tanks with a daily throughput of equal to or greater than 500 bbls. per day.  If there is any tank within your teams area of responsiblity which equals or exceeds the 500 bbls. per day throughput criteria, please provide to me the following: tank name/serial number tank size average daily throughput Thanks for your help in this matter.... 
Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance=20 status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.

Box 339 Window Rock, AZ 86515 Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager US EPA    Region IX 75 Hawthorne Street San Francisco, CA 94105 Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6) Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also. I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station 4 and 5 reports to station 5. The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022.. 
The Air Quality Bureau conducted an agency inspection of C/S's 7 Mountainair and 8 Corona.  There were no deficiencies or items of concern identified by the inspector. Facility records were copied from the Air Quality Bureas files in Santa Fe for the P-1 C/S. The excess emissions semiannual report as required under NSPS for turbines was submitted for the Bloomfield C/S. A custom fuel monitoring schedule  reqeust was submitted to Region VI EPA for the NNG Plains turbine C/S. Emissions fees were submitted for Laguna C/S. A meeting will be held with the vice president of development for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation to begin preparation of a MOU between Enron and the Foundation.  The meeting will be held in Albuq. during the 1st or 3rd week in 
Advisors, presented below is a memo from GPG Houston requesting that we provide to them the number of ETS employees in each team who have taken advantage of the one year free membership with The Nature Conservancy. Apparently there is some concern that employees are not taking advantage of the opportunity which has been provided for them to get involved with an organization that has some benefit towards wildlife and habitat preservation and enhancement.  Should an employee desire to sign up for the one year free memebership, the Conservancy the web address is www.tnc.org.  You can click the button that says ""Become a member"" and sign up for the annual membership at that time.  At the request of Mr. John Shafer, please provide to me a total by  team of the number of individuals which have signed up with the Nature Conservancy by the end of the month. Your assistance in this is greatly appreciated 
Kevin, as promised, attached is the information that was found by David Roensch on environemntal perspectives in the Flagstaff area...... 
George, Dave Cobrain of the NMED has verbally approved of the soil characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the OCD.  I have not heard from Bill Olson of the OCD yet.  Dave was going to inform the OCD that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite 
Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix. The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona. I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful 
The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are 
The Southwest Region will be hosting its 2001 environmental roundtable in Albuquerque, NM on October 16-17 at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (505) 821-3333.  Room rates are $89.00 per night.  Each attendee will be responsible for his/her room reservations for the two day event.  The agenda for this roundtable will be sent out in the near future.  If you would like to be a speaker and give a presentation on a topic or product please send to my attention for possible incorporation into the program. In order to hold a sufficient block of rooms, provide adequate roundtable space and accomodations,  your reply is required to my attention via emal or 
As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential risk impact.  A rating of ""0"" indicates that there is no risk associated with this regulation or issue and a rating of ""3"" indicates a major problem or an issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or formally close each issue. Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of information presented. General Pipeline Characteristics ; This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small volumes of compressor oils are collected. All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future. The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). this is a non Title V major source. NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their underground storage capacity. NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the agencies. Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas. Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. Risk: 0  Cost: $0 Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices (<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved. Risk: 0  Cost: $0 PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected. Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown. Risk:  1  Cost: $0 Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment which may have been used. Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000 Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous waste. Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous waste. Risk: 0  Cost:  0 NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company. Risk:  1  Cost:  $500 Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure of this site is expected in the near future. Risk: 1  Cost: $500 LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas Plant. Risk: 0  Cost:  $0 Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks. Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately $94,000. Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000 Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature. Risk: 1   Cost: $0 Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park. The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts. NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this site. Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000 Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been identified as a contributing member to the contamination. Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956. During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in 1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds. Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance coverage  appears to be somewhat premature. Risk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000 
The State of New Mexico conducted a surprise air inspection of the TW Atoka No.3 C/S.  The agency found no non compliance issues or violoations during the inspection. The second quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee meeting was held this week.  Transwestern's share of the PCB management and disposal activities on the SoCal system for the quarter was $125,950.00. The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  The original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years without resolution, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.   A conference call will be set up to discuss Transwestern's next course of action. The summary report for due diligence conducted in Portland Ore. was completed and submitted to Environmental Affairs in Houston. 
Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet. A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year. Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern. Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed project for Transwestern Pipeline Company. Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th NFL meeting in MIdland. 
Leon, thanks for the list.  If this is a complete list of the parts which are replaced, what parts are ""common"" between the 3505 and the 4700?  Bill Scott is the attorney on this for Enron and I have copied him on this correspondence  ""wcs@modrallcom.""  Plese keep him in the loop on this...... ""Leon O'Bryan"" <OBryan_Leon_L@solarturbines.com> on 08/27/2001 01:51:31 PM 
Larry, The hardware that is replaced during overhauls is: All Bearings (#1,#2,#3) All seals #1 brg, IGV & variable stators, #2 brg, #3 brg, #1 nozzle,              #2 nozzle, #3 nozzle All hardware (nuts, bolts, washers for cases, housings etc.) All gaskets and packings (air/oil tube, oil drain tubes etc) All o-rings (oil inlet tubes, etc) This applies to recoupes and standard engines.  The thing different on the recoupe is that some of the hardware for the cases is different and the internal blankets are replaced. If you have any questions or if I can be of further service, please do not hesitate to give me a call. Leon O'Bryan (801) 352-5100-office (801) 560-2136-Cell 
John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera to handle the panarama part of the equations.  In conversations with Doug Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you shortly after the trip... 
Particpated in the EPA NFL spill release and discharge data request for the Midland Region. A meeting was held with the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality Bureau concerning the NOV for the P-1 C/S.  Transwestern presented letters from the AQB to Transwestern which apparently had not been reviewed by the AQB prior to issuance of the NOV.  The AQB requested a delay to re evaluate the new evidence which had been given to them.  They indicated that they

NORTHERN NATURAL GAS Reviewed Title V Operating Permit renewal applications with field teams for Finney Co. 1, Finney Co. 3 and Fowler.  Contractor has made revisions and the permit applications will be overnighted to the State of Kansas for Monday, September 10, 2001 delivery. TRANSWESTERN EOTT Started EPA 308 Request response Tuesday, September 4, 2001 at Russell, Kansas and for EOTT releases in the Amarillo Region.  Large contingency of employees worked jointly to provide files on each release experienced since 1998.  DES had Title V Operating Permits due so environmental coordinators, Steve Mitchell and Monte Stebens, stayed in Russell until all files were completed. DES would like to thank the environmental coordinators and all other employees who worked on the information response.  Everyone did an excellent job. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting. I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you

Scott, thanks for the effort in this.  Am looking forward to your reports for sta. 3 and 4 at your earliest convenience .... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 08/31/2001 02:11:17 PM 
John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and 1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station 2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than 30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the Navajos have said ""yes"" and he would charge into the field and do the surveys. 
Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit issue: [Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.

Ill keep you apprised of this issue.] I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, tomorrow. Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air permits: all earthwork trench construction and piping tie ins all foundation and building construction installation of ancillary equipment This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may allow us to do.

In light of the recent PCB issue with PG&E on the Topock Lateral,  I have asked Mr. John Woodyard of Roy F. Westin to c ome to Houston and make a presentation on PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  Mr. Woodyard has considerable experience in the management of PCB's and works closely in industry associations (INGAA and GRI),  Mr. Woodyard also works as a consultant in this capacity. The date of this meeting will be on Friday, September 3rd, beginning at 9:00 am.  Lou Soldano will be setting up a meeting room and will notifiy all attendees via lotus notes prior to the September 3rd meeting date. I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and 
John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure

Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.  I have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.  Take a look at the document and let me know what you think.  After your review we can make the necessary changes and modifications.  I have been advised by our legal department that each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will undoubtably work for the others.  Thanks for your patience in this. 
After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we could choose this avenue if we desired. 
Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's place? Larry Campbell 09/18/2001 08:29 AM

Mr. Cates, sir, would you please approve of the attached expense report?  You 
Scott, thanks for the effort in this.  Am looking forward to your reports for sta. 3 and 4 at your earliest convenience .... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 08/31/2001 02:11:17 PM 
John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and 1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station 2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than 30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the Navajos have said ""yes"" and he would charge into the field and do the surveys. 
NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY Submitted Title V Permit Renewal for Mullinville Compressor to the KDHE. Submittal of standard exemption documention for the NNG Kermit, Plainview, Seminole and Brownfield C/S's were submitted to the TNRCC. TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4. A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased. On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations. EOTT Rawlins pump station was struck by lighting, causing a release and a loss of crude and the tanks do to fire.

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the potential of becoming an ""opportunity"" in the event we are forced to deal with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this...... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 09/25/2001 05:10:00 PM 
Gentlemen, Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.

Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and 4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2. He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to Arnold Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway, depending upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.  Id like your comments asap. 1.  The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble. 2.. The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of startup   and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE   data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60%and lower. The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20% of the time.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.  These values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).  Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60%. 3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit. 4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.

Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines. We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me know what additional information you may need. 1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest Operations. 2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20% of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.

John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA= =20 permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are. First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours= =20 of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation= =20 because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20 Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20 applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20 triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that= =20 they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that= =20 they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t= he=20 time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need= =20 some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon= g=20 it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20 converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin= g=20 with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th= e=20 PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro= l=20 technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know= =20 time is of the essence. Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and= =20 4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr= =20 or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm= vd=20 for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, = at=20 lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are= =20 40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we= =20 stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we= =20 applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented= =20 this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20 permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads= =20 and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20 conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with= =20 with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou= ld=20 bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue. =20 
Transwestern Pipeline Company Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority to apply a 10%safety factor. For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications. Northern Natural Gas Company A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. EOTT A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. General Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held next week in Albuquerque. 
Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA. 
Shudeish, our advisor in Arizona left me a voice mail message that the signs were posted at both locations...thanks for your help with an expited request to Region IX EPA. ""Shudeish Mahadev"" <Mahadev.Shudeish@ev.state.az.us> on 10/15/2001 01:01:19 PM 
Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other compressor station locations and have been approved to use ""stain tubes"" or total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help. If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us? Kohn.Roger@epamail.epa.gov on 10/18/2001 05:54:40 PM 
Larry, I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31, which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer. Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP, there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks. 2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the sulfur content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, ""Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Fuel Gases"", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) ""Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and Radiometric Colorimetry,"" ASTM D5504-94 ""Standard Test Method for Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,"" or ASTM D3246-81 (Reapproved 1987) ""Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By Oxidative Microcoulometry"" (incorporated by reference under o  75.6).

The PCB Annual Document Logs for the facilities that generated PCB waste and stored it at TW's long term storage facility were completed and distributed to locations and entered into Envisions. The 2rd quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB mgt. committee conference call was completed.  This committee meets to discusss PCB management on the SoCal system and review invoices generated by SoCal during each quarter.  This quarters invoice amount was $280,633.48 of which Transwestern is 86% responsible or $241,344.79. Final activities are in progress at the Topock Lateral where cleanup of the 1850' pipeline and appurtenances has been completed.  Analytical results of the wipe samples and liquid samples taken showed the cleanup to be successful.   All wipes after the cleaning showed to be less than 1 microgram/100 cm. sq.  Analytical results of the liquids showed to be less than 20 ppb.  The next phase of the cleanup activities will be in November when the remaining 11 miles of pipe will be cleaned and have launcher

Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01. Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also. Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for station 3 and or 4. Ill keep everyone apprised of future events. 
Just to keep all permit information together, I spoke to Roger Kohn and he has sent to me the station 3 and 4 air permits.  We are now free to initiate construction at these two sites.... ""Van Wolf"" <vwolf@swlaw.com> on 11/20/2001 01:59:21 PM 
As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had copies of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory. Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M Hill, which is trying to start an air group in Arizona. I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued. He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed comments postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he expected both permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov. 30): he said he had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was not problemmatic. Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues, and that did not seem to be any difficulty. I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment period opened by first publication on October 17. The public hearing also must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and that is why it was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of days after what should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19, because Nov 17 was a Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check and get back to me. I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance starts dragging.

Theiler, thought I would drop you a line and let you know how the hunt went. When Ryan and I got to the ranch, the guide gave us both a bull tag instead of a cow tag and said we had the run of the ranch and we could shoot anything we wanted, bulls or cows.  I took your word and didnt shoot your gun, which was a duel mistake, trusting your word and trusting your gun.  I saw several big bulls during our 4 day stay on the ranch and am reporting to you that due to my trust in you, and that jap junk rifle,  I never hit anything. Have you had anything in your life that would compare to the emptiness and frustration of shooting at monster bulls for four days and not hitting anything but dirt and trees?  Not only that, but on the way home, I wreaked my truck and died on the way to the hospital.  Im in heaven now, and spending my time putting the mojo hex on all your future hunts.  However, now I know why you always wanted to hunt with me, cause everyone else that you know and likes to hunt, you have given the same line of garbage about how good of a hunter you are and that  your gun shots true..... Now for the true story.  I didnt shoot a cow, but Ryan did.  I never saw the 30 inch mule deer, but we saw lots and lots of deer and elk.  I can understand why people pay to hunt on private land.  This ranch was a mixture 
The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below: SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas. SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca. Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on 
The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California. The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha. Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7. A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and 
Midland Team, the Martin Co. No. 1 facility is potentially in non compliance because there is new emissions data from the EPA which shows the units at this facility  emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit. Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test  with a portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed very high emissions.  We have a couple of options.  Spend the $$$$ necessary to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application. The choice is yours.  Understand, this permit if issued, places some recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the Midland team.  Let me know what you would like to do. 
With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline Company offers the following response: Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present. Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art monitoring and detection. Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels. This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC. Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, but ""more like 35 trailers"".  The number of mobile home residences currrently in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low. The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The

George, I will attend this meeting with you on the 16th. George Robinson 10/22/99 01:42 PM 
On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding environmental issues at the Station. In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's environmental staff person about two years ago. In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have prepared a ""Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities"". This report covers monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.

This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be addressed until we begin the process. It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be

A meeting was held at C/S 6, Laguna on Tuesday November 16th, to reintroduce the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site. Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why these issues were unresolved in the ""eyes"" of the Laguna.  Transwestern committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues. With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants (chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna. The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.   The Laguna's appreciated Transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental

Alert Posted: 4:25 PM October 7, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice Effective Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pool : South GA. VAldosta Therefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., Valdosta primary pool will be under a Demand Mismatch Order. Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order. This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.00/dth for under deliveries to AGLC's system. Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for curtailments. If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call Brad Freeman at 404-584-4993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-4477. 
All, ? You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid $1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound congestion). ? As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be expected to be less  negative. ? Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered. ? NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today. ? Scott 
I think its time that we did a maintenace spot check on the White units at the above referenced facility, to stay in line with the operating conditions of the facility permit.  It  would probably be a good idea to check on the

For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply: 1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas which supplies the applicable turbine(s). 2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be used  for sulfur. These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and Sundays. 3) The measurement must be taken at the location.  An exception to this is that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas. 4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy retrival. 5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule (CFMS) from  the EPA.  Approval of a  CFMS allows a greatly reduced recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.  CFMS requests have been submitted for the  following facilities: P-1 C/S Plains Turbine C/S Atoka No 2 C/S Monument C/S Crawford C/S Bloomfield C/S Approvals have not as yet been obtained.  Until issuance of a CFMS, an applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and sulfur. Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include: La Plata C/S P-2 C/S Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might be required for each CFMS.  I would strongly advise that the La Plata and Panhandle  teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so that the deadlines and reportings are not missed. If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden, contact Butch or myself. 
The biennial hazardous waste reporting for 1999 for Transwestern Pipeline Company was submitted to the states of Texas, and New Mexico. A meeting was held in Roswell to discuss air permitting activites and the recent agency inspection of the TW Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Due to the agenciy's portable testing of units at the AToka No. 2 and 3 C/S, A plan was developed to address potential actions which may result from the agency testing.  Also discussed was NSPS fuel gas monitoring for nitrogen and sulfur and other miscellaneous air issues. Texaco has initiated soil excavation of an abondoned pit which may be the source of groundwater contamination at the NNG Eunice C/S.  An Enron contractor is onsite to oversee the activities by Texaco and to assist in the results of the investigation. The 3rd request to Region VI EPA was completed requesting approval of 5 Transwestern and 1 NNG facilities for custom fuel monitoring schedules. Initial requests dating back to 10/8/98 were included with the packet.  A phone call to the Regional Administer of Region VI was also completed. Pending additional lack of response,   a meeting will be requested to the agency requesting action and approval of the requests. Data requests from Argent Consulting have been distributed to the field for the 1999 emissions inventories. Results of the additional archeological and biological survey's for the Gallup C/S power transmission line 7C application have been submitted to regualtory affairs in Omaha.  There were no positive concerns or impacts

A presentation was given to the Transwestern Marketing Group in Houston over the PCB issues affecting sales of natural gas into western markets.  The history and future potential impacts of market stratgies were also discussed. A training session on the Dehy MACT was attended in Santa Fe which was sponsored by the state of New Mexico, apprising companies of forth coming requirements under Title III.  A request will be sent out ot the field for each location which has dehydration to complete a extended gas analysis and rich lean glycol samples.  Notification to the staes and EPA is due by June 17, 2000. A conference call was attended to discuss the C/S 8 turbine project and its fate.  Based upon submitted discussions it was decided to dispose of the turbine, compressor and auxillary box as a PCB contaminated waste and move the contaminated articles to a PCB landfill. The quarterly Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee mtg was held via conference call.  Invoices and charges were discussed which So cal had charged to their management and handling of PCB's on their system. At 86%, Transwestern's responsibility was $71,208.61. Clearances were received from the F&W and SHPO for the additional areas for the powerline transmission corridor of the Gallup C/S which is in progress. A custom fuel monitoring request wqas submitted to Region VI EPA for the Transwestern Lone Star Valero C/S. Installation and testing has been initiated on the precombustion chambers for the Superiors at the Atoka No. 3 C/S.   While fabrication is in progress for the correct chamber,  temporary Waukesha chambers were installed.  Even though the chambers were not of the correct size and configuration, a 12.5% fuel savings was achieved and emissions were reduced by over 56%.  The 
Mike I wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the PCB issue with PG&E.  Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution areas.  With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations (N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock and Hinckley C/S.  The good news is that PCB's have not been detected downstream of Hinckley which is approx. 160 miles from the Topock C/S.  PG&E has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly into customers.  the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter separators is still on target for 6/1/00. Now for the bad news.  At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.  This includes all piping and equipment.  I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no quarantees that the deconning would be successful.   The contract PCB deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 ug.  They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas continues to move through the system.  Additionally, the better remediation approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic locations.  Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management wanted the facility cleaned.  Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx. 3-5 million. I think that this is only the ""tip of the iceberg"".  If they are successful with this action, the pipeline system will be next.  Their pipeline is not piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc.

As a reminder, the state of Texas requires releases of natural gas greater than 119 mscf  to the atmosphere (in a 24 hour period), to be reported to the Regional Offices of the TNRCC.  These releases include but may not be limited to the following:  ESD's, startups, shutdowns, pipeline ruptures and maintenance activities.  Should any of the above activities release natural gas in excess of 119 mscf, a written notification should be faxed to the Regional Office of the TNRCC  within the following timeframes: Unanticipated Upsets- within 24 hours after the discovery of the upset. Maintenance, Startup or Shutdowns- 10 day prior to the expected exceedance. This reminder is being sent to all ET&S teams within Texas because in the last two Northern Natural Gas compressor station inspections conducted by the TNRCC,  they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 119 mscf.  The agency's  inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor station venting for ESD, start ups and shutdowns. It should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the TNRCC's position regarding this issue.  However, until a position has been adopted by Enron's GPG, I am recommending that each facility comply and report as appropriate. The fax numbers for the following Regional offices are as follows: Midland (915)  570-4795    Included facilities-  Wt-2, Walton, Keystone, Lone Star Valero, Spraberry, Seminole Lubbock (806)  796-7107  Included facilities-  P-2, Plainview, Brownfield San Angelo (915)  658-5431  Included facilities- Reagan Co. 2, Irion Co. 1, Eldorado Reporting forms for the release can be faxed to your location by request by contacting me at (505) 625-8022. 
Just a short note to let you know that I received a call from Rod Bosche of PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday. They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E system.   From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by them which Louie has a copy of.  The statement is a little harsh and makes some statements which are incorrect.  Louie and I are planning to attend this meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.  The results of this meeting 
On tuesday of this week, Lou Soldano and I attended a meeting between the above referenced parties concerning the issue of PCB's which had migrated into the PG&E system.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E's and recieves natural gas from PG&E for delivery to its customers,   PG&E has prepared a media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which receive gas from interconnects testing positive for PCBs.  As of today, only the customer base around Needles, California will see the PG&E statement. The two issues of note.  First, Transwestern was able to make some minor changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that this release of PCBs was an isolated incident and that all parties are diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release. A copy of the revised media statement is available upon request  from Louie or myself. Second,   PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the Southwest Gas system to determine if the PCB's have spread into parts of their system. Results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled in a couple of weeks.  Transwestern will probably atttend this meeting. 
The air permit application (APEN) for the the turbine power unit exchange for the La Plata C/S was submitted to the state of Colorado. A meeting was attended with Southwest Gas and PG&E in Las Vegas concerning PG&E's forthcoming media statement which it will distribute to the selected sectors of the public informing them of the discovery of PCB's received from Transwestern.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E.  PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct sampling activities on the Southwest Gas system to determine presence and extent of possible PCB contamination on the Southwest system. 
Attended the construction projects meeting in Albuq. to discuss whether environmental costs and issues are included in the capital projects for 2000. A conference call was held to discuss the late submittals in 1999 for the annual certifications for 7 Title V facilities in Texas.  The results of the meeting it was decided that a consultant would contact the TNRCC and find out 
A meeting was held with the Roswell Team at C/S No 8 discuss roles and responsibilities of the Title V Operating Permit for the Corona C/S. The sale of the TW Crawford C/S has been cancelled.  A permit revision was requested to the Air Quality Bureau to transfer the new permit to the existing facility to keep intact the ability to conduct turbine power unit replacements without agency notification. Preparations are in place for the forthcoming meeting between PG&E and Transwestern over PCB issues on their mainline.  Analytical shows that the PCB's are continuing to move further downstream into their system.  Ralph Komai, with SoCal, will make a presentation concerning  SoCal's experience with PCBs on mainline and LDC systems and present it during the 4/20 meeting in San Francisco. The annual certification for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was reveiwed for completion and submitted to M. Nelson for signature. 
Randy, based upon the records review, this is the only issue that may be a= =20 problem.

Scott, I have sent out twice a request to each of the field teams in the Midland Region to provide some desperately needed tank information to determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland area. So far, only the Midland, Lovington, Kermit, Andrews, Hobbs and Jal teams have responded. I would appreciate your assistance in motivating the remaining seven teams to get this information to me at their earliest convenience.  I have attached the most recent update of the tank spreadsheet for you to pass on to the teams. Thanks for the help. 
Bob, James, Roger, Im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the Midland Region in completing the attached EOTT tank spreadsheet.  Ive heard from some of the teams but nothing from others.  Im under the gun as to finding  out where the MIdland Region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the only way I can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed onto the spreadsheet.  This is where the teams assistance is required.  I have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will deliver it to the following teams for their valued input: Monahans Team Hamlin/Haskel Team Lamesa Team Big Lake Team Midland Team Eunice Team 
Randy, I need your assistance with something.  Im trying to determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil storage tanks in the Midland Region. Bill told me that you have a spreadsheet of the EOTT tanks showing some of the tank characteristics (size, storage, date of installation, state etc). Whatever you have, I would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me.  E mail works best for me. Thanks again. If you send this to me, I promise to let you out fish me like you did in 
In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance: Hobbs team  August 6 8:00 am Lovington team  August 7 8:00 am Jal team  August 8 8:00 am Eunice team  August 9 8:00 am I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.  Your patience and assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.  If a 
I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future. In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list. 
A newly revised rule (Subpart HH) has just been implemented by the EPA concerning curde oil tanks with a daily throughput of equal to or greater than 500 bbls. per day.  If there is any tank within your teams area of responsiblity which equals or exceeds the 500 bbls. per day throughput criteria, please provide to me the following: tank name/serial number tank size average daily throughput Thanks for your help in this matter.... 
Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance=20 status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.  This information is 9= 8%=20 complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the= =20 month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland=20 Region.

Kermit Team, I received a letter from the TNRCC concerning emissions fees that have not been paid for a facility called the ""Hendrick/Wink Tank Farm"". The letter was addressed to a Mr. Paul Newman of EOTT.  The letter stated that we may owe emissions fees for the facility.  My question is, do you have such a facility in your team area, and what does it comprise?  ie..number and size of tanks, throughput in 2000.  The TNRCC letter was dated March 28, 2001 and we are required  to provide information to them within 30 days.  I just received the letter today.  HELP!!  I need something from you by this 
Kermit Team, I really need your assistance on this.  I received a notice from the TNRCC about the above facility.  Apparently, the emissions fees for the facility have not been paid for 2000.  In light of this, does this facility exist in your area of responsibility?  Please let me know.  If so, I need the follwoing information ASAP to aviod an NOV for the facility. Size of each tank height and capacity Number of tanks Color of tank(s)  and roof(s) fixed or floating roof if floating, internal or external primary or secondary seals how is tank loaded and or unloaded ie trucks, pipeline etc... Relative vapor pressure if known monthly throughput maximum fill rate of tank 
Alison, have you found out anything about the above referenced?  The deadline for submitting the FY 2001 emissions fee is April 30.  The TNRCC can levee a fine on the facility if we dont provide them with some informaiton pretty 
Alison, better send me what you have via fed-x or fax (505) 627-8172.  I have spoken to Bill about this.  We need to send a check to the agency to cover ourselves prior to the April 30 deadline. I beleive that EOTT is responsible for paying the fee.  I have left a message with Larry Fensted and  his associate Ruth Ann and expressed the need for the $416.00 check by 4/1.

Bret, what do you think about this?  We have pretty much proven that we are not the culprits is this activity.  I have a problem conducting an ongoing sampling for an issue that were not responsible for, even though we initiated the sampling activity.  I plan on visiting the OCD about this issue and either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the data points to our neighbors.  Additionally, because of the turnover and inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time.  Thoughts.... George Robinson 10/22/99 08:42 AM 
The last groundwater sampling event at the Eunice Station was completed in August 1997. Subsequently, the OCD approved our revised sampling plan that calls for biennial sampling. In light of this we were due to sample this past August. I held off on sampling in hope that Texaco would soon assume this responsibility, however, since it does not appear that this is going to occur anytime soon enough I will schedule a sampling event within the next four weeks. Since there are only six monitor wells to sample at this site, sampling can be completed in one day by one person at a cost of about $2500 (including expenses and lab costs). 
George, after Bret's memo, go ahead and conduct the sampling.  the soonest I can discuss the issue with the OCD is in the middle of November.  I have reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and the evidence weighs in our favor.  At your leisure and prior to the November OCD meeting,  prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based upon the report results and data why Eunice is not the bad guy in this and why Texaco is.  Gradients,  plume elevations and characteristics of the contaminants show that this is not our problem.  Id like to have sufficient evidence, both mine and yours, to force OCD to go afterTexaco and  get us out of this issue. I think this would also help Bret's case for having Texaco (or whoever is responsible)  reimburse Northern  for the costs we have incurred for what is Texaco's problem. Thanx George Robinson 10/22/99 08:42 AM

Go for it! George Robinson 04/27/99 04:14 PM 
I began discussions regarding this issue with Sonny, an employee of Cliffwood Oil & Gas, operator of the Ft. Stockton Unit Water Station. This is the outfit that was taking our recovered groundwater. Sonny discussed this with Cliffwoods' reservoir engineers in Houston and they decided they did not want to accept this water regardless of permit status due to their concern that the relatively fresh water may cause calcium carbonate to precipitate in the disposal well perforations and plug up their well. Lee Cisneros of 4C Construction, the outfit hauling the recovered water, put me in touch with Kenneth McIntyre of Stockton Water Inc. Kenneth informed me that they would accept the water if permit condition would allow it. Kenneth said they would dispose of the water in one of two wells, their University 165 or RS Pershing Well#1. This afternoon I discussed the issue of disposal of recovered water with Doris at the TRC District 8 office. Doris looked up the permit for these two wells and informed me that they were permitted for produced water only. After further discussion of the situation she transferred my call Mark Henkhaus, District 8 Director. Mark said that normally this waste stream would go to an ""oil and gas waste"" disposal facility as you had pointed out in our meeting last week, but suggested an alternative. Mark suggested that I obtain a letter of no objection from the operator of the SWD disposal well and transmit the letter with a request for approval from his office to dispose of the recovered water in the SWD disposal well for a period not to exceed 12 months. He said he will issue an approval for such a request. I think this will be the most cost effective manner to manage recovered water over the next few months, particularly if recovery operations continue to proceed as favorably as they have to date and we can cease active remediation activities toward the latter part of this year. If you concur, I will obtain the letter from the disposal well operator and submit the request to the TRC. Thanks, George 
George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
Tracy, thanks for the heads up.  Beginning in January of 2000, provide me with the new and old serial numbers for each unit and a closer exchange date, as things (scheduling, changeout activities etc.) tend to move dates around. Team San-Juan 05/14/99 09:31 AM

Guys, I received Harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the permits fuel use requirements.  My question is, how does the fuel use compare with what Solar says the fuel use should be?  If we can get Solar to provide written guarantees and ""UP"" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the fuel value on the permit.  The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in need of mechanical adjustment.  From their eyes, this would be a strong indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some merit.  Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado. Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata? Then let me know.  If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another 
Bill, we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and all went well.  Prior to the state visit, we went through a ""trouble shooting"" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate permitting information for that altitude and temperature.  Solar was very helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the facility.  I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more emissions.  Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.  Because we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued within the next couple of months..... bottom line is that no NOV will be issued for the fuel use issue. William Kendrick 11/06/99 10:06 AM 
Larry--- Will the permit exceedances mentioned in one of your recent weekly reports at the La Plata station result in an NOV? Thanks, Bill 
Larry, as per our conversation, presented below are the emissions factors provided by the state of Colorado for the T-7000 Centaur under permit 97LP0653 : PM10   14.000/MMSCF TSP   14.000/MMSCF NOx   0.100/MMBTU CO   0.121/MMBTU VOC   0.0348/MMBTU Formaldehyde  0.00438/MMBTU acetaldehyde  0.00546/MMBTU As you already know, the emissions factors for the Centaur 50H turbine under permit 97LP0885 can be found on page 5 of this permit which was issued on October 6, 1999. Remember, the state has given us until May 19 to have the rolling emissions 
Rick, Terry had informed me that Solar had trouble with this unit in making its emissions guarantees, prior to shipping it to La Plata.  I was not aware of this when I permitted the unit.a couple of years ago. In an attempt to solve the problem, in November,  I had submitted a modification to the permit to the state of Colorado  requesting additional emissions as it appears the unit exceeds its permitted levels during the colder months.  I received a call form the state of Colorado and they said they are hesitant to approve of more emissions for us.  We reached an agreement with the state that they would remove the pound per hour limit and keep the ton per year requirement in an attempt to give us more operating room (the higher emissions months would be balanced by the warmer months which produce less emissions. However, after Terry went through the calculations we were still exceeding the permitted emission limits when we calculated yearly limits.  I dont know if Solar might have sold us a bill of goods but based upon emisisons calculations, the unit cant stay under the emissions guarantees that Solar promised.   We have notified the state of Colorado, as the permit requires and Im sure they will be following up on this.   Let me know what Solar says....... Team San-Juan-LaPlata 01/24/2001 11:08 AM 
Rick, the A-102 unit at LaPlata is at a point, using calculated rolling averages, that it is exceeding the tons per year emissions level of NOX, CO, and VOC. If we continue to run at these points it could mean an NOV. The numbers that we used on the permit are the guranteed emission numbers from Solar Turbines (per Larry Campbell). We were wondering if you could approach Leon O'Brien and/or Ernie Roberts on what Solar could do to remedy this problem. We feel that a communication coming from you and Rich might carry a little more weight then the LaPlata Gang could muster. Larry Campbell suggested that we try to remedy this through Solar Turbines first, before we pursue other avenues. Let us know if we can help in any way.                       Tnanks, Terry 
Midland Team, the Martin Co. No. 1 facility is potentially in non compliance because there is new emissions data from the EPA which shows the units at this facility  emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit. Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test  with a portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed very high emissions.  We have a couple of options.  Spend the $$$$ necessary to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application. The choice is yours.  Understand, this permit if issued, places some recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the Midland team.  Let me know what you would like to do. 
David, nice touch with the NC.  I sure John will have some ideas on how to best to get this thing going after the NC gets back with you.  Ill leave it up to Mr. Shafer as to his preference to have dinner with Mr. Smith during our June tour of the C/S facilities.  Good to hear that the team  has bought in on supporting the NC by participation.  If you want me to, I can put on a little presentation to the other 2 teams in Arizona and see if we can get their support and participation also.  Let me know and we can do this at one of their safety meetings....... David Roensch 04/17/2001 11:13 PM 
Larry, per your request following our phone conversation today I'm forwading a brief note regarding our dinner meeting last night with the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Hank Hull (Flagstaff Team leader) and I met with Edward Smith, the Northern Arizona Program Ecologist with the Nature Conservancy, here out of Flagstaff.  The purpose of the meeting was to make introductions between Ed and Hank and to informally discuss opportunities in which the Flagstaff Team could support the local chapter.  The Flagstaff Team made a committment in their Team Objectives and each team member in their Peer Committments to support the Conservancy in some manner this year.  To date all eight of the Flagstaff Team members (2 positions currently vacant) have taken advantage of the free membership offered through ETS.  Also, Ed was quite impressed with ETS's sponsorship of the employee and family memberships.  I won't get into the details but, it was obvious that opportunities will exist for the Team to become active in local activities.  So, as a follow up to the meeting, Ed will make a list of the areas and locations the Conservancy is in need of help and forward this list to Hank who will then poll the various Team members and solicit volunteers.  This may take a couple of weeks to get up and running but we should be well on our way by June.  Our goal, for now, will be to committ on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis to providing a given number of volunteer hours.  I'll keep you posted on how things progress. Ed also, offered to come out to one of the Team's meetings and give the group an overview of the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and discuss our involvement with the entire Team.  And last but not least, when you, Bill, John, Rich and Randy come out for your West End field trip we may be able to coordinate a dinner get togeather with Ed to discuss any topics of interest. Just a thought..... Have a good week....... 
Advisors, presented below is a memo from GPG Houston requesting that we provide to them the number of ETS employees in each team who have taken advantage of the one year free membership with The Nature Conservancy. Apparently there is some concern that employees are not taking advantage of the opportunity which has been provided for them to get involved with an organization that has some benefit towards wildlife and habitat preservation and enhancement.  Should an employee desire to sign up for the one year free memebership, the Conservancy the web address is www.tnc.org.  You can click the button that says ""Become a member"" and sign up for the annual membership at that time.  At the request of Mr. John Shafer, please provide to me a total by  team of the number of individuals which have signed up with the Nature Conservancy by the end of the month. Your assistance in this is greatly appreciated 
Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix. The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona. I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful

For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply: 1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas which supplies the applicable turbine(s). 2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be used  for sulfur. These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and Sundays. 3) The measurement must be taken at the location.  An exception to this is that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas. 4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy retrival. 5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule (CFMS) from  the EPA.  Approval of a  CFMS allows a greatly reduced recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.  CFMS requests have been submitted for the  following facilities: P-1 C/S Plains Turbine C/S Atoka No 2 C/S Monument C/S Crawford C/S Bloomfield C/S Approvals have not as yet been obtained.  Until issuance of a CFMS, an applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and sulfur. Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include: La Plata C/S P-2 C/S Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might be required for each CFMS.  I would strongly advise that the La Plata and Panhandle  teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so that the deadlines and reportings are not missed. If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden, contact Butch or myself. 
Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion. In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple cycle. Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing. Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
I dont know if you guys are doing this, but a requirement to your air permit states that the facility is to report the number of hours of operation each year to the Air Quality Bureau for the Catepillar generator.  The report is to be submitted by January 31st of each year.  If we need to discuss this, 
The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are 
Michael, our liquids data collections have been pretty lean.  Its only been in the last couple of months where we have actually collected any arsenic data.  I will send to you what data have have with respect to arsenic, including some historic reserch in the Abo field of southeast New Mexico where the arsenic is generated from down hole.  The source is not so much from what is coming out of the wells (catalyst towers were installed in the late 80's to trap the arsenic) as the residual which has collected in the pipeline prior to the installation of the catalyst towers....... ""Michael Adewumi"" <michael@pnge.psu.edu> on 02/23/2000 07:37:44 AM 
Gentlemen: We should be concluding discssions today with regard to the contracting and scope of work issues for our project with Penn State.  A number of data needs have been identified.  Please review available information for the following: Larry - Information related to arsenic - analytical/source informaition. Last three months of analytical on liquids from the pipeline.  We probably ought to pull together the liquids information from late 1998 to present. Sampling and lab protocols.  Any Liquids composition analysis. Earl - Station Three and Four Schematics, Alignment sheets (focus on Section 4 so we do not overwhelm the Professor's team). Gas composition analysis (primarily Needles). Eric - please forward this to Ben Asante, Terry Gallassini, Frank Osborne 
Louie, after the presentation MIchael gave, there were some issues about the data and predictions ie., like how much solvent do we really need to clean the pipeline and the injection intervals and locations, but not whether the solvent or technology would or would not work.  The data did show that terpenoline does remove PCB's from pipeline.  But because Penn State was so deeply involved in the modeling study, and we were still under the PG&E thumb, it appeared to be in the best interest of TW to see it to the end. There wasnt anyone who had any better suggestions or ideas.  The thought was that because of the amount of $$$$$$ we had previously spent, not to see it through would have meant 0 return  for the money we had invested.    And if it works, the money would have been wisely used. The real truth of course is when we do a trial run.  I signed a six month extension to the contract for Penn State (I sent out a memo on this) but not for additional $$$$$$.  They needed the extra time to complete the modeling study and data evaluation.  Last summer/fall, Tiny had been overseeing the operational side of this (ie terpenoline storage locations and coordinating injection points and the pigging activities).  When the decision is made to begin the injections and pigging, Tiny will be ready  and waiting...... 
Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the PCB pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from you identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project. 
Michael, I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about the status of the study.  When will your progress report be ready for review?  It might be a good idea to let us review your report and then we can make comments and recommendations based upon your findings.  Im glad that things are going well with your data and that we may be able to apply something positive towards our situation.  Thanks for getting back with me.

Rich, I agree with  your concern.  The entire Arizona mainline is a potential concern for carrying PCB's into California.  We have verification of this from the last cleaning we did on the San Juan lateral where liquids got past the Gallup C/S scrubbers and PG&E and SoCal both reported elevated liquids in their systems. Analytical results of these liquids in California showed PCB's at regulated levels (ie greater than 50 ppm). Rich Jolly 04/03/2001 07:52 AM 
Gary we won't be able to do any of this cleaning until we get sufficient scrubbers at these locations. One thing we can't afford to do this time is take a chance of moving any PCB'S further West. There are new scrubbers planned for the West locations in the future. Thanks RIch GARY CHOQUETTE 04/03/2001 07:31 AM 
Ben, Ken and I have looked over my tuned TW West mainline model and feel the next area we should target for aggressive cleaning and/or drag reducer is between stations 2 & 3.  This section is sufficiently far away from California that PCB issues should be mitigated.  It has the highest relative roughness (excluding Gallup to Station 4, which appears to be mostly SCADA calibration errors).  Station 3 has more HP than the other stations and therefore more likely to achieve MAOP.  The higher HP and reduced pipeline losses will translate to a significantly higher pressure at the discharge of station 2. By my estimation, we will gain 5 MMBTU/D in total system capacity if we reduce the effective roughness of this one section from 0.00077 to 0.00058. 
I had dinner tonight with a Robert Jacobs EOTT  V.P. West Coast and Ed Attanasio EOTT Senior Counsel.  This dinner meeting was put together by Gary Fuller.  Both Jacobs and Attansio expressed serious concern about ETS's abilty to provide environmental expertise and representation at the EOTT Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our customer, I told them I would pass on this information to the powers to be in Houston. After a review of the environmental records and the compliance load for what Gary has responsible for,  Im wondering if we should  fill the Bakersfield position, or move that position to Midland and possibly use Gary as a ""temporary technical contact"" for ETS.  As you may or may not know, Gary is accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes in providing operation services for energy companys.  Gary will be in charge of the environmental  and safety responsibilities for those companies which choose to use their service. I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that does, at times go above what is required in other states.  However, getting the employees at the Bakersfield location on board with skill base pay will alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled and addressed  by Butch and myself with Gary's occasional assistance.  Having Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person of Gary's reputation and character. In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and compliance will be a full time position with the EOTT, Transwestern and Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training for.  I feel this will be a full time job.  I think we should give consideration to possible using Gary's expertise on a part time basis in

With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline Company offers the following response: Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present. Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art monitoring and detection. Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels. This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC. Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, but ""more like 35 trailers"".  The number of mobile home residences currrently in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low. The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The 
Steve, you have been given all the written permit history and portable analyzer correspondance from myself to and from the State of New  Mexico. All of my air permit files were copied and sent to you previously.  If there is confusion, I apologize but everything that has been agreed to by the State of New Mexico has been made available for review and use. If I need to sit down with you and or others to go over this, let me know. Steve SanMiguel 03/13/2000 08:12 PM 
Larry This will work just fine, just after the call is made to me concerning a NM Audit, please send me a lotus note concerning this request. Their have been to misunderstandings and confusion concerning portable testing in New Mexico and I need this for my protection. Again if their are any questions or concerns pertaining to this request, I encourage anyone to call.

John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel. I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E? As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue up in Flagstaff. Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.  Thanks for your guidance and thoughts. 
1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project. Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system. PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, according to PG&E, are in place. PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ET&S. Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe. 2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's. Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co.  system which is PCB free. 3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program. Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced. It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks. 4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators. Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm. Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries. PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations. 5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators. a. Siting, Design and Engineering b. Cost Estimates PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter separators may be proposed for installation. The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PG&E presented. One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it will be a 2001 project. 6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection. Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle. 7. Other Issues or Concerns. Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern. PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day. 8. Next Steps. The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E: 1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E interconnect/delivery/receipt points?  Future thoughts/plans for additional separator installations. 2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their equipment.  Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs? 3. Internal sampling activities.  How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E system.  (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be nice   depicting this. 4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort to  show our commitment. John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters. If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is $$$$$$$, although they do a good job. Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you plan on asking him to attend the meeting........ 
Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.  Wipe tests taken of the interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.   This was not a standard wipe taken of a specific area.  These wipes were taken over large areas to determine presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.  After the cleaning operation was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the separator.  All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.  I feel we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs. 
On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows: 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 2-10.84 drip locations The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000. I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes to 36"". One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were found at regulated levels..... 
Based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone cleaning of his section of the pipeline.  should cleaning occur of this section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.  Vector has been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning 
The environmental clearances are still in effect as long as we stay on our right of way and in our measuring station yard.  For any construction work at the PG&E station, we will need written aprpoval from PG&E.  I  will notify the state and county of California when we do the construction work.  Earl, I will need to know the amount  of natural gas which will be released during the blowdown of the 1850 feet of pipe, our separator and meter tubes.  Pg&E will be responsible for the notification of gas release for their separator and piping.... David Roensch 08/07/99 10:44 PM 
The following is the update I received from the Kingman Team on todays pigging activities: Tiny, We kicked two pigs today with 55 gals of diesel in front of each pig.  On the first run we got only enough liquid to get a sample.  The pig came out with a big chunk out of it.  Don't know what is causing this because we have received a couple of pigs that were damaged.  This is only the second pig that has come in that we cannot use again. When the second pig came in, we received 41 gals of liquid.  We had to haul it out a pail at a time.  We pulled about half from the seperator and half from the drain tap in front of the seperator. These two runs took us nine hours to run, that is why we only did two.  We plan on putting in 100 gals of diesel tomarrow since they are going to ship some more diesel for us on Monday.  If flow rate permitting we plan on kicking two more pigs tomarrow with 100 gals each. Brent  & Russ Per this evenings discussions with Gas Control, it looks like we will have 60 mmcfd scheduled to PG&E for tomorrows (Sundays) gas day.  Gas Control will make every effort to coordinate flows with PG&E and insure we have higher flowing volumes during the pigging hours if at all possible.  Again the new pigs are due to be on site by Tuesday.   I forwarded an e:mail message to Kingman informing them to insure they split a sample with PG&E on the 15 MP sample point. I've set up a conf. call for this Friday the 13th at 10:00 am Houston time. We should have additional sampling infromation by this time not only from the Weekly Report but on the pigging activites as well.  (877-795-3687   pin 323297) My comments on information communicated to Boschee are shown below. 
Hope you had a better flight home than me - late one hour departing, flew to Omaha and circled because of lightning and thunderstorms until we had to go to Kansas City for fuel, then back to Omaha to sneak in between lightning bolts - the drive home was a combination of being blinded by lightning, unable to see because of driving rain, or praying the car could make it through the flooded streets! Anyway, home by 1:15 AM, so not too bad. Here's what I believe to be our current plan, which will be communicated to PG&E through letter to Rod Boschee. 1.  Continue to inject diesel at a 55 gal rate and pig daily through 8/15 We will be running from 2 to 4 pigs daily (depending on flow rates) and injecting 100 gallon per pig run.  Today (Saturday) was the exception because of flow rates and the volume of diesel on hand (400 gn's).  Two pigs were run at 55 gallons of diesel per pig.  This 400 gallons under the previous pigging schedule would have lasted for 1 1/2 weeks at the single pig per day & at 55 gallons per pig.  A load of diesel will be on location Monday. 2.  Collect liquids from all pig runs for analysis and trending (daily or as often as pigs are received) 3.  Collect liquids from TW's filter / separator for analysis and trending (daily) This is above and beyond the weekly accumulation and split sampling at this point.  The Weekly Split sampling will still continue. 4.  After 8/15, continue pigging daily w/o injection of any liquids to dry pipe through 9/7 5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above 6. Schedule Vector to be on site September 7 to decontaminate a.) 1850' of pipe from TW's measurement to PG&E's filter/separator and b.)  PG&E's filter/separator. Larry/Earl - We're still OK on clearances for ROW and excavation etc... should we need to make a cut into the 1850' of pipe aren't we?  I'm assuming the clearances we received for the siphon project would carry forward???? 7. Post 5 day outage for scheduled pipeline maintenance on EBB as soon as Vector confirms date. 8. Trending and analysis will determine if any pigging or further decon work will be done on TW's upstream pipe. Please review, add, subtract, correct, etc. prior to Monday. Thanks for continuing help - this is going to be a very tough win, if a win is possible. Mike 
Thanx John, I look forward to seeing you at the Doubletree for dinner on the night of the September 3.  Let me know your traveling plans ""Woodyard, John"" <woodyj@mail.rfweston.com> on 08/27/99 09:11:08 AM

In light of the recent PCB issue with PG&E on the Topock Lateral,  I have asked Mr. John Woodyard of Roy F. Westin to c ome to Houston and make a presentation on PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  Mr. Woodyard has considerable experience in the management of PCB's and works closely in industry associations (INGAA and GRI),  Mr. Woodyard also works as a consultant in this capacity. The date of this meeting will be on Friday, September 3rd, beginning at 9:00 am.  Lou Soldano will be setting up a meeting room and will notifiy all attendees via lotus notes prior to the September 3rd meeting date. I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and 
Mike,  I reveiwed the proposal by Adewumi and it is correct and fairly accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as  what was provided to him in the way of data and history.  His proposed scope seems to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.   I have included Louie in the distribution  and am sure he will have some input. My comments are as follows: 1.  I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at this time.  As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and I  think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot SoCal.  Both parties in the past,  have been helpful and very cooperative in matters  pertaining to PCB's. Because the modeling study will be conducted between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on this. 2.  Also, I would like to see if we can deal with  PCB's and arsenic at the same time?  Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants? 3. Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?  In leau of  the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section to be modeled, will  the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system? 4. I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional PCB's into the SoCal system.  Its been pretty quiet  in discussions with the SoCal  PCB person.  I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the alert when we start the cleaning?  Louie, thoughts? 5. Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.  How will we do this and how do we get it out? 6. Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc. ""Michael A. Adewumi"" <michael@pnge.psu.edu> on 10/29/99 03:15:19 PM 
Dear Mike, David, Larry and Ben: Please find attached the draft of the PCB migration/cleanup proposal as promised. This is only the technical portion of the proposal. Once we agree on the specific scope of the work, the necessary man-hours and the associated budget can then be developed. In addition, we have studied the material given during our meeting and have developed a preliminary list of the data that we would need from you once the project begins. I have decided to attach the list so as to give you adequate time to collect and/or collate this information. Please give me your feedback on the proposal as soon as possible so that we can develop the final version and submit an official proposal. Equally important, the more preparation and planning we do at this stage, the faster the progress that would be made once the project actually begins. Thank you and have a wonderful weekend.

This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be addressed until we begin the process. It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
Mike I wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the PCB issue with PG&E.  Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution areas.  With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations (N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock and Hinckley C/S.  The good news is that PCB's have not been detected downstream of Hinckley which is approx. 160 miles from the Topock C/S.  PG&E has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly into customers.  the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter separators is still on target for 6/1/00. Now for the bad news.  At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.  This includes all piping and equipment.  I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no quarantees that the deconning would be successful.   The contract PCB deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 ug.  They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas continues to move through the system.  Additionally, the better remediation approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic locations.  Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management wanted the facility cleaned.  Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx. 3-5 million. I think that this is only the ""tip of the iceberg"".  If they are successful with this action, the pipeline system will be next.  Their pipeline is not piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc. 
Just a short note to let you know that I received a call from Rod Bosche of PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday. They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E system.   From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by them which Louie has a copy of.  The statement is a little harsh and makes some statements which are incorrect.  Louie and I are planning to attend this meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.  The results of this meeting 
On tuesday of this week, Lou Soldano and I attended a meeting between the above referenced parties concerning the issue of PCB's which had migrated into the PG&E system.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E's and recieves natural gas from PG&E for delivery to its customers,   PG&E has prepared a media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which receive gas from interconnects testing positive for PCBs.  As of today, only the customer base around Needles, California will see the PG&E statement. The two issues of note.  First, Transwestern was able to make some minor changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that this release of PCBs was an isolated incident and that all parties are diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release. A copy of the revised media statement is available upon request  from Louie or myself. Second,   PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the Southwest Gas system to determine if the PCB's have spread into parts of their system. Results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled in a couple of weeks.  Transwestern will probably atttend this meeting. 
Mike, I spoke to Ralph and he gave me an open week of April 17th in San Francisco.  He thought that one day would be more that adequate.  I need to have somebody contact the PG&E side for their availablity during that week. Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end with our legal contacting their legal? Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was the following: PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry of the unknown) Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage their PCBs Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental impacts have occurred Michel Nelson 03/28/2000 09:18 AM 
Excellent - If possible, I would wish to attend, as well. I approve the expense and hourly rate. Might be the bargain of the century. Mike Larry Campbell 03/28/2000 08:47 AM 
I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB expert for SoCal, concerning his availability to conduct a training session for PG&E and enlighten them on the reality of PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  He has stated that he would be available to do this as long as Transwestern picks up his expenses and hourly rate ($200.00/hr).  As per your approval, Louie, I will inform Ralph that we are in agreement with his conditions and I will schedule a day when he would be available in California to put on the training for PG&E. 
As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 6/29/00. Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit. The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator. The following samples were collected during this project: On the Transwestern side: 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample) 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup. 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. On the PG&E side: 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior to deconning was approximately one gallon. 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 cm sq. wipe) 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters. 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have reprensentataive samples of both materials. Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with PG&E. on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time. 
Rich, thanx for the sampling update.  Ill pass it along to the apropriate parties.  A cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and down, as expected, with no glaring increases.  Anything urgent we need to discuss? 
Sta.3, 4 and 5 As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta. 3,4 and 5.  Jeff Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample collections at  each of the three compressor station and has three months completed.  This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor station. Stations 3 and 4:   each months reports are to be sent to the following 2 agencies: Navajo Nation EPA P.O. Box 339 Window Rock, AZ 86515 Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager US EPA    Region IX 75 Hawthorne Street San Francisco, CA 94105 Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6) Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also. I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station 4 and 5 reports to station 5. The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022.. 
Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.  As you may remember, Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire facility near Ft. Stockton.  Groundwater montioring activities have been ongoing since aprox. 1988.  A permit condition states that if three years of groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be terminated.  A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received on July 14, 1999. Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....). Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.  I anticipate that we will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site 
James, lets go ahead and provide her with an annual report for Puckett with the information you provided. thanx again ""James Robinson (CES)"" <cypress@neosoft.com> on 08/05/99 04:31:16 PM 
I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only last 3-4 hours. Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on. The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let 
Byron as per the Red Rock expansion conference call today presented below are the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility except Sta. 1 where they only have one auxillary unit. Sta. 1 1- Waukesha 350 Hp LRZ NOx 30.48 CO 121.94 VOC 1.31 Sta. 2  2- Waukeshas 350 Hp LRZ NOx 30.48 CO 121.94 VOC 1.31 Sta. 3 2-366 Hp PSVG Ingersol Rands NOx 35.35 CO 30.40 VOC .04 Sta. 4  2-450 Hp Waukeshas F3520 GU NOx 43.46 CO 37.38 
I spoke to John Nystedt, the contact person for the Navajo Nation F&W service concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal  surveys at the two C/S on reservation lands.  I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S sites for review.  Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.  However, because of the issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys. John has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are approved to do work on the reservation.  I have contacted a number of individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys

I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline activities will not disrupt the site. I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be

I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the trees which are flagged. As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
I just spoke to the state of Arizona concerning the tree removal at Station 2.  Their response to our request to remove the trees has been APPROVED, provided that this is the only pre activity  we do prior to receiving the air permit.  This means that no other  construction or preparation activities can be performed  or conducted untill the air permit has been issued.   This approval also includes stump removal if need be...... 
Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting. I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
Ruth, I spoke to the ADEQ about the accelerated permit program and apparently there are some internal problems with this program and the third party contractors which are on their ""list"".  At this stage of the game, they recommended that we do not resort to this alternative as most of the work that the contractor would do has been done by the ADEQ allready.  I then indicated that I would be contacting the Director of the ADEQ about the urgency of this multi million dollar project and the benefits to the state of Arizona.  The permit engineer thought that would be a good idea. Because we will be permitting through this agency again for Sundevil, and dont want to upset the agency cart, I am going to speak with the permit engineers supervisor and then to the Director of the ADEQ next week about either an accelerated issuance of the permit or more realistically, allowance to do some construction activities while the ADEQ is completing the review and permit writing.  This way, I wont step on any toes.  By the way, the ADEQ said that they dont consider this to be a PSD issue.  The following time line for permit issuance under the Arizona laws at this stage appears to be: another 2-3 weeks to write the permit, one month by the ADEQ technical staff to do the required internal review and then the  EPA is given a one month period to do their review, which is requried by the EPA for all class 1 permit applications in Arizona.  Because Im going to be in Phoenix next week, I might be able to set a meeting up with the ADEQ Director and plead Transwestern's case.  Ill let you know how it goes...... 
Scott, thanks for the effort in this.  Am looking forward to your reports for sta. 3 and 4 at your earliest convenience .... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 08/31/2001 02:11:17 PM 
John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and 1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station 2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than 30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the Navajos have said ""yes"" and he would charge into the field and do the surveys. 
Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit issue: [Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.

Ill keep you apprised of this issue.] I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, tomorrow. Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air permits: all earthwork trench construction and piping tie ins all foundation and building construction installation of ancillary equipment This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may allow us to do.

John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we could choose this avenue if we desired. 
Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's place? Larry Campbell 09/18/2001 08:29 AM

John, I have attached the site characteristics for the 4 locations in Az. where Transwestern plans to install the four RB211's.  With this information please provide emissions quarantees for each location (sta. 1-4).  We will use the same gas quality for each location.  I have a meeting with the agency on the 26th of Feb. and would greaatly appreciate the guarantees prior to this date.  If possible, I am going to try and permit each site for 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the 25 ppm NOx number, so I would appreciate your assistance in this also.

Scott, thanks for the effort in this.  Am looking forward to your reports for sta. 3 and 4 at your earliest convenience .... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 08/31/2001 02:11:17 PM 
John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and 1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station 2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than 30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the Navajos have said ""yes"" and he would charge into the field and do the surveys. 
that was my read also.  I wanted to get some more specifice details on what it was gonna take and then pass it along to construction and you guys.  Can you follow up on this with a short outline of the process and steps for approval? ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 09/26/2001 08:31:04 AM 
Thanks Scott, I heard about the same thing, and was checking futrher to see if this was actually the case.... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 09/25/2001 08:35:35 PM 
Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the potential of becoming an ""opportunity"" in the event we are forced to deal with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this...... ""Patti, Scott"" <SPatti@ensr.com> on 09/25/2001 05:10:00 PM 
Gentlemen, Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have. Thanks,  Scott Scott J.

Roger, thats great that the public notice for station 3 and 4 air permits will initiate on October 4.  I really appreciate your work and effort on this. I will be looking forward to reviewing the rough draft for both of the permits during the first week of October..... Kohn.Roger@epamail.epa.gov on 09/27/2001 06:07:00 PM 
Larry, An advertisement in the Navajo Times on October 4 will start the 30-day public comment period for the Leupp and Klagetoh permit mods.  We will send you copies of the draft permits and statements of basis, which you should receive a day or two before October 4. I will be out of the office until October 22.  If you have any questions about these permits in my absence, please call Gerardo Rios at 415.744.1259.

Bill,  the baseline noise surveys, which have been completed, were performed by Hoover and Keith out of Houston, Tx.  I have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting for the two C/S on state lands.  Ive dealt with these individuals before, but the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on that.  After that meeting, I will decide who should do the applications.  I have  calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the two locations on the Navajo lands.  Pending the outcome of each  meeting, I will decide who to use.  Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits and Indian lands permits, and they would probably be my first choice. I am keeping Mr. Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for Arizona.  One thing that I shold mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project. He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks.  Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units, which will be permitted for a six month period, there will still be an overall  major emissions decrease.  After the six month period, the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again.    Also, my intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25 ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the Northern Border system.  If this was a new station, I probably wouldnt be allowed to use the 45 number, but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine, this should be easy to do.  The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can do, but has had trouble reaching.  One thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations.  By permitting at 45 ppm, this will greatly help this.     Ill share the emissions numbers with you, when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions info I have from the existing units. I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F-1 document for the FERC submittal, and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the report.  Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation, the F-1 report will be completed by March 1. Is there something Ive missed? William Kendrick 02/19/2001 04:44 AM
