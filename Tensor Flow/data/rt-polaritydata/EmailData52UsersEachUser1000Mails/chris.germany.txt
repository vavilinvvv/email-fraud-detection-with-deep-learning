You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though. Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.

We only took 80% of what we could, so we can increase by Market Zone delivery, or not. We have advised any new buyer of the options and are keeping them informed if we are forced to make a move, as in the case of the 15,000 of capacity on TCO. We are being conservative and keeping everyone informed. Chris.Germany@enron.com on 06/20/2000 04:59:21 PM Please respond to Chris.Germany@enron.com 
How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)? jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 06/20/2000 02:53:42 PM 
Yes, we can adjust by 10/15. If we add, must pay retro to 4/1 and if reduce, we may not get any $ back. Chris.Germany@enron.com on 06/20/2000 02:13:20 PM Please respond to Chris.Germany@enron.com 
Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct? 
Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at that price but I will. Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing. Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions? Questions John 1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? If yes, how many meters? 2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips   Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that. Marde I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this.

What would everyone think of having our next meeting in conjunction with the October Customer Meeting? ( October 12 & 13 ) 
Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.  This is the CGAS citygate gas for Energy Express.  We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to Energy Express.  Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to change on this deal. Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport numbers for June.  (Ex  ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract k#65403).  Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS, we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits 
cgerman1682 
Please put the Transco Sims deal #289172 on the morning sheet. The total volume we need to deliver to this deal is 480,000 dth and we may deliver 18,000 dt - 22,000 dt per day.  We currently have 20,000 dt in the sitara. We don't have to call Transco when we change the volumes.

Chris; Can you send me confirmation on the deals that were done for COH outside the Enron-CES agreement. The IF Index for TCO App pool is 4.53 +.0175+.02+transport.  Can you confirm each market area delivery point with volume and delivered price. I need a confirmation record for our files since we are buying this gas on-behalf of someone else. thanks - Charlie 
We are selling 20,000 day to Transco at TP #5564.  It will cost us $.0153 to go from St 65 to the Sims deal, no fuel.  The transport usage deal is 289228. 
Check out how I entered deal 289172, the final prices are $4.415, $4.435, $4.455, and $4.475. 
This is what I see so far for Ogy for May.  We need to buy the imbalance back that was created on the 3rd but we can chat later. 
I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in the end of the month. On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth. On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth. 
Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a problem but just in case. 
New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications. 1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will only interpret the language of the agreement related to ""existing markets"" as applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer. 2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I agreements. 3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for un-utilized capacity. 4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause. My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only transactions would not be subject to this clause. I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your help. 
I released the Transco and CNG capacity to Energy Express for the term of the deals.  However, Boston should recall all this capacity effective 7/1/2000. Transco Offers #20100 for 15 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.4899, Wharton to Algon #20101 for 5 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.8607, Wharton to Algon CNG Offers #13817 for 67 dth effective 6/1/2000- 3/31/2003 from k# 5A2529, transport to Leidy #13824 GSSTE, effective 6/1/2000 - 3/31/2006, Demand Vol = 132, Capacity Vol= 14661. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks Chris 713-853-4743 
Hi Scott, I got your message this morning regarding the releases for the Columbia customers.  I'll call you as soon as I complete my nominations for the weekend. I understand you may be having a problem releasing to EnergyEXPRESS on CNG - I'll see if I can't resolve that... Thanks, David Familetto Metromedia Energy (508) 599-7124 
I didn't even know about deal 219618.  I will chat with Dick Jenkins about this after trading. Drew Hill 05/17/2000 02:14 PM 
Chris, I have researched the buy and sell from/to AEC Marketing for 4/2000. Here are the details: Location:  7126-NFUL/TRCO LEIDY TRANSCO transport demand charge(4/2000)    = $56,078.82 Deal   227196 purchase 9189/day @ NX1 + .22 (3.12) Deal  219618 sell              6000/day @ Michcon Citygate G.D. M.I. + .39(3.39) It seems as though ENA is recouping the demand charge only on 6,000 mmbtu per day.  Do you know if the additional reimbursement has been locked in? Perhaps on the financial side? I 
Whoo hooo!  I just took the demand charge for CALP to $0 for May.  This 
We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked. Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the 
I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this ticket), 268090, and 268093. Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the volumes coming out in August. I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year. Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan@ENRON 05/25/2000 04:52 PM 
If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books [reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES - Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil). Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered with the CES prefix. John, can you fill in the missing details? Cyndie Chris Germany@ECT 05/25/2000 04:19 PM 
John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price adjusted for dth?? I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara. Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563. I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA. John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes? Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals. Let me know if anyone has any questions. Thanks cg 3-4743 
Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left someone out. This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday. East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,833 dth/day from StatOil 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should know the actual volume in the next day or so. Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA. National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000. Equitrans All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES. CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

I changed the end date on Transco deal 231538 from 4/30/2000 to 10/31/2000. My mistake. 
I changed the end date on Transco deal 231538 from 4/30/2000 to 10/31/2000. 
Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left someone out. This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday. East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,833 dth/day from StatOil 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should know the actual volume in the next day or so. Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA. National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000. Equitrans All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES. 
I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara. Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated effective 3/31/2000. 
I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 3/31/2000. The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES. It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice. Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal 227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the credit either today or tomorrow. Thanks.

There are five CNG postings listed below. Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE POSTED May 23, 2000 Dear West Virginia Producer, Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers. For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405. Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors. Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement. Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis. Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type). Forward this information to: Joseph A. Thompson Manager, Business Development Dominion Transmission Gathering & Production Division 500 Davisson Run Road Clarksburg, WV  26301 After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 23, 2000. I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering. Sincerely, H.

FYI- Thanks to the help of Terry Franklin and Dominion Transmission, all our CES and CEM appalachian pools will now be combined into ENA pools beginning June 1.  Hopefully this should help to alleviate some confusion and hassle for everyone.   -AZ 
We have the Equitrans capacity (1,000 dt/day)  through July.  Scott will tell John Singer we need to get out of this capacity.  Scott and I have decided to leave this on the CES Retail worksheet and see what happens. ENA purchased the 19,000 of BG&E space from CES. 
Hey you said I could delete this one.  Yea!! Elizabeth L Hernandez 05/22/2000 10:26 AM 
Can you confirm the price on deal 231760 for Lisa Valderrama. 
This is a CES deal. I do not know who is confirming the pricing for the CES deals. I would reccomend maybe getting with Chris Germany. Please let me know if you need something else. Elizabeth L Hernandez 05/22/2000 09:16 AM 
Who is the trader for deal 231760?  As you can see from Lisa's note we have a price discrepancy.  Can you please help us out. 
It looks like we have a price discrapency on deal 231760 for April production.  Columbia Natural Resources has invoiced ENA  at $3.02 and we have the deal priced at $2.14.  Could you please check with the trader and confirm which price is correct. Thanks Lisa 3-7134 
I just spoke with CES.  CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June since June is the last month.   Please call me when you get a chance to discuss everything. I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.  I want to talk to Scott about that tomorrow. 
Yep.  So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain, right? Crystal Hyde 05/22/2000 12:54 PM 
Hey Chris, The numbers I have in the P&L for the SE  net  are  (297,048) The numbers in your worksheet net are  (281,238) That isn't too big of a difference, plus it is in our favor.   A mere $15,810.  Should I go ahead and let that into the P&L for tonight? Thanks! 
Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF +$.09 for gas this month. EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde is going to check around. Chris Germany 05/22/2000 11:26 AM 
Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June? I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on the EOG and Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.

New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine. There is a new virus going around, called ""work.""   If you receive any sort of ""work"" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT. This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open ""work"" or even look at ""work"" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you do encounter ""work"" via email or are faced with any ""work"" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words ""I've had enough of your crap...  I'm off to the bar.""    Your brain should automatically forget the ""work"". If you receive ""work"" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the ""work"" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum

I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442. We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.  For now, I'm taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000 That's all for now. 
I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424.

Please check on the purchase from AEC Marketing.  The daily volume is 9189, the deal number is 227196.  I'm trying to find out if we get reimbursed for the transport demand charge we pay National Fuel each month. 
I agree with the rates below. 
We have a sale to Tractebel on CGAS with a price discrepancy.  This was a deal we took over from CES wholesale. Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us. Term:  11/1/1999 - 10/31/2000 Type:  EFP Differential: $.235 Point:  Tco Pool 
We can use it as far as I'm concerned.  Have the reimbursements been addressed? 
I will be out of the office Wed, Thur, and Friday of this week.  Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 if you have any questions. Thanks 
we will showing CES a bid today.

You know, I gave you the wrong daily volume for the month of May.  I'm just going to change it effective 5/16/2000 so that the total volume for the month is correct. 
Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions. This is how it will work, Deal #  Comment 268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume should not change. The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094. This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions. Thanks

Robert, would you put these deals on the morning sheet please.  Thanks.  We will not be using the CPR storage deal ticket any more.

I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having problems.  I will try again tonight.  It takes a long time for system at home 
Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last month's pricing. TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change Tenn Z6 And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline. I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up pricing to take care of it. 
To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have misstated something, please let us know. There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know its different volume requirements. Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO. TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ; April = 15% May = 20% June = 20% July = 20% Aug = 20% Sept = 13% Oct = 7 % If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially, shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done). For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April (15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval (I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. Some other basic rules; Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October. Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless overinjection is approved by TCO. Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324. Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need to be used to avoid overrun charges. Why do we care about all of this.... Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for overinjections above 36,304. TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt. Please save this note for future reference. 
I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 (tagg NA1167.8) from 95244 dth to 95246 dth. Please make the following change: Deal 203030 (NA1137.4)  change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 dth, and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth. Please verify the following info; The confirm for deal 169036 (NA0713.1) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800, according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800.  Please verify which price is correct. The confirm for deal 168997 (NA0713.4) shows a basis price of $.455 for April

Molly will chat with you about this and Molly just found out about it. Hi Molly!! 
Has this been done? 
Chris, As we discussed, please get with Brenda Fletcher and set this up as a demand to pay the .0153 storage fee, since the pathing does not allow me to pay through the Volume system.  As long as it is on the deal, it will show up in Settlements and I can pay.  Also, I need it done from January 2000 to current. Thanks, Mark

I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though. All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy.

Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun at Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't buy an airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good. See what you can find me. I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.

I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m. Dear West Virginia Producer, Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers. For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig,

Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.  Cora gave a description of the invoice below.  Let me know what you think. Thanks 
The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU (marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee. 
Could you provide me with this rate again this month, please? 
Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the billing for title transfers?  I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still. 
I'm about to set up 11 contracts on Trco for May.  There is no rush on 
I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on the secondary capacity deal ticket? Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
I think everything is OK now.  I set up deals 260724 (k#B00693026471), 260689 (k# F01978) and deal 260712 (k#I00454).  I changed the end date for deal 235701 (also k#B00693026471 - unpathed) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in Unify for May. Beavy, make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May. 
I was under the impression that the new services were set up by Sylvia.  She had discussed this several times with me in the last two weeks.  You should only have to set up new deal tickets with the new service effective 5-1-00 and end the old tickets 4-30-00. The new service types should be as the below example - The new service type is no longer ""Transportation"", it is now ""Transportation-Pathed"" for K# B00693026471.

What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe that has already been done)? Marlene Hilliard 05/03/2000 05:01 PM 
I was not aware ot the Sonat Style.  In that case, an IT request is not necessary. Marlene Hilliard 
I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this.  Originally they wanted to do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a different service type (so as not to change historically).  To my recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was cleared with Connie Sutton.  So this reversal does somewhat surprise me. RP Chris Germany 05/03/2000 02:36 PM

Scott & Chris- This is mainly just an FYI so everyone has all the same information.  Earlier today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business. Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other questions about this conversation, please let me know. Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it. Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing a hub service for Transco right now. Thanks!  -Angie

Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 1,210,121. I will try to monitor the deal volume. 
I've talked to Jackie and am following up w/ an E-Mail as soon as I get the contract numbers from Gloria.  So there ! 
Scott, when would you like to go over the CNG scoop?

CGLF contracts 66680 and 66681 ended effective 3/31/2000. 
Chris and Scott--Here are CES's final May '00 baseload FOM volumes.   Please call me if you have questions/problems. Please note the increase in the Transco ESS storage injection for May. Thanks. Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317 - May00_FOM_Final.xls.xls 
FYI 
please get together so that we will have the appropriate forward quantities re: CES retail  in the book. 
Has this been addressed? Brenda H Fletcher 03/27/2000 11:53 AM 
The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the pipeline? Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb. Are you working on getting contracts and deals added? Thanks, Brenda 
They are all in really bad shape.  May is looking pretty good though. Brenda H Fletcher 04/24/2000 11:58 AM 
Jeanne, Terri and I need to begin comparing  the April Spreadsheets to the Demand Service P/L Report for flash purposes.  Please provide feed back as to current status of accuracy of spreadsheets. Thanks, Brenda

Friends, Greetings from India.  Just a brief update to let you all know what is happening.  This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book of Romans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai.  I think that is the most exciting thing I have ever done in my life.  I asked the students one day who lead them to Christ.  Everyone single one of them have been saved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in their school over the last year.  But what was even more exciting than that was the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family.  All of the others were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family. That young man's name is Anifa.  He came to Christ through one of the pograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so much, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to Christ.  Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord.  Anifa will honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school knows that he is a man of prayer.  Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach him how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back and reach his people for Jesus. Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated, because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a single Muslim to Christ.  Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I have won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others. Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates, and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler. They will be coming in June and July.  We will be starting 2 new Churches, and ministering in the schools. And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was started last summer by the team from Southwestern. I look forward to seeing you all this year.  Angela and I are praying about God's direction for our future.  Please pray with us that for God's guidance as we plan for our future together.  God bless. Chad Germany ________________________________________________________________________ Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com

Contract 230104 (deal 231301) does not exist.  The correct contract is 560104 (deal 254262).  I just killed deal 231301. 
Robert, our CNG/Cove Point meter is set up and we can fix the 19th.  I just entered deal 253505 moving gas from CNG to Cove Point.

Doug, I'm killing both of these deals.  The BG&E has been changing all month on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.  The CNG changes were made yesterday it sounds like. 
I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.  The CGAS deal is number 250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is $3.53.  This deal is for 1 day only.  The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is 51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60. Thanks

This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the Boston Gas Transport.  I feel much better about this part. Thanks Brenda. 
FYI - THis is information I received on reimbursement from Enron Canada. 
Reimbursement includes both. Brenda H Fletcher 04/04/2000 03:19 PM 
The reimbursement includes both Demand and Commodity. Please confirm. Laura E Scott 04/04/2000 02:36 PM

The transportation invoice from Tennessee Gas Pipeline for service contract number 29667 for February 2000 production included $379,400 in Demand Charges and $5,998.36 in Commodity Charges.  Please let me know what portion and percentage of charges are reimbursed by Enron Canada. Thanks, Brenda

Well, just in that amount of time, I found out more about the deal.... I was inherited from CES.  CES had originally made the sale and when we bought their book of business, we ended up with that sale.  You may want to speak with Chris Germany about it, he was very involved with the CES assimilation. Scott 
Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to ENA - Im Market East. This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice (deal 229101 and 77563) Thanks.

UGI ships the gas for CES.  Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.  It looks like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.  Doug will verify this information and let us know. jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 04/21/2000 11:54:33 AM 
Got an fax from UGI saying that the capacity they release for our customers will be on Gulf/Tco from May thru Sep. I believe this is a change from TETCO. Call me if you need a copy of the fax.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any commodity costs. Thanks JPP Joan.Veselack@enron.com on 04/20/2000 12:12:17 AM Please respond to Joan.Veselack@enron.com 
Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50 split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   4/3 (Intraday)     and 4/4  .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not current and should be ignored. The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back. Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317 - 04-03-00 Daily VolsAM.xls

Also, I have a copy of the March bill.  I will go through it today and give Mark a copy. Thanks. Mark Feldman 03/28/2000 11:27 AM

Well, now that I am somewhat settled into my new home (I'm still trying to hunt down a giant slip-n-slide for the backyard), it's time to throw a party.  This Saturday, April 15th at 7:30 pm, I will have my first official party to put the first beer stains on the new home.  Let's keep this pretty simple and painless, everybody just needs to bring a little something to drink and I will provide the rest.  I will have directions sitting on my desk to figure out how to get to Pearland, for all you inside the loop people don't be afraid, it's not that difficult and long of a drive. If you have any questions let me know and please pass this on to anybody I may have left off the list. Hope to see you all Saturday, Matt Directions: Take 288 S to the Pearland exit (CR 518) and take a left off the exit (going east).  You will stay on 518 for 1.2 miles.  After you come upon your third stop light you will make a right, this will be CR 90 ( there will be a strip mall on your right with a Domino's Pizza on the corner).

Please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice. Transport Demand $2,512,347.00 Sched Fee  $20,000.00 I may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice. 
Jeff, I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in yellow.   I'm still working on the purchases.  I do have 2 significant purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill. AND, I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges.  I call you with that number. 
Jeff, I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date. I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple.  I added the actual numbers per navigator.  I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance.  What do you guys think? 
According to Ed Santa with Iroq, we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998.  I not concerned about the June 1998.  Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999?

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know; Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000? What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above? Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above? Laurie Ellis@ENRON 04/19/2001 07:41 AM 
Chris, have you gotten anywhere with this?  I really need to get this resolved. Thank you Laurie 
713-646-8453 Laurie Ellis@ENRON 04/02/2001 12:27 PM 
It is a CES deal.  I have some support that Cindy faxed me.  What is your fax number and I'll send it to you. Thanks for your help Laurie 
I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I asked her to call me back. Laurie Ellis@ENRON 04/02/2001 09:56 AM 
Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me as soon as possible as they would like to resolve. Thanks Laurie 
No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess (formerly Statoil) is John Bieltz.  His number is 703-317-2318 and his email is jbieltz@hess.com.  Thanks for your help. Laurie Chris Germany@ECT 11/22/2000 12:48 PM 
I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we were not aware of. Laurie Ellis@ENRON 11/01/2000 02:55 PM 
Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets. According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's meter in Zone 4. I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01. I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it 
Hey guy, please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the future.  Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals.  Her email address is Molly.Johnson@enron.com. Thanks dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 04/13/2000 09:06:05 AM 
The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as follows: 'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"". The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was in fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be negotiated. 'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the ""Daily Change' worksheet.   Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues. Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317 - 04-13-00 Daily VolsAM.xls 
What happens if we sell CES spot gas??  It would be fixed price. Maybe we could send CES a different type of report since they have so many deals.  What do you think?? 
I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines. I should have February to you by next week some time. esimien@columbiaenergygroup.com on 04/13/2000 07:11:02 AM 
Chris, I am missing support for MICHON, AWGC, TRUNKLINE, WNG and NGPL. Also, I can't remember when you said we would be getting Feburary. Thanks for all your help. 
Please change the zone location for meters T0012 and T0A62 from North Other to South Other. 
Why is Bill Clinton so reluctant to decide the fate of Elian Gonzalez? Because last time he made a decision about where to put a Cuban, he was impeached. 
Hey gang, the room number has changed to 3084. 
The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us. This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the withdrawals. Which brings up the following issues; *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES at the storage facility. Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one. * How do we track the storage balance in Unify? * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will bill on the net injections/withdrawals I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting. Thanks Enron North America Corp.

uhhh - ok  <=== see no caps. Brenda H Fletcher 04/11/2000 10:45 AM 
The reason for my question is due to a comment in cell 34 S of spreadsheet that says, ""For Retail needs"". Chris Germany 04/11/2000 10:14 AM 
NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract. Brenda H Fletcher 04/11/2000 09:09 AM 
Chris, Do you invoice CES Retail for the monthly and volumetric demand paid by ENA to CALP? Chris Germany 04/10/2000 06:09 PM 
This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 - 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA. Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already) However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May. 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000. Comments/questions? 
This contract is on the ECT April spreadsheet under CES Wholesale.  What is the relationship between ENA and Commonwealth Atlantic? (Who pays transport invoice?  Any reimbursements?) Thanks, Brenda

Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.  Your rates are close enough as far as I'm concerned though. 
I came up with $2.60218 on Cook School Road for March and $2.93210 for April (using new fuel rate).  Maybe I'm calculating it wrong!  Tell me how you calculated it. For Nora I got the same rate you did $2.11 
I need to talk about how to handle CES storage in Sitara and Unify. The people that need to be their are Jeff, Mark, Victor, and one ot the CGAS schedulers.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow afternoon around 2:30 pm. Everyone else is more than welcome to attend.  Please let me know if you will be attending. I will schedule a conference room after I know who is attending.

My sources tell me this means NIMO will continue to assign CES CNG capacity unless CES can prove they have primary firm to NIMO.  What I'm not sure of is will NIMO start assigning CES the upstream Tetco capacity. Scott, who at CES worked with NIMO on the capacity elections? Molly LaFuze 03/10/2000 02:37 PM 
Does this affect us?  If so, how?  Thanks Chris. 
Hi Molly, I don't know if this will effect Enron or not - I don't even know if Columbia Energy had any firm capacity off of CNG released through NIMO, but just in case, I though you might like to know about this. Sorry I am not much of a help here. Thanks! 
March 10, 2000 SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION: In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment. If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity to you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March, 2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of April. If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me at 315-460-4041.  Thank you. Janice Bailey Manager Transportation Services Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation

Hey fellas, I'm going to a meeting in your building tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.  If time allows, I would like to stop by and visit each of you after the meeting. I've never seen your workstations (?) before. ii 
We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.  The volume is 34,248 dts and the price is $2.22. I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a wholesale transaction. 
There is a sale to CES for a volume of 34,248 dts, deal 149430.  It has your name on it.  My conterpart at CES does not recognize it.  According to Unify the downstream k# is 94946.  If you did this deal, do you remember who you did the deal with? Thanks. 
We parked gas (deal 240072) on the 8th and the 9th and we are pulling it out (deal 240073) on the 10th.  ENA will pay Transco $.055 times the daily 
This is more CNG fuel waiver stuff.  Thanks

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need to do is send CNG a letter  requesting; ""Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011"". If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts. Let me know if you have any questions. thanks 
The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and transmission contracts moved over. Comments/questions?

I havn't worked on any of the April pricing in the system yet.  I'm working fast and furious on March.  I was going to do most of April next week with Molly.  Can I give it to you then? Also, we can waive the 25% undertake limit on Texas Gas and Algonquin if you are ok with that.  Just let me know.  I also mentioned the intra day storage change to Dick Jenkins.  I need to chat with Dick and Colleen about the storage.  For now, I will allow the intra day changes. cdalpho@columbiaenergygroup.com on 04/06/2000 07:10:14 AM

OK this is metered production on CNG. Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with. The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES production. After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal in Sitara with a zero volume. 
If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool). If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production or pool gas on CNG? 
Hey John, did CES take this gas for Jan, Feb, and Mar?  Wade would like to see this deal in the system. 
T&F Operating has sent ENA a ""breach of contract"" letter and is requesting to terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000. Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer. CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999. T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either. T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive any and all ""cover"" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to April 1, 2000. John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question. 
I took the volume on deal 226742 (Devonian Resources) to 0 for April. Hey John, give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this. 
Hey dudes, we need someone to attend this.  I'm thinking Scott Goodell should go.  Let's chat. 
We need to decide who is going ASAP and book our rooms and flights. Cindy Burnette (TCO Rep), said TCO will be covering new capacity release and ""in the path issues"". It will also touch on ORDER 637, Thanks

As part of that Docket, several transmission lines were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification. On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines. The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at (304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262. April 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00 11:10 am Posted 4/3/00 11:10 am Dear Pool Operator: CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires that the ""wet gas"" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in. The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area. Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT considering the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your pool. As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify producers individually. We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled shut       down will not be until 2002. If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to contact me at (304) 623-8698. Sincerely, Nancy M.

I segmented the rest of our Tetco capacity this morning effective the 4th. Please update your morning sheet with new AN52's. 
Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May. This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us. I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the space if we don't have to. Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management group. 
I need to check on this.  I need to make sure we are not paying for this.  If it turns out to be retail, I will make sure I give CES credit for the transport. jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/31/2000 08:16:24 AM 
Just found out that we have acces to 15,000 of Aritech's capacity on TCO for Apr & May, for $0.01, primary COH 3-15. Can we replace capacity ENA bought for 4/1 and would there be any cost?

Hey guys.  I was in surgery Friday, everything went OK.  I'm only here 1/2 day today and it's pretty much caos today because the whole gas department changed floors over the weekend.  Let me know if there are any issues we need to address right away. Charlie, I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance. 
Hey, you should see us up here.  We are real nice and close.  I was out Friday and we moved from 31 to 32.  The schedulers are up here with us, although we are so far apart, you still need to use the squawk box to chat 
Transco Beverly has all the numbers.  Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit as Enron North America tomorrow morning and execute the 4 segments listed. Beavy has the offer numbers.  We will have (hopefully) 115,000 dt's of pure 3-3 segmented capacity, all on k#.7537. Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next Wed. Tetco We ran out of credit on ECT.  Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in the morning.  Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be executed.  AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.  Kathy, you might be able to do this too. Dan, I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity.  Remember, we did release 3500 dts of Ela to M2 to IGS. CNG We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April.  I just never got around to requesting them. Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 41101) to the following meters NIMO East 20550, NIMO West 20500, East Ohio 20100, NYSEG 20700, RG&E 20600, and Hanley & Bird 21100.  I left her a voicemail to call you.  Ask her if we can send in the paperwork next week.  Let Scott Hendrickson, Robin, and Dick know what fuel waivers CNG approves.  I have all the CNG contracts on the worksheet.

Hi Team!  I will be out of the office on Friday, March 31st.  Please call Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 with any questions you may have. 
Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non bidable.  Scott, it looks recallable.  Its parcel number 28464.  Vol=7500, receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.  The rate is $2.40 = $.08. Everything looks good except the recallable factor. Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446. I can't get my machine to print out the forms. 
Hi team.  Guess what day it is??!! 
Hey team!  I probably won't be here when these are due.  After you finish working on the sheet, print one copy for Kim Brown. Thanks :) 
I have some suggested Gas Daily pricing on the attached.  I will discuss this with Charlie.

We have decided to make Texas Gas Zone 4 an ""East"" desk pipe as oppossed to ""Market East"".  Please let me know if you think there might be any problems.

Hi gang.  I'm fairly certain I entered this parking deal wrong for Feb.  We will have to look at it next week. Deal 162283 and 162282.  We parked gas at S. Commack on Iroq and I think the counterparty should be CPR Exchange as opposed to Iroquois. 
You are most welcome even though you are too much of a tight wade to buy my capacity. 
There were pretty good.  Thanks, I needed that!  md

The following CES deals should roll into April 2000: Allied Signal  ipp   Sell for 3405/day gms # s-alliedsignal-0034  ends 11/1/2001  sitara # 145328 PennFuel citygate  Sell for 5000/day gms # s-pennfuel-0001  ends 11/1/2000 sitara # 151759 PennFuel citygate  Sell for 2610/day gms# s-pennfuel-0002  ends 11/1/2000 Boonville citygate  Sell for 130/day  gms# s-boonville-0012  ends 7/1/2000 sitara # 166857 Chris and Scott, please check the term and pricing, and correct the deal tickets. I did verify these tickets are not on the new Marketeast Desk. Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I would like to see the tickets for deals 100093 and 100096. 
Created deal # 231048 to net out against Z6 sales on 527 a day. 
Please review the following discrepancy and let me know what the price should be. 
Chris, Per my phone message, please see below. Thanks, Stephanie x33465 
Customer is short paying on deal 157848.  ENA billed 72,500 @ $2.76 and customer is paying at rate of $2.649.  As per Dcaf and Sitara rate should be IF-CGAS-Appalachia-MI which is equal ot $2.76.  Please confirm rate for this deal. Thank you, Jeff

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated. The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point. The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back. Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317 - 03-28-00 daily vols AM.xls

Look at deals 99663 and 229143 for CNG/Sabine center contract I00059.  We did this exact setup on several contracts today. Sylvia A Campos 03/28/2000 04:09 PM 
Chris, Will you have the same contract # and the same Pipeline under Market East and East in the same month?  If so, this would mean 2 different Global Nos. and that would create a problem downstream.  Please advise. Sylvia Chris Germany 03/28/2000 03:50 PM 
Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, and Tenn will be set up under both desk. All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East. Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same contract under both desk. Comments/questions? 
All very good questions and NO, we don't have an anwser. Brenda H Fletcher 03/28/2000 05:18 PM 
Can you answer Melba's question below regarding the new desk? 
Thanks for the info!  Do you know what the key is to make sure the tickets show up in Unify on the right desk?  Also how do we assure flash is on right desk or is this not going to be an issue if we are using the Service P & l to flash?  If we use the Service P & L to flash, will the transport info in Unify and the flash amts. be the same and on the same desk?  How this makes sense! Brenda H Fletcher 03/28/2000 04:16 PM

This contract number appears twice on the Service List in Path Manager with different deal numbers ( 151880 & 156569). Is this duplication in error and should one be killed  ?  The rate schedule is FSS.  I couldn't find demand expense for this contract on the invoice. Is this a pipeline error ? Thanks, Brenda

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party gives 90 day written notice to end the contract. I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of you is it? I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this. 
We borrowed (deal227922) about 22,000 dt from CNG for the 28th and we will pay it back (deal 227926) on the 29th.  ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the daily balance on the 28th.  This gets confusing because we already have a parking 
Mary Theresa Franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff.  She and I will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 12:30.  Actually, you could set the priorities for us.  What should we work on first? 
Are you planning on working on the gathering contracts or is someone else going to enter? Chris Germany 03/27/2000 12:07 PM 
I would change it to an IT gathering contract.  I didn't know we had any firm gathering in the Market area.  And currently, I am not working on the other gathering contracts. Brenda H Fletcher 03/27/2000 11:53 AM 
The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the pipeline? Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb. Are you working on getting contracts and deals added? Thanks, Brenda

Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have made the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes. As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and as I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm basis with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the price for all of the  April storage injections.

We parked 25,000 dt/day on the 25th-27th (deal 225515) on CNG and we will be taking it out during April (deal 225534).  ENA will pay CNG $.02 x 75,000 dt = $1,500.00 in April. Please let me know if you have questions.

Hey Pops!  Here is the deal.  If you can verify that you recieved this message, you can have Jerry's jet ski.   That's right, its FREE!!  Just call 
Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets. I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES. Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct? 
Chris, Status on this? Thanks. S Chris Germany 03/16/2000 10:26 AM 
Dick, I don't have this deal in my records as a sale to CES.  When you get back, let's look at your deal sheet and see if there are any notes. 
Can you check with Dick Jenkins on this, please. He was my contact on this. Thanks man. Chris Germany 03/15/2000 01:13 PM 
I spoke with Brian at CES .  He does not show this deal in his records.  I don't show it in my records either. Sandra Dial 03/14/2000 11:11 AM 
Yes, I have an invoice. I'll bring to you this p.m (I was out yesterday). S Chris Germany 03/13/2000 10:03 AM 
Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio?  I would like to see it if we do.  I don't show any record of a deal like this.  I'm going to send an email to my CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this. 
Sandra, I just have to get with Chris Germany to see if he can confirm this deal. I will keep you posted. Thanks, Rob Chris, Deal # 153683, Please take a look at this and see if you can confirm that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no market. Thanks Victor Lamadrid 03/10/2000 03:21 PM 
Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and replace with this purchase. Sandra Dial 03/10/2000 01:33 PM 
Stephanie, Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase. Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it. Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he needs to get this pathed in the system. Thanks all. Sandra x5-7213 
The deal ticket has 2001 on it not 2000. Can you find out who they sold the gas to. Do you need this pathed and tracked and balanced? - Rob Sandra Dial 03/10/2000 09:54 AM 
Robert/Victor, Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call from Mark Feldman from Volume)... Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks. S x5-7213

Hey Jennifer and Dale, I checked with Scott Neal and Dick Jenkins and they're on board with having all 4 trading locations available for our customers starting April on EOL (if possible with you guys of course).  The 2 existing locations are CNG SABINE NORTH POINT & CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will be CNG TRANSMISSION TTT SOUTH POOL & CNG TRANSMISSION TTT NORTH POOL.   There may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to these points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the 4 points.    The Enron trader responsible for the 2 new CNG Transmission locations will be Scott Hendrickson.  The business systems director at CNG Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King.  Her phone number is 304-623-8213 and her e-mail is iris_g._king@cngt.cng.com.  She is also onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as possible. If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know.   THANKS AGAIN IN ADVANCE!!!!!!

I changed the volume on the deal to 15,324 dts. Charlie, this is a deal Dick Jenkins did with John.  ENA is buying this gas from CES at GD - $.005 Let me know if you have questions. 
This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied. mainline to leach to allied = 12809/12426/12163 tco pool to allied  = 2898/2837 Total delivery cut  = 12163+2837 = 15,000 Total at pool  = 12426+2898 = 15,324 By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the 15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal ticket is 225366. Thanks Joan Veselack 03/23/2000 03:56 PM

Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke  pricing has me curious.  Do I need to check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals? I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's GMS system.  Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about the deals.  I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals in Sitara. 
According to the CES Data Room book, the price on this deal is IF CGAS + .015.  I changed it in Sitara effective Jan 1, 2000 - Nov 30, 2001. 
Robin, Tom Clark at PG&E called and is not taking the 4400/day for April 2000. Chris and Scott, please check deal ticket 145312 for correct pricing. The CES deal term date  is 12/1/98 to 12/1/2001 and gms # is s-roanoke-2746. I extended the Enron deal ticket to match the CES deal term. Not sure what the pricing should be. Thanks.

Yuck!  Some of this looked spooky.  Baseball tickets:  you and your buddy Maureen go to the game on Tuesday, June 6th.  I believe the Astro's play MIN. 
Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year round.  This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand during the summer.  Depending on the relationship you would like to have with the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport (at least with the way things work in our systems). 
Paulette, It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT 60 payment. Enron would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire transfers. Thanks again for your patience. pheuer@EdisonMission.Com on 03/23/2000 05:45:18 PM 
Joan, The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was never CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed February's bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have January and February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account? Thanks! Paulette Joan.Veselack@enron.com on 03/23/2000 06:08:57 PM 
Roman and Paulette, Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday March 24th. As soon as Mark Feldman (Enron payment God) receives February's bill, he can pay this one too. Thank you for your patience during this transition. 
I think so.  I believe several people will be here on the 1st.

I entered the sale to Allegheny in Sitara (deal 224977) effective 4/1/200 thru 10/31/2000. Dick, Scott, the sales price is trigger deal priced at  NX1 + $.22. Allegheny holds the trigger and the daily volume is 1,532 day at Leach or the CGAS pool. My contact at Allegheny is Nat Miljus (phone 412-394-2953). David is going to make me fill out a term ticket and I'm running it through Dick's book.

CES is swinging on Tennessee deliveries at Brookshire.  We have sale 207146 priced at IF.  Should we be doing a buy back at GD instead of IF? Scott 
Is Dayton showing the price to be 1.  $2.47 and $2.455 2.  $2.47 +.17 and $2.455 + .17? To me it looks like options 2. Enron North America Corp. 
What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the rate is $.01?  Who did this deal? The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I entered it in Sitara deal 223022. 
i added deal 223021, cglf k#66281 for feb to sitara.  what is this capacity 
Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal.  She laughed when I said gave her the volume of 100,000.  The most she will consider is 50,000.  So I told her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in demand charges each month.  She needs to think about it.  I'm out tomorrow but I will call her. Also, we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed 
Steve will find out what the pricing is and will let me know. 
That's ok.  I need to buy back  the gas CES is not taking.  I think that will be easier to do after the month is over.  I will calculate the volume and pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with CES on the last day of the month. Joe A Casas 03/21/2000 04:16 PM 
Chris, do u want me 2 change the dpl tkt? 
DPL has issued an OFO for Thursday the 23rd and Friday the 24th.  I will need to adjust my volumes as follows: 23rd - cut volume of 1203 to 883 dth on TGT K# 6057 24th - cut volume of 1203 to 823 dth on TGT K# 6057 Effective the 25th - 31st, please keep my volumes at 1203 dth per day. DPL may revise the OFO - in the event of a revision, Marianne Stiles is aware of the changes that need to be made.  I will be out of the office Wed. afternoon and all day Friday. 
I'm out tomorrow and if I win the Lotto tomorrow nite, Mr. Goodell will be a busy fellow.  I think I visit Tahitti jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/21/2000 03:22:27 PM

The far right column is winter and next to that is summer 
I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find. CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648 I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the worksheet. 
That's all good and well buy where is my Diet Coke??? Joan Veselack@ENRON 03/21/2000 12:24 PM 
This deal is starting to get confusing.... so here is the whole deal effective 3/21 to 3/31. gulf / leach/coh 22-3 38011/46 8979/8711/8527 51875/25 3657/3548/3473 60599/7  3159/3065/3000 63895/6  3686/3576/3500 63895/8  0/1917/1876  This piece from TCO pool. No contracts are currently overrun. Cindy/Kathy/Jesse - we are pulling 19481 from your p20 pool on contract 63895, which max's out the contract. Any additional Aristech coh 22-3 sale will  have to be from TCO pool. Kara - we are delivering to coh 22-3 as follows: 38011 = 8527 51875 = 3473 60599 = 3000 63895 = 5376 John - I have 550,154 being pulled from p20 for the month. I hope that ties to your number. I cannot pull any additional gas from p20, because this would overrun your FTS1 contract. The 1 dkt SIT can be made up from Enron's TCO pool. Please verify that this is okay. I'll schedule it for 3/23 gas day. Thank you everyone for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chris Germany@ECT 03/21/2000 09:40 AM 
I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st. Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool (deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt. 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline. 1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool. Price = $2.77 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach .0250  demand charge --------- 2.8995 CGAS price. Please let me know if you have any questions.

For the balance of March, CNG has granted ENA fuel waivers from Iroq/Canajoharie to the following CNG citygates; NIMO (East & West), NYSEG, and Hanley & Bird.  According to this morning's sheet, we are delivering about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points. Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie. 1.  Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.  At today's prices we save: Savings Tenn Variable $.0491   at $3.00 CNG Fuel $.0672  at  $2.88 ------------ Total Savings $.1151 At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100, we should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie 2.  Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.  We save the CNG fuel cost.  This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of $.04 to $.06.

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party gives 90 day written notice to end the contract. I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of you is it? 
I don't know if you ever got copies of the invoices.  Everything given to me for you guys was actually wholesale stuff.  However, I getting copies as I work on actualizing the demand charge sheet for Jan.  I will make copies an send them to Brian. 
I just  changed the demand charge on the Penn Fuel capacity from 6.53 to 6.423 (deal 205687).  I changed the price on the Penn Fuel released demand from 6.449 to 6.423 (deal 205672).  We were billed 6.423 in January.  That's

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several pipelines.  Who should I talk to? On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and sell the gas to CES on injections. On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how to do it. Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

The class is offered through Leisure Learning Unlimited.  Go to web site http://llu.com/  select Adventure Unlimited, click on the line beginning with Gun Safety (that's next by the way).  Then scroll down, it's in there somewhere.  Or you could just give me a call to find out more. Here is the schedule; Lecture:  Sat  10am-noon, outdoors Sat 1-4pm and Sun 10am-4pm, March 4th & 5th. The lecture is at the LLU office on Richmond close to Kirby, I think.  The outdoors session is in Addicks, I'm sure that's outside the loop somewhere. Cost:  $85.00 for the class and a $6.00 or $12.00 registration fee depending on which option you select. Oh yeah, I may need to borrow a hacksaw if Dan Junek signs up! 
I understand.  I'm involved because it may have been used to serve CES.  If we used it to serve CES, I should have called CES to negotiate a price and thats what I don't see in my records. Sandra Dial 03/16/2000 12:39 PM

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and replace with this purchase. Sandra Dial 03/10/2000 01:33 PM

Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email... as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can. Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.  Is it a problem that it wasn't March 15? Scott Colleen Sullivan@ECT 03/08/2000 08:43 AM 
The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it together. Joan Veselack@ENRON 03/07/2000 01:49 PM 
To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this contract work for April 1? If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate? Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition. Thanks for your help!!!

Brenda was able to obtain a copy of the CES Egan storage contract.  We don't have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ENA though.  We do have copies of the invoices for Jan and Feb.  The invoices are addressed to ENA which is good enough for me. I am going to set the contract up as an ENA contract effective Jan 1, unless someone has an objection.  Brenda will give a copy of the contract to Sylvia. Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.  Also, the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it up that way. Let me know if you have questions. thanks

My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now.  What's bad is CES has seen some of the pricing for the local production, I was going to bill them a lot more for it.  That does not mean they agree to the pricing. 
Chris, Find that local production list when you have a chance and forward it to me. Thanks. 
Nope.  Cove Point is a wholesale asset. Brenda H Fletcher 03/15/2000 08:06 PM

Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61. The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell him. I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport). 
CNG would like to stop by the office to do some TTT training next Wed, Thur, or Fri. Please let Marde know if you have a preference as to which day you would like to meet with CNG.  I may or may not be here. 
I took the Egan Storage demand charge to 0 in the CES Wholesale worksheet until David can determine it we have accounted for the charge someplace 
Attached is the storage schedule for CES. Scott, according to Colleen, this will take up a significant amount of someone's time to track. 
Chris - I wasn't sure who to send the storage schedules to, so I figured if I sent them to you and Colleen I'm covered.  Please give me a call if you have an questions. Thanks, Melissa

Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio?  I would like to see it if we do.  I don't show any record of a deal like this.  I'm going to send an email to my CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this. 
Sandra, I just have to get with Chris Germany to see if he can confirm this deal. I will keep you posted.

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and replace with this purchase. Sandra Dial 03/10/2000 01:33 PM

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he needs to get this pathed in the system. Thanks all. Sandra x5-7213

The deal is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks. S x5-7213

FYI 
We have had an unexpected death in my family, requiring me to be out of the office the rest of the week.   I am sorry the timing is so bad, I will contact Robert first thing next week and we can workout a game plan going forward.  Thanks for your patience... 
The contracts are the transportation agreements on CNR.  Robert sat with Chris Germany yesterday and to our knowledge these gathering contracts have never been set up in our systems. I'll be in meetings until 3:30, so please feel free to talk to Robert Allwein down on 30.  Actually, I think it would be a great idea to spend a few minutes talking about this to get on the same page before anyone gets too far into the process and we discover that rework is being done. MARY THERESA FRANKLIN 03/14/2000 01:35 PM 
I just meet with Gloria to decipher what the status is on all her E-mails. She's identified all the remaining rate changes needed for today's payments, the transport contracts needed to be setup, Sitara numbers needed for contracts already set up, and the meters needing to be linked to transport contracts.  I'm still fuzzy on this whole process and am not sure what Robert Allwein's 60 or 70 contracts relate to... are these purchase contracts? I'll be up shortly, working with Brenda... let's see if a meeting would be good. 
I'm a bad person.  I forgot to tell you I sold CES 880 to 1000 day at the pool starting tomorrow on deal 217775 Also, I just sold CES 2500/day at CGLF Mainline starting the 16th-31st, deal 217854.  This gas is for Atistech.  I assume we schedule that. Joan Veselack@ENRON 03/14/2000 12:58 PM 
Brian said the deal was done with Chris to use Enron's IPP. This has been scheduled. TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged. Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn from storage for  March. There is no need to do outside deals to get additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice. Thanks. bperron@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/14/2000 10:58:19 AM 
We are using #51407. Lee Tippett 03/14/2000 11:55 AM 
Please nominate the following volumes baseload for the rest of March starting on March 15, 2000: Using Orwell's contract #37962 please nominate 850/day from the pool you and Brian Perrone agree upon. Using Lakeside's contract #37979 please nominate300/day from the pool you and Brian Perrone agree upon. Please forward to JoAnne Collins if you would, I don't have her e address.

Hey - whats this ""was"" stuff???? Sherry Anastas 03/14/2000 12:38 PM 
Chris, It was going to be one set of invoices. Sherry 
Were you just sending me the invoices as you get them or was it a box of invoices at one time? 
Did you ever send CES copies of the demand charges for Jan 2000.  My contact, 
Hi gang.  You guys may or may not be interested in this.  The files ""febsaleinv1.xls"" and ""febsaleinv2.xls"" are excel formats of ENA's invoice to CES for the month of Feb.  The ""2000ces02.xls"" file is where Goodell and I keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport pricing.  There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.  I use the data in this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.  It is a completly manual process. I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the pricing (excellent performance review stuff).  I do want to go over the data in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly. Thanks. 
Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the ""febsaleinv2.xls"" file. I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.  I will try to touch base with you later today. Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the ""2000ces02.xls"" worksheet. 
Kim is taking care of that invoice. 
Occasionally, when I have a question, I call my little EES buddies to get a better understanding of a specific LDC.  I don't mention CES and I assume that's ok. 
I'm going to respond to everyone on the email with my comments but I just wanted to make sure I undersand the blue highlighted comments below.  Please call me when you get a chance. Thanks Joan Veselack@ENRON 03/13/2000 01:06 PM 
Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES?  This could be a can of worms. Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the official word. Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating. However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments. 
Nope.  It probably should.  It would also be flashed as a reimbursement. Scott Goodell@ENRON 03/13/2000 02:41 PM 
Does the 2000ces01, 2000ces02, 2000ces03 transport get flashed? Should the Sonat capacity appear on CES or 2000trans? Scott 
1.  The index premium of $.032 is correct. 2.  Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader.  You should ask one of those 3 people. Enron North America Corp. 
Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the ""febsaleinv2.xls"" file. I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.  I will try to touch base with you later today. Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the ""2000ces02.xls"" worksheet. 
I think we are good to go. 
Robert, I changed the volumes on the CES buy/sale deals 204462 and 204471.  I just entered a volume for the last day of the month.  You don't need to do this right away, when you get a chance go into Unify for Feb and show an actual volume of 0 for the 25th - 28th and a volume of 991014 for the 28th. Then retrack and balance. Jeff, I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you.  You 
Do we currently have any Mountaineer or West Virginia production? 
Brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  Do you show anything in your records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?  It looks like a 1 day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.  The delivery point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.  The price would be 
Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio?  I would like to see it if we do.  I don't show any record of a deal like this.  I'm going to send an email to my CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this.

As of  March 8, 2000,  the Storage Gas Balance for Contract 530586 was 2,944 dekatherms or 21%  full. CNG Transmission Corporation ?s (CNGT) Rate Schedule GSS,  Section 8.4 provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 16%, then CNGT?s obligation to make deliveries from storage shall be reduced by 30%. Therefore, when Storage Gas Balance falls below 16% or 2,236 dekatherms,  CNGT?s obligation to make deliveries from this storage account shall be reduced from 210 dekatherms to 160 dekatherms. Please review,  monitor, and if necessary, adjust the storage withdrawals to avoid overruns and the resulting penalties as provided in Section 35.3B of the General Terms and Conditions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 304-623-8546. 
Hey.  What is your professional opinion about this?  This was sent to me by my scheduler.  I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO capacity on CNG, NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each month.  True? March 10, 2000 SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION: In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment. If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity to you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March, 2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of April. If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me at 315-460-4041.  Thank you. Janice Bailey Manager Transportation Services Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation

Just a note to let you know Columbia Gas has some capacity postings on the EBB for next winter.  BIDS ARE DUE 3/15 AT 9AM. Attached is a spreadsheet showing the parcel numbers.  I highlighted the meters that you did not have enough capacity to serve your load this winter. I would be happy to bid on this as your agent, but let me know what rate works based on your economics.  This is a bid process, so the current low bid is just an indication of the market value of the capacity. Scott

Jeff Porter and I have discussed this several times over the last week. 
The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it together. Joan Veselack@ENRON 03/07/2000 01:49 PM 
To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this contract work for April 1? If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate? Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition. Thanks for your help!!!

Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the 2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to Sitara.

Hey! 
CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the January transaction is complete. Here are my questions/comments; 1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange. I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC. If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the new deal.  Please let me know ASAP. 2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment was due. 3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it above, where do we put the $.65 fee at? 4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who should he talk to about that?? Please forward this email to others that may need to see it. Thanks

Kate left us a bid form for NYSEG capacity.  For CNG, I would prefer to have the Cornwell space.  I think the South Webster goes with Tenn Z4. Dick, other than CES, do you know what our CNG citygate positions are 
Opps.  Wrong worksheet 
This is what I have.  Good luck.

Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.  I remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.  Could you path those deals and email Mark when you are done. Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify after Meredith paths the gas.  Just a note, we will probably be billed 
I'm not wild about Dodge either only because it is a Chrysler product.  Kevin is actually the one that mentioned that one. Chris Germany@ECT 03/07/2000 12:06 PM 
I have mixed comments on Dodge's.  I think either of the other vehicles are perfect.

I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance, stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.  Jerry was taking the class with me.  He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..  If I was sitting in a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot was facing North East. I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the Dr. told them to take me to ""a very quiet room"".   He popped my foot back in place and sent me to x-ray.  I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments are probably all torn up.  I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.  Right now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support. I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks. What are you looking for in a truck? 
I just heard that rumor.  What happened? Chris Germany@ECT 03/07/2000 09:23 AM 
I luv trucks.  I was injured on Sunday,  I use crutches now.

Do you know if anyone in my office is using this on a daily basis? dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/07/2000 09:01:46 AM 
Chris--The attached spreadsheet contains our Daily volume requirements for 3/7 and 3/8 (except for the AGL numbers).   For 3/7 you will see two 'NOM' Columns--one labelled '9AM' and one labelled 'Intraday' which is an update of the requirements reported in the 9AM column.   The two columns will be identical in instances where no change has been made.   Where the two numbers differ, the Intraday value is the latest requriement.  In some cases where there is storage (i.e., COH Choice) , you will see negative values for the 'PRIMARY' requirement.  This represents a situation where gas is being withdrawn from storage and sold at the pool, along with the first-of-the-month baseload daily 'PRIMARY' volume. Please call if you have questions, etc. Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317 - 03-07-00 Daily Vols.xls

FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me know if anyone wants a copy of the letter. Thanks, HG 
Who wuz receiving the bills on contracts 2.6598 and 2.6592 in December?  Wuz it CES or Union Camp?

This is just about my intelluctual speed. Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. You move like the bass which excite me in May. You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. Ye're as fragrant as ""snuff"" right out of the can. You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. Some men, they git roses fer that special day, From the cooler at Kroger. ""That's impressive,"" I say. Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. ""Diamonds is ferever,"" they explains, suave and couth. But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. I got you a gift,without taste or odor, More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

Just a note.  Effective April 1st, we will not have the purchase at St 85 or the PSNC transport.  This is a new contract each month - we are currently shipping 145 dt's. 
Chris, Please see below. 
Good Afternoon. Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany.  We have one customer at PSNC.  Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this customer as their expires.  I just do not want to have a mix up for April and have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed.  I am in the process of notifing PSNC.  Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give you the option to inform Chris. 
Chris--The attached file contains our daily requirements for 3/6 and 3/7. Please call me if there is a problem with scheduling the volumes indicated. The AGL numbers in this spreadsheet may not be correct and the numbers provided by David Scott to Scott Goodell for today and tomorrow should be used instead of the ones shown here.   Later today, around 4PM eastern time, I will send you an update if there are any changes. Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317 - 03-06-00 Daily Vols.xls 
Here are a couple of demand charges I don't understand.  AGL released CES some ESR (offer #18307) and WSR (offer #18210).  The demand portion of these 
Just to keep you in the loop.  I have not responed to any of these questions yet.

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you please assist? 1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25 2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details on this K. 3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details. 4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail. 5.  CNG NORTH- K#'s 5A2291/5A2181 and 5A2292/5A2182; deliveries to NIMO, CES's or ENA's? 6.  Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below 7.  TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details. 8.  TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA? 9.   Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also? 10. Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned? Call me if you have questions. Jeff 703/561-6447 
Hey Team!  Ms.  ""Terry"" Franklin is part of the team now.  Make sure you copy her on any appalachian/local production issues.  She will be the one setting this up in Sitara in the future. Thanks. 
I called Jill Linkenauger Friday afternoon... haven't heard back. My plan is to talk to her and then Kevin McCracken at CNR to have this agency switch over by April 1st. I thought it was done... but not 100% sure. Robert Allwein@ECT 03/06/2000 07:25 AM 
Hey cats. Sylvia needs to know if we are agent for CES regarding CNR contracts. I began setting up the contracts on Friday, but she stopped me in the middle cuz she wants to make sure that we are setting them up correctly. I have 50 to 70 to set up. Please let me know what you know. - Thanks, Rob 
Scott misspelled your name.  I hope I have the right guy. I listed one of the CES issues down below.  The other issue I have is pricing.  I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the pricing.  I will try to get with you this afternoon.  Just a note, I bet I spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday. Thanks cg 
I talked with Hunter.  Kevin Rosetti is the man.  Chris, please bring up to speed on how to handle CES. Chris Germany 03/02/2000 03:08 PM 
I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues. CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue. Comments?

You left 2 TRCO invoice questions on my desk. 1.  Contract 3.3558 - this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail. The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe. 2.  Contract 3.3509 - ???  I don't understand this one.  Take a look at k#1.3473.  Did we receive a demand charge on 1.3473 and not have the demand estimated in Sitara?  I may need to add 1.3473 and 0 3.3509.  Let me know 
I think this is a Central Desk contract or its one of our agency contract. We have so many.  Do you have a Sitara deal number? 
Please see below and advise on the effective date for contract #1000103 or should this contract not be used for January business? Thanks, Sylvia 
Let's see.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say ""let me know if there is anything I can do to help"" get those invoices out. Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean ""I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing 
Chris, lets meet next Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. (Conference Room EB-3745) to discuss the status of the January 2000 invoice billing (sales & purchase). There is still a substantial amount that is not showing up  in Unify. Customer is paying Enron $28 million on Monday and we only have $11 million in the system that is showing up. We sent Columbia a manual invoice for $16,972,671.72 and a system generated invoice of $11,477,340.49 on Friday February 18th. Send me an e-mail back to confirm. Thanks, Jeff

Chris--Can you please provide me with a response to Kim's question? Thanks. 
Hi.  Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st.  I had requested 145 dth per day on Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler.  For some reason Chris Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth.  PSNC called me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled.  I instructed PSNC to contact Chris.  Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth on the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second.  I did this. This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March 1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed.  I called my transco scheduler and she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled. (impossible as capacity was released to Enron).  All I wanted was 145 dth per day for March.  Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should and did get scheduled?  Thank you. 
Robin did a buy/sale on algo for tomorrow only.  Match deal 211356 with 211359. 
we need to determine if he will be the point person.  need to check with scott, but it appears that someone should attend. 
I sold 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES (Aristech) at CGLF/Mainline (deal 210987). 
She's still a porker as of this morning. Anne Bertino@EES 03/03/2000 08:44 AM 
Chris, Has Judy had her baby?  Her due date is today so I was wondering.  Have a great weekend. Anne 
Joe, it looks like we have already had some buy/sale activity.  I'm not touching until you and I chat.  I will talk to my counterpart this afternoon. 
I'm going to change the sell to CES on Monday for now.  I will chat with my CES counterpart this afternoon about how to treat this. Joe A Casas 03/03/2000 09:26 AM 
Just rec'd a call from Kim Novsek  w/ changes for DPL.   From 1203 to 903 for 3/6, to 943 on 3/7, and to 863 on 3/8. thanx

Done.  Deal 210603 I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge.  When Dana does her voodoo stuff, this deal will show up. Ms.  Franklin, this might be my last contract to set up (he he he <=== evil snicker!). Robert Allwein 03/03/2000 07:30 AM 
Hey Chris, CES/CNR Contract 515. Can you set this up just like the other CNR contracts that you have set up in the past.. Please set up for Jan 1 start date. Deal # 77283 is a CNR contract that you can copy. If this is something you can get me to do, let me know. I have approximately 70 contracts that need to be set up very soon for CNR. Wade is starting to pay the Jan invoices. Thank you, Rob

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues. CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team. In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following: ? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements ? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results ? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts ? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters ? Create purchase deals in SITARA ? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc. ? Review calc sheets ? Maintain purchase pricing ? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very important area. Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during this transition time. Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you eliminate segmenting. Example #1 Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery point of PECO in Z6. What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios; PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from Tetco/Ragley to Z6? PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to Z6? Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.

February 29, 2000                                       Received 2/29/00 11:30 am Posted 2/29/00  11:30 am Dear Producers and Shippers, In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed. Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until: 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you. If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705. Sincerely, H. Dale Rexrode Director, Producer Services

Good news, even better when it happens.  My contract at CES, Brian Perrone, just told me CES will pay the invoice we billed them.  They still need to reconstruct January. Billing I still need to work on January capacity and sales to CES. I found a significant amount of transport I left out of January.  I want to fix the Feb capacity sheet and bill CES tomorrow or Fri for capacity and the scheduling fee. 
Jeff Porter is the CES person responsible for looking at their transport. Last week, he said he was working on their transport numbers.  Also,

Latest and greatest. 
Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would be met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1, our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable for penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary and keep drawing the gas out of storage. Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further. Scott.Goodell@enron.com on 02/28/2000 04:46:35 PM Please respond to Scott.Goodell@enron.com 
Doug- Based on these numbers David's w/d from IBSS would be zero, due to the AGL DSR. Scott Chris Germany@ECT 02/25/2000 11:53 AM 
Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00. There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes), the spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were only picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the attached version. Sorry for any confusion.

CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th.  To keep the deal tickets simple, I am showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the month CGAS price. Joe, I created a purchase from CES (deal 202576).  Match this up with 600dth of deal 159319. We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on the 24th. I will let you know if things change. bperron@columbiaenergygroup.com on 02/22/2000 10:34:30 AM 
Chris, We are going to redirect 3600 dths off of Texas Gas from CG&E to TCO Pool.  600 dths/day will be delivered at Lebanon starting Thursday, February 24. Please let me know if there are any questions or problems. Brian

Chris--At this date, CES has a large overhang of storage inventory on AGL. To address this situation, I have asked David Scott to increase our IBSS withdrawals to the maximum daily withdrawal quantities for the rest of February.   Moreover, we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on the directly assigned storage services for the rest February.    We don't want gas injected into storage unless it is necessary to avoid a penalty.   David will contact Scott about the Directly Assigned storage withdrawals. To the extent that maximizing our storage withdrawals requires us to cut back on flowing gas, the cuts in flowing gas will be sold back to ENA  per our contract. Please call me if you have questions, etc. Thanks. Doug Kinney Ph:  703-561-6339 Fax:  703-561-7317 
I knew we would have to address this eventually. CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.  I showed them a $2.66 bid for tomorrow.  Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into CGAS at Lebanon. This gets real messy.  Is there any way we can refuse this?  At first, I was thinking we would have to do this.  Now, I don't like the idea because it

My worksheet has a lot of support for the pricing we billed for January. Take a look at the worksheet and give me a call.  We probably will not be able to cover everything at once. We still have a few items to bill.  I will let you know what those items are and when we expect to bill them. 
Does any of this impact the Central Desk? 
Chris, As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit a number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers. We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can take March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron. I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available. Thanks, Melissa 
FYI, not the markets I was hoping to see.
