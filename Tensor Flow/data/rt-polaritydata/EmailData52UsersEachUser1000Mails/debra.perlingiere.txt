Vonda,=20 These are the changes that Enron Legal would like you to consider.  Please = review and let me know if these changes are acceptable. These changes would= be be inserted and would replace the sections under Demand Charge, Transac= tion Default Price, Reference Price and Flexible Pricing. I know.......let me know what you think.=20 Thanks Demand Charge for Physical Call Option Buyer shall pay Seller $0.03 per MMBtu multiplied by the FMDQ, plus fuel, m= ultiplied by the number of days in the Month of Delivery. Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option =20 Daily Pricing means the ""Daily Midpoint"" price set forth in Gas Daily Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,= in the column ""Daily Price Survey"" under the listing applicable to the geo= graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele= vant gas day.  If there is no single ""Daily Midpoint"" price published for t= hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a ""Common"" range of prices u= nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average= of such ""Common"" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin= t"" price or ""Common"" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D= ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d= etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced= ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo= t Price can be determined. FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Customer= may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed = Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours re= questing any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled dur= ing selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request m= ust be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the = last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month. = A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible = Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit ""A"" ""Fixed Price"" means a fixe= d dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which = a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original C= ontract Price applicable to the Transaction.  ""Notwithstanding anything to = the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's acc= eptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmless= for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantity= of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quanti= ty of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without l= imitation events of Force Majeure. 
=20 Further to our conversation, below is language inadvertently excluded from= the Master Agreement.  Specifically concerning Section 4.1 (page 2) and  t= he Material Adverse Change found in the Appendix. Turning to page 2 of the Agreement, Article 4 Defaults and Remedies should= include the following language beginning in the middle of the section afte= r .....""contract for each such Transaction and .....(ii) =20 =20 (ii) ascertaining the associated costs and attorneys' fees.

Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty. We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a ""Spot Market"" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount. FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings.

4.5. Termination Offset.  Upon the designation or deemed designation of an= Early Termination Date, the Notifying Party may, at its option and in its = discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Affected Party by the N= otifying Party or any Affiliate of the Notifying Party under this Agreement= or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amou= nts Owed by the Affected Party to the Notifying Party or any of the Notifyi= ng Party's Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s),= instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of the Affected Party an= d the Notifying Party under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall= be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exerci= sed by the Notifying Party and/or the Notifying Party's Affiliates.  The No= tifying Party will give the Affected Party notice of any setoff effected un= der this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provid= ed that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the se= toff.  For purposes of this Section 4.5, ""Owed"" shall mean any amounts owed= or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have = been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  Amounts subje= ct to the setoff permitted in this Section 4.5 may be converted by the Noti= fying Party into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated a= t the rate of exchange at which the Notifying Party, acting in a reasonable= manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of= the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, the Noti= fying Party may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respec= t of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other wh= en the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section 4.5 shall be eff= ective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provi= ded under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without prejudice= and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of a= ccounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at any tim= e otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise). = Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in= this Section 4.5 are an integral part of the agreement between the parties= and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter int= o Transactions.  The parties further acknowledge that each is executing thi= s Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Sect= ion 4.5, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall recei= ve the benefits of this Section 4.5 and otherwise be bound as if such Affil= iates had entered into this Agreement as its relates to Section 4.5.  Notwi= thstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the N= otifying Party shall not be required to pay to the Affected Party any amoun= t under Section 4.5 until the Notifying Party receives confirmation satisfa= ctory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of i= ts counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever of the Affect= ed Party to make any payments to the Notifying Party or any of its Affiliat= es under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or u= ndertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fu= lly and finally satisfied.

Good Morning Bob and Happy Holidays to you - Hope things are going well with you and Enron North America (""ENA""). Earlier this week, I assumed a new role at Constellation Power Source, Inc., which will give the opportunity to ""reconnect"" with many of the contract administration and legal professionals I worked with during my years at MEGA. I look forward to working with you once again. In light of the upcoming addition to our wholesale energy business, this email confirms our request to establish a gas purchase and sale agreement between your organization and Constellation Power Source, Inc.(""CPS""). According to our business structure, our affiliate company in Houston, TX, Constellation Energy Source, Inc.(""CES""), was previously handling all of the wholesale natural gas business on behalf of our organization.  It is expected that CES will cease operations by April '01 and the wholesale gas trading activity will be conducted through our newly formed Gas Desk located within the CPS' offices in Baltimore, MD. I have already contacted CES in an attempt to gather contracts and determine whether an assignment or the termination and reissuing of a new agreement between us would be the most feasible mean to proceed with our gas trading activity in a timely fashion. ENA  has been identified by our Gas Desk as one of the potential counterparties for gas trading in the year 2001.  CPS will initiate gas trading as early as January 29th, 2001. Considering this, I am looking forward to receiving a copy of your master agreement for our review and consideration.  Such can be forwarded to me via email at the earliest convenience. I thank you in advance for your assistance and prompt response to our request and look forward to working with you in the near future.  Do not hesitate to contact me if there are any further inquiries to this request. I will make a note to follow up with you during the first week of January '01.

ENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT GUARANTY AGREEMENT This Guaranty Agreement (this ""Guaranty""), dated as of ________, is made and entered into between ________________, a ___________ corporation (""Guarantor ""), and ______________________, a _____________ ___________ (""Contract Party""). WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor (""Obligor""), are contemplating entering into an ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the ""Gas Contract""), (ii) Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract. NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, Guarantor agrees as follows: 1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract (the ""Obligations""); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas Contract (the ""Indemnity Period"").  With respect to any Claims threatened or filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, (ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, (v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and delivery. 2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed $_____________ (the ""Maximum Limit""); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or application of any collateral by Contract Party. 3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Obligor. 4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby WAIVES. 5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that: (i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity. 6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party, Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information described in Appendix ""1"" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in accordance therewith. 7.  NOTICE.  All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or sent by facsimile, as follows: To Guarantor: ________________ ________________ ________________ Facsimile:  _______ To Contract Party: ________________ ________________ ________________ Facsimile:  _______ Notice given by personal delivery or mail shall be effective upon actual receipt.

THIS GUARANTY SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.  Guarantor WAIVES all right to require marshaling of assets and liabilities, sale in inverse order of alienation, notice of disposition of collateral and notice of acceptance of this Guaranty.  The Transaction Procedures set forth in the Gas Contract are acknowledged and agreed to by Guarantor and Guarantor agrees not to contest the validity or enforceability of any Transaction entered into in accordance with the Transaction Procedures under applicable law relating to whether certain agreements are to be in writing or signed by the Party to be thereby bound.  No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived, supple-mented or terminated except in a writing signed by the parties hereto.

Regarding BC Utility,  I have discussed a GISB with Mr. Wong  and  we have been unable to come to agreement  due to their choice of law restriction. Because they are a utility they are by statute required to bind agreements subject to  British Columbia.   Conversely as this would be an agreement subject to state laws of Texas as well as the United States,  it will not work to agree to British Columbia as jurisdiction for this contract. Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can be of further assistance. Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

With regards to our discussion on priority of contracts for 30 day firm transactions.  The system gives priority to Master Agreements over GISBs. All things equal,  a 30 day firm transaction will attach to the master before the GISB. Hope this helps. dp Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

Marcia, Thank you for your e-mail regarding SP's to the purposed GISB.  My responses are as follows: Section 1.   We will agree to your suggest  language. Netting:  We suggest the following: In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting,  in which case the party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount shall pay to the other party the difference between the amounts owed. Adequate Assurance:   We will agree to 5 business days. Term:  For firm delivery limit the use of the GISB to 30 days.  For interruptible delivery there is no limit. We  will agree to the above along with our other SP's as written.  Thanks for your attention to the foregoing.  Please let me have your thoughts. Regards, Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp.

Dear WEN Members-2000: We have not received your 2001 membership applications.  You are in danger of being dropped from the membership directory for 2001 and from receiving monthly luncheon notices.  Please send in your application for 2001 (see attached form) and your $30 membership dues AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! In the past, the WEN Board has sent you a copy of the monthly luncheon meeting notice and the bi-monthly newsletter by both e-mail and regular mail.  The WEN Board recently voted to discontinue sending notices by regular mail.  Beginning with this e-mail message, you will receive future meeting notices and the WEN newsletter by e-mail only.  Those members for whom we do not have an e-mail address will continue to receive their notices by regular mail. Keeping the above in mind, please make sure that you print the attached meeting notice as an extra reminder to yourself to sign up for the luncheon since you won't be receiving the hard copy in the mail.  We hope that you approve of this method.  If you have friends in mind that you think would be interested in attending our next luncheon on February 14, please forward the attached luncheon notice to them. Additionally, the Board also voted to begin publishing the WEN newsletter on a quarterly basis rather than bi-monthly.  We look forward to sending you your next newsletter in April. For your information, we will be sending a survey to you in the near future to gather your input about suggestions for making WEN even better.  We value your opinion, so your responses to the survey will be greatly appreciated. Don't forget that we will be having a Networking Happy Hour for all WEN members on Thursday, February 1, at Mesa Grill, 1971 W. Gray (713-520-8900) beginning at 5 p.m.  Hope to see you there!

Debra, I am sorry for the long delay in responding.  In regard to the HPL agreement, we'd like to submit a few requested changes for your consideration, as follows: 1. Article 1.  Term.  We'd like to amend the initial term from one year to one month. 2. Section 3.2 Subsections(i)& (ii).  Seller's Failure to Schedule.  In the seventh line immediately after the word ""the"", delete the words ""Replacement Price Differential, plus (ii) liquidated damages equal to $0.15"" and replace with the words ""Gas Daily Price"".  In line nine immediately after the word ""Quantity"", delete the words ""to cover Buyer's administrative and operational costs"" so these 2 subsections now read as follows: (i)an amount equal to the product of the Seller's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the Gas Daily Price multiplied by Seller's Deficiency Quantity"". 3. Section 3.4 Subsections (i) & (ii).  Buyer's Failure To Deliver.  In the twelfth line delete the words ""Replacement Price Differential, plus (ii) liquidated damages equal to $0.15"" and replace with the words ""Gas Daily Price"".  In line thirteen immediately after the word ""Quantity"" delete the words ""to cover Seller's administrative and operational costs"" so these 2 subsections now read as follows: (i) an amount equal to the product of Buyer's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the Gas Daily Price multiplied by

Although the Clark County gas deal is moving slower than I'd like it to, it is very much a live deal.  Thanks to all of you for your patients and assistance thus far.  Its being held up by the Master Agreement which their credit representative (Reid Grossmann) will be working on it AGAIN tomorrow. He will be in Houston and asked if he might meet with Debra and Jay in person.  He has assured me that our issues are being taken care of today. Since they still have some of their own issues, he is of the opinion that nothing can happen before Friday.  I intend to keep the heat on them and fully anticipate they will - at some point - transact. Thanks Again, Dave Fuller

Dear Debra: Our proposed restatement of Section 13.10 is as follows: ""Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the ""Repurchasers"") to whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable to receive gas from NEGM because such Repurchaser has been affected by an event of force majeure.  The parties further agree that the term ""Transporter"" when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in Sections 4.1. and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such

Gary, I have reviewed your GISB and Special Provisions my remarks are as follows: Concerning the first page,  Section 2.5 Enron prefers to be the confirming party; Section 3.2 we will agree to Spot Standard, and Section 13.5 Choice of Law we will agree to  New York or Texas. Special Provisions: 1. We would agree to this provision with minor changes in wording. 2. Agree to netting again with changes to language as follows: In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed. We do not agree with purposed revisions to the remaining sections. As previously stated,  ENA will  consider use of  the GISB for firm delivery for 30 days or less.   This of course does not apply to interruptible service.   If you intent is for greater that 30 days of firm delivery,  I suggest we explore use of our Master Agreement in combination with a GISB or alone.  The  Master  cannot be used for interruptible service  thus the need for the GISB. Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues and how you would like to proceed.

Gary, Thanks for your e-mail,  attached is a sample of our Master.  I notice we currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities? In response to your previous e-mail my comments  are as follows: We cannot agree to both parties confirming.  ENA prefers to be the confirming party. Section 13.5  NY law is fine. Our netting language is a stated below: In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed. Your suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract is not necessary as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first page in the disclaimer.  With regards to limitation, we do not limit transactions to one year. Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need to speak to someone in your office for credit information.

Debra, Hey, I'm hoping maybe you can help me out. I know this is a stretch, but I'm desperate.I'm working on a story for Image Magazine. It's about people from around the world who have moved to Brazoria County and their experiences here. I've done four stories from England to Australia, but cannot locate anyone from Latin America. Do you know if Enron would have someone from Central or South American and they now live in B.C.? Susan 
Kathy, Here is the final form w/ revisions.  Please review same and let me know if you see any problems.   I have had a few computer problems this afternoon so there is a chance this doc is not perfect.  Talk to you Monday.  Have a great weekend!!!!
