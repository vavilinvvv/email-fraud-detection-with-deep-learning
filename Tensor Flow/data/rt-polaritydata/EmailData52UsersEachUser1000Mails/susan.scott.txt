On July 27, 2001, the Commission approved the application of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power Company to transfer operational control of certain jurisdictional transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO when it becomes operational.  The approval was conditioned on Great River (MP's only network transmission customer) reaching agreement MP on how Great River's facilities will be operated by the ISO. With regard to the Midwest RTO, the Commission stated its approval of the transfer of operational control does not constitute a finding regarding the scope of an RTO for the Midwest. Please contact me if you need further information. Susan Scott Lindberg

On July 26, 2001, FERC issued an order conditionally approving the proposed tariff for the Neptune Project, which will consist of several thousand miles of undersea high-voltage direct current transmission systems connecting Main, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to the capacity-constrained markets of Maine, New York City, Long Island and Connecticut.  As a merchant transmission facility, Neptune proposed to assume all the risk of the the project.  It proposed rates effectively capped by market forces. Conditions on the Commission's approval: - Neptune must join an RTO adjacent to or containing the geographic area of its proposed faciliteis and must place operational control of its facilities under the RTO. - Service must be provided pursuant to the Order No 888 pro forma tariff (Commission denied Neptune's request for a waiver). - Neptune cannot negotiate bilateral transactions prior to conducting its open season; it must make all capacity available solely through the open season process. If you would like any further information, please let me know. Susan Scott Lindberg 
On July 25, 2001, FERC issued an order approving PJM's modification of the deadline for reserving daily, firm point-to-point transmission service from noon on the second day prior to commencement of service to noon on the day prior to the commencement of service, effective June 18, 2001. If you need further information, please let me know. Susan Scott Lindberg 
As some of you might already have heard, I will move to Enron Corp. Government Affairs on April 30.  My primary responsibility will be to advise the power traders on regulatory and other matters.  While it will be difficult to leave, I know this is a good opportunity for me.  Thank all of you for your encouragement, advice and support; this is a great group and I will miss working with you. 
Heard you were going to be back in the hot seat again today...how did it go? 
Jeff -- I assume you would have no objection to SoCal's proposed modification.  Let me know. And be sure to read to the very end for news about our pal bbbbri ian. 
Dear fellow signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement: On Friday of last week, SoCalGas and PG&E informed ALJ Biren that Altra had definitively declined to offer the electronic trading services that both the already-approved PG&E settlement and the pending SoCalGas/SDG&E Comprehensive Settlement contemplated would be provided specifically by Altra for at least an intial period.? Both SoCalGas and PG&E sent a letter and email to to the full service list yesterday (Tues, 9/5) informing parties of this development. SoCalGas believes that some modification to the Comprehensive Settlement in necessary to take this development into account, and that we then need to file the modification as soon as possible with the Commission.? The ALJ has indicated to us that some formal filing with the Commission in response to this development will be necessary. We want to work with the signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement to reach a consensus as soon as possible.? Our goal is to cause little or no delay in the processing of a decision on the Comprehensive Settlement. What SoCalGas has in mind is modifying the settlement to remove the specific naming of Altra and to insert language saying that SoCalGas will select and contract with a third-party provider for a specified period of time, without identifying in the settlement who that will be.?? We also need to consider whether we should address in the revision to the settlement how we will handle the possibility that the third-party provider will not be ready to operate by the April 1, 2001 date the settlement provides for the monthly imbalance trading, OFO day imbalance chip trading, and storage rights trading.? SoCalGas is looking at interim arrangements that it could provide in-house starting April 1, 2001, until the third-party provider could begin service.? We also might consider what would happen if no third party provider can be found. To avoid any claims that we have not complied with the settlement rules, today we mailed and emailed to the full service list a notice of a settlement conference for Wednesday of next week.? We want to file something with the Commission very promptly thereafter. Please feel free to contact Glen Sullivan at 619-699-5027, Lad Lorenz at 213-244-3820, Bob Betonte at 213-244-3832, or June Suwara at 213-244-3504 on this subject.? For those of you who have not heard, Brian Cherry has submitted his resignation from Sempra Energy's Regulatory Affairs Dept. and will be going to work shortly for PG&E in a similar capacity.

I just received a copy of a Section 5 complaint filed by SoCal requesting a FERC order 1) determining that the SoCalGas/Topock delivery point is fully subscribed on a firm primary basis, 2) directing El Paso to comply with previous Commission orders that preclude the selling of firm primary capacity at points where none is available and 3) directing El Paso to schedule capacity acquired during an open season (effective Jan. 1, 2000) into SoCal/Topock on a secondary basis only.  SoCal states that it has experienced daily cuts of up to 57% and averaging 25%.

As you'll see in the Legal bullets, TW Commercial has asked me to look into the following issue. As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from Needles by Dec. 2001. TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity.  Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their primary point to Needles. The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers, rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to sell out the expansion space. I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find.  If you have comments in the meantime, please let me know.  We may need to set up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks. 
Please see the attached and let me know your comments as soon as possible. <Embedded StdOleLink> 
Please see the attached and let me know your comments as soon as possible. 
For your comments. 
I could not remember where we were in the process of reviewing these posting & bidding procedures so I am sending them around one last time -- if anyone has any further comments please let me know. 
See the attached.  The notice assumes Calpine's bid is not binding. 
Jeff, here's a slightly revised version of my bottom-line answers to Conoco's questions. Am I remembering correctly that this is for internal distribution only? Again, I'll be out until around 10:30 tomorrow but you can reach me on my mobile (713.494.5002) before 9 or after 10 if there's anything you want to discuss.  Drew -- same goes for you. 
Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee. The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know. I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas or questions. As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss their questions?  Let me know what you think. Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting first, and when FERC staff is available to talk. 
Thought you'd be interested in the attached. 
Lorraine, Below are some very preliminary regulatory issues that I have identified regarding Transwestern's Transport Option Program.  These concerns may not constitute all of our concerns; I'm sure there will be more as we continue to review this proposal with our commercial people.  Also, they have not been reviewed with management, and may, or may not, represent the ultimate positions that Conoco (or the Indicated Shipper Trial Group) takes in any proceeding before the FERC. Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday.  Both Teddy and I found it to be very helpful and informative.  We look forward to a more detailed description of your proposal, and the ability to discuss it with Transwestern in a future customer meeting.  Please forward this e-mail on to Jeff; I don't have his direct e-mail address. Tentative Regulatory Issues regarding Transwestern's Transport Option Program (""TOP""). 1. Market Based Rates.  To the extent that TW intends to offer the TOP service without a corresponding cost based recourse service, under current FERC policy, TW would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of market power. 2. Comparable Service:  To the extent that TW implements a TOP service, it would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to offer a similar call & put capability in the capacity release market.  As I remember TW's tariffs, this would likely require specific changes to the capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases with a call or put pricing option. 3. Hoarding:  The TOP service should not be a means for any party (particularly an affiliate) to manipulate the transportation market and/or to exert market power by withholding capacity. 4. Reliability:  The TOP service should require sufficient protections to ensure continued, undiminished service to all of TW's existing and future FT customers. 5. Standardized Product:  The terms and conditions for the TOP service should be standardized in order that each TOP service offer is not considered a ""non-conforming"" contract under FERC policy.  The call and put options, and any administrative or operating limitations, should be specifically defined. 6. Non-preferential Service:  TW must ensure that the TOP service is offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable, and in a manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party (particularly an affiliate). 7. Revenue:  Regardless of whether the TOP is a cost or market based rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes. 8. Pilot Program.  Given the precedential nature of this proposal, perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the TOP if it were filed as an experimental program on TW, with a finite life.  This would allow parties to gain experience prior to having all of the Enron pipelines (and others) file for similar authority. Thanks again.

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant changes include: - added definition of Counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate - added an example of how options will work I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from the market. Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will have Janet call to determine your availability. 
As I have mentioned already a couple of times, the Commercial Group feels it is important to have something to present to customers.  My concern is that if we just tell them about it over lunch or over the phone, something is going to be ignored or lost in the translation, and then we'll have a dozen protests to contend with.  Surely we've presented new services to customers before in advance of filing...if so, how did we go about it? Also, are you OK with filing July 31, or just as soon as we can get a prefiling conference with FERC? 
I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure everything is addressed before filing. Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review beginning TODAY. 
Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week. Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14. The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows: Final draft comments   Friday, July 14 Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26 Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27 FERC filing    Monday, July 31 Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank you. 
Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what we have posted before. One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable Topock space is part of that package. Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.

FYI 
Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we always do). If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate. If you have any questions, let me know. 
Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several minor ""sentence structure"" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been included. Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596). The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter: 1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts. 2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper. Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area. The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis. 
Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to the agreement. I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date. Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in order to get the information you need. Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached before next Wednesday if possible. Thank you. 
Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present. 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale. 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year. 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option. 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether. 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance. 6.  Timeline: - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week) - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing) - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron) - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on) - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet) If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to get a new draft out by next Friday a.m. 
Drew, I thought you would be interested in this research memo from our law clerk. 
Susan, Per your request, I have attached a brief memo concerning capacity option exemptions and regulations.  If you have any questions or comments you would like to discuss before the 3 p.m. meeting please do not hesitate to contact me.  If the offer still stands, I would like to attend this afternoon's meeting. Brian Ext. 37629 
So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached. If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other. Thank you. 
Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement. Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues. I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

Spoke with PNM's counsel (Jay Golub) this morning.  He recognizes that PNM needs to get the relevant info to FERC in some form or fashion and would like us to tell him who at FERC is assigned to this proceeding so that he can talk with them, find out what exactly they need, etc.  He said they would probably be willing to send FERC something in writing if it might eliminate the need for a technical conference.  Donna--as I've indicated in my voice mail to you, just let me know who Jay needs to contact, and I'll call him back. Thanks.

Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably (i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Southwest Gas Corporation (SWG).  SWG shall enter into a 10 year agreement  for 14,000 Dth/d of seasonal (November through March) capacity effective November 1, 2000.  The transport rate of $.15/Dth/d shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d.  The primary path shall be from Tranwestern's  East of Thoreau (EOT) Area  to the SWG Interconnect located in the East of California Area. Alternate receipt point rights shall be from Tranwestern's EOT Area and from the Bloomfield Compressor.   SWG ROFR rights shall be wiaved. In additionTranswestern shall propose  to retain revenues generated by capacity release at rates higher than the effective contract's discount rate. (Please note that the FTS-1 Appendix A - not shown here with the discount letter-  specifically indicates 0 MMcf/d capacity for the April through October period.  Therefore, even though the $.1500/MMBtu rate in Paragraph 3 of the discount letter does not indicate the rate is a ""seasonal rate"", the effective billing to SWG shall be seasonal.) Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.   All Officer approvals shall be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval. 
Please take a look at this and let me know whether it accurately reflects what you discussed with ECS.  I'm reviewing it now and will let you know my comments soon.  They want to sign this up tomorrow. 
Susan, Attached is the supplement to the gas letter which increases the amount of gas TW delivers to the LLC. Please review and let me know. 
FYI 
The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not harmful to the compressor for the short term. It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any further feedback. TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit piping. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage. The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor. It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment or apply stress to the compressor nozzles. James Pfeffer 
Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m. if possible. 
Here it is.  Please let me know your comments today.  Thanks. 
SoCal's protest is ludicrous. I will work on a response. By the way, SoCal has actually been remarkably helpful in reaching agreement on a settlement -- which we just signed -- in the California GIR proceeding. 
FYI 
See the attached.  Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think. 
Today Christine Stokes will be circulating the discount letter for the USGT deal to the usual TW personnel for approval.  Since the revenue sharing mechanism agreed to by the parties creates a negotiated rate, we will need to make the appropriate filing before the April 1 effective date. Attached are 3 documents:  1) cover letter (nearly identical to NNG's), 2) tariff sheets and 3) a copy of the discount letter for your reference.  (Glen and Mary, please put my draft of the tariff sheets into the usual tariff sheet format.  I hope the columns line up on my draft  -- if it is confusing, let me know and I will fax you a copy.) Please let me know your comments as soon as possible...preferably by close of business Tuesday.  Thank you. 
Nothing in my research has indicated that a specific agreement is required in order to make this filing.  While it is true that one of the reasons FERC rejected the NNG filing in which we sought authority to hold capacity on unspecified pipelines was because it was too general, the Commission never stated that pipelines must file specific deals in order to comport with the Texas Eastern requirements.  I believe that the filing is specific enough to address the Commission's concerns because we have narrowed it down to a specific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a constraint on TW's system. The Commission did not require us to have an agreement with PG&E for Market Center services, and in fact we did not have a deal in place when we made our filing.   While I'm sure it's true that having a specific deal in place would make our filing even more convincing, the Commercial Group would like to maximize their flexibility to acquire capacity on PNM instead of having to ask permission for each deal they do with PNM, which is why we would prefer to use the same strategy we successfully employed in our Market Center services filing. On the Hinshaw issue -- I will forward you the relevant e-mail chain from last week. 
I received several comments from you, and I believe we've resolved the legal issue (PNM's Hinshaw status).  Any other comments? (Mary Kay, the answer to your question is that Lorraine has been discussing a rate with PNM, and the amount of capacity they have available is 10,000.)   Mary Kay and Mary, when do you think would be a reasonable time to expect to file this, given the Order 637 filings we're working on? I've attached my draft again in case you need it. Thanks. 
The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not guaranteeing a shipper ""daily"" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date. Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board. Thanks. 
The Commercial Group has been discussing with PNM the possibility of entering into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of PNM's system between Blanco and Rio Puerco.  This would effectively operate as an expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B. In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet all the Texas Eastern criteria. I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of ""Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. ___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period.""  In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.) 
Here's a draft of a letter asking for expeditious treatment of SWGas's application.  Let me know your comments by Wednesday afternoon if possible. Thanks. 
As you know, we are still waiting for FERC to issue the necessary certificate authority for the Southwest Gas/TW interconnect.  Ideally, the interconnect facilities would be approved so that they could be constructed by the Gallup in-service date.  Two of our Gallup shippers, Sempra and Reliant, have provisions in their Gallup contracts giving them the option to change their primary delivery point to the proposed Southwest Gas interconnect.  The TW commercial group approached me about a motion to expedite based on this contractual right.  (Keith, I know we've spoken about this before with Lorraine).  Lorraine called her business contact at Reliant, and Reliant's regulatory counsel in D.C. called me today to get more information.  He sounded very positive about filing a motion to expedite a decision in this proceeding and I sent him the relevant background information to get him started.  Getting Sempra to consider filing a similar motion might be more difficult, but Jeff Fawcett is going to work on his business contact there. I am going to put together and circulate a motion or letter to FERC from TW, stating that TW's ability to provide service to its shippers will be affected unless certificate authority is granted soon.  Any comments in the meantime -- let me know. 
Couldn't stand the suspense, could you.  In case Janet was not able to send you what you needed, here they  are: (final) (still need to look at) 
Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested by the Commission. I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I do not expect the agreement to change significantly. 
My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here: ** In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made public. FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events. FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996). ** In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not: the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements. There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases. Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if I find anything.

PG&E wants to buy backhaul service! 
Drew, what is BNSF? 
The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the ""deal"" --- or at least the conversations of the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments? 
TRANSWESTERN CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached discount letter for New Mexico Natural Gas, Inc. (NMNG).

The contract's MAXDQ varies by month and is show on the  Appendix A of the discount letter. Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY. Officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval. ] 
Keith, I believe our strategy is that unless FERC acts negatively on our motion (i.e., orders us to comply), we are just not going to file anything. MKM and DF, please let me know if I am out of line here. I will work on our request for rehearing and try to get a draft to everyone by Thursday (want Fawcett's input on competitive harm and he will not be back in the office until Wed.).  It's not due until 30 days out, but why not get it ready to go early. Keith Petersen 01/24/2000 09:28 AM 
Susan, have we been granted the extension for filing the discounts?  I did not see anything on RIMS this morning.  If not, does Donna need to have something ready for Friday the 28th?  That would be our 15 days.  Please let me know. Keith 
Drew, here is a draft of a letter responding to USGT's with regard to the unpaid invoice for alternate points.  Thought I would see if you have any comments before I pass it along to Mr. Fawcett.  With regard to my reference to our Errors in Billing tariff provision, I was torn between backing up my statement vs. pointing them to potentially troublesome language (ie ""mutual mistake""), but figured they would ask for the tariff provision so I included it.  Also, Elsa really attacks us for not billing them previously so I thought I should address that.   Let me know what you think. 
Christine, you need a comma between July and August.  Otherwise this looks fine. Christine Stokes 01/17/2000 08:50 AM 
TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Phillips Petroleum Company.  Phillips has agree to extend their 30,000 Dth/d Ignacio to El Paso/Blanco contract for five years beginning 2/1/2001.  The one-part seasonal rate structure of $.04 (April-Oct) and $.035 (Nov-March) will escalate by $.005  each of the last two years.  Phillips may use a south to north alternate flow path for an incremental $.01 based on actual utilization. Please  approve via REPLY WITH HISTORY. All officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential approval 
Attached is my first try at our motion to extend time.  Your written comments would be appreciated. 
I'm confused -- are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the Commission's conditions, or an extension of time to file a motion for rehearing? 
Drew -- HH did leave me the new lawyer's name and # so let's discuss whether we should phone him once Howard is safely on the plane to Costa Rica.  In the meantime, Lorraine already asked Meaders for the cases Howard cited, but he said he'd have to consult with his lawyers in order to do that, so I'm sure the answer will be ""no.""  Snooping around at FERC is starting to sound like a good idea, but I'm in uncharted territory here so won't do any of that before discussing it with you. 
I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad. Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder Morgan lawyers.

Marathon and Phillips Join Protest Two more shippers have joined Amoco and Burlington Resources in their joint protest against El Paso?s decision to sell to Enron 1.2 Bcf of excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. Marathon and Phillips have joined in the protest, attacking the entire deal as anti-competitive. The protesters hope FERC will force El Paso to begin again with capacity assignments. Amoco and Burlington had already protested the deal two weeks ago at FERC, when they claimed the sale would violate El Paso?s rate case settlement and tariff. The shippers argue that El Paso was trying to sell part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than PG&E/Topock), which the settlement prohibits. The settlement was intended to protect PG&E and allow it to access service. If this capacity is delivered at other points such as SoCal/Topock, it could add to the glut at that point, the protesters argued. El Paso and Enron stand to gain if the basis differential between the San Juan Basin and California remains large. Marathon and Phillips say that Enron and El Paso can manipulate that basis differential because between them and their affiliates they control all the excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. ______________________________________________________________________ Energy Seminars New 2000 Dates!

Speculator long positions now outnumber short positions by 1.4 to 1 compared with a ratio of 2.9 to 1 two weeks earlier and 3.8 to 1 four weeks earlier. Prices peaked at a post-Gulf-War high of $27.15 a barrel November 22nd and ended the year at $25.60. Long positions in crude oil futures on the NYMEX held by hedge funds and large speculators were 44,233 on December 28th, little changed from 44,693 on December 14th, according to the CFTC. Speculator short positions doubled, though, to 31,868 from 15,364. Speculators also became less bullish about both gasoline and heating oil as their short positions increased much more than the long positions did during the two-week period. The ratio of longs to shorts in gasoline fell to about 3-to-2 from 20-to-1. For natural gas, speculators increased their overall bet that gas prices would fall. They had placed bets for rising gas prices from April until mid-November, when a lack of severe cold weather demand pulled prices down from a two-year high. The following table shows the changes in speculator positions for crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and natural gas futures.

The transaction is expected to close in February. The sale includes natural gas reserves totaling approximately 1.1 Tcf, 6,500 production wells, and 4,000 miles of pipeline network in Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Sale of the exploration and production business is the first step in The Statoil Group?s overall plan of complete divestment of Statoil Energy. Statoil Energy?s remaining businesses, power generation, energy marketing and trading,  will be offered for sale in a separate process starting later this month. The divestment plan is part of Statoil?s overall restructuring program to concentrate on its core business activities: exploration and production in Norway and other selected areas of the world; the European natural gas and energy business; crude oil trading, refining and marketing; and petrochemicals.

EPRIsolutions is a for-profit subsidiary created to hasten the application of EPRI technologies already developed through decades of collaborative research. EPRIsolutions will work directly with our customers to select, install and support the EPRI technologies most suitable for their particular needs. Many of the services offered will be performed by the staff of EPRI?s Technology Application Centers located throughout the US. For example, the Engineering and Test Centers in Lenox, Mass. and Haslet, Tex. can provide audits of utility power delivery systems to identify weaknesses before they lead to outages. The Maintenance and Diagnostics Center in Charlotte, N.C. can help customers save on the cost of operating and maintaining their fossil-fired power plants. As an example of how such integrated services will be offered, EPRIsolutions can help customers adapt and install the powerful, sophisticated software packages now available for load forecasting, environmental risk assessment, and retail market management. In some cases, EPRIsolutions will go one step further by acting as an application service provider for companies that want to outsource data-intensive operations. The first such ASP activity will be on-line monitoring and diagnosis of water chemistry for several nuclear power plants. EPRIsolutions is being formed through the merger of two existing subsidiaries, EPRICSG and EPRIGEN, which were created to allow EPRI to conduct proprietary R&D on behalf of individual funders, who would retain rights to the intellectual property involved. In addition to continuing this activity, EPRIsolutions takes on the function of providing customized technology application and consulting services. Such private-benefit work lies beyond the scope of EPRI's tax-exempt, collaborative research mission and thus requires the use of a taxable subsidiary. ______________________________________________________________________ HEAD?S UP? PRICES DOWN! Natural gas prices have fallen to $2.40/MMBtu from $3.20/MMBtu just last month. Storage injections still outweigh storage withdrawals. Where will prices go? Depends on the weather. If it is warm in Houston and New York City over the Thanksgiving holidays, will prices continue to head south? Under those conditions, they have since 1993. Call it ?Rader?s Stupid Frozen Turkey Theory? or call it storage fundamentals, but be prepared in case this silly theory comes true one more year.

Oxy received fields in California that produce about 12 MMcf per day and mineral rights to more than 700,000 acres of land in the state. It also received properties in the western Gulf that produce 26 MMcfe per day, adjacent to fields Oxy already owns. EOG received properties in eastern Texas that are next to fields it owns and which produce 33 MMcf per day and 3,000 barrels of oil a day. It also acquired exploration rights on 312,000 acres in the Oklahoma panhandle. _____________________________________________________________________ Houston Energy Expo              GasMart/Power2000 Are you planning to attend the Houston Energy Expo or GasMart/Power2000?

Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail anyway! Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything interesting happens I'll let you know. 
As you'll see in the Legal bullets, TW Commercial has asked me to look into the following issue. As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from Needles by Dec. 2001. TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity. Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their primary point to Needles. The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers, rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to sell out the expansion space. I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find. If you have comments in the meantime, please let me know.  We may need to set up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks.

My experience with the February deals this week has shown me that we need to improve our system of communication on negotiated rate deals. I think a simple checklist for the marketers, legal & reg. would help. Here's what I suggest: - Marketer:  Work with Susan on negotiated rate contract language.  E-mail draft of contract to Glen, Mary, Susan, Mary Kay and Drew for information and for sign-off by Legal and Regulatory prior to sending to the shipper. - Mary and Susan -- have a telephone conversation to confirm that a filing needs to be made, and if so when.  If a filing does not need to be made immediately, note filing date on both Mary's and Susan's calendars (and on Filing Log). - Marketer:  Contract must be executed at least one day before gas flow. Once contract is executed, immediately (1) fax it to Mary at 402-398-7006 and (2) make sure the contract representative (Linda Trevino?) knows that it is a negotiated rate deal and needs to be posted on the transactional report. - Mary?  Susan?:  Contact Linda Trevino to let her know the negotiated rate tariff page that should be reference on the transactional report. -  Mary/Glen:  Draft negotiated rate filing and have Susan or Maria review. Rate language in tariff should be identical to contract negotiated rate language.  Send to D.C. for filing. Let me know if I've left anything out, and I'll get this edited, spiffed up, etc. and circulate it to the marketers so we can get through April and all other future deals without a hitch. 
Mary Kay, here is my proposed ""fix"" for paragraph 1 b.  ...running it by yo= u=20 just to make sure I understood your message correctly.  Let me know if this= =20 is OK.

However, it was not Transwestern=01,s intent t= o so=20 limit the availability of recourse service.

Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes to the attached.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have questions.

Lillian, I forgot to add that the slate of directors and officers for Capacity Management Corp. will be identical to that of Transwestern Pipeline 
Steve Stojic called to let me know that the technical conference in RP01-56 
PG&E wants to buy backhaul service! 
Just so you can see how this is evolving... I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because it sounds like we are buying/selling gas. I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only information she still needs from us, I think. I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today. 
Here some other ideas: TransCap, Inc. TransGas, Inc. or maybe(!), FullPipe'R'Us Corp. Susan Scott 12/08/2000 02:28 PM 
OK, here's my 2 cents' worth: Avale Corp. I also like Enable. I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers... Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive. Jeffery Fawcett 12/08/2000 02:04 PM

My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here: ** In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made public. FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events. FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996). ** In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not: the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements. There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases. Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if I find anything.

Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested by the Commission. I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I do not expect the agreement to change significantly. 
Couldn't stand the suspense, could you.  In case Janet was not able to send you what you needed, here they  are: (final) (still need to look at) 
As you know, we are still waiting for FERC to issue the necessary certificate authority for the Southwest Gas/TW interconnect.  Ideally, the interconnect facilities would be approved so that they could be constructed by the Gallup in-service date.  Two of our Gallup shippers, Sempra and Reliant, have provisions in their Gallup contracts giving them the option to change their primary delivery point to the proposed Southwest Gas interconnect.  The TW commercial group approached me about a motion to expedite based on this contractual right.  (Keith, I know we've spoken about this before with Lorraine).  Lorraine called her business contact at Reliant, and Reliant's regulatory counsel in D.C. called me today to get more information.  He sounded very positive about filing a motion to expedite a decision in this proceeding and I sent him the relevant background information to get him started.  Getting Sempra to consider filing a similar motion might be more difficult, but Jeff Fawcett is going to work on his business contact there. I am going to put together and circulate a motion or letter to FERC from TW, stating that TW's ability to provide service to its shippers will be affected unless certificate authority is granted soon.  Any comments in the meantime -- let me know. 
Here's a draft of a letter asking for expeditious treatment of SWGas's application.  Let me know your comments by Wednesday afternoon if possible. Thanks.

The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period.""  In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.) 
As you'll see in the Legal bullets, TW Commercial has asked me to look into the following issue. As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from Needles by Dec. 2001.

The Commercial Group has been discussing with PNM the possibility of entering into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of PNM's system between Blanco and Rio Puerco.  This would effectively operate as an expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B. In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet all the Texas Eastern criteria. I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of ""Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. ___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not guaranteeing a shipper ""daily"" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date. Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board. Thanks. 
Nothing in my research has indicated that a specific agreement is required in order to make this filing.  While it is true that one of the reasons FERC rejected the NNG filing in which we sought authority to hold capacity on unspecified pipelines was because it was too general, the Commission never stated that pipelines must file specific deals in order to comport with the Texas Eastern requirements.  I believe that the filing is specific enough to address the Commission's concerns because we have narrowed it down to a specific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a constraint on TW's system. The Commission did not require us to have an agreement with PG&E for Market Center services, and in fact we did not have a deal in place when we made our filing.   While I'm sure it's true that having a specific deal in place would make our filing even more convincing, the Commercial Group would like to maximize their flexibility to acquire capacity on PNM instead of having to ask permission for each deal they do with PNM, which is why we would prefer to use the same strategy we successfully employed in our Market Center services filing. On the Hinshaw issue -- I will forward you the relevant e-mail chain from last week. 
I received several comments from you, and I believe we've resolved the legal issue (PNM's Hinshaw status).  Any other comments? (Mary Kay, the answer to your question is that Lorraine has been discussing a rate with PNM, and the amount of capacity they have available is 10,000.)   Mary Kay and Mary, when do you think would be a reasonable time to expect to file this, given the Order 637 filings we're working on? I've attached my draft again in case you need it. Thanks. 
Today Christine Stokes will be circulating the discount letter for the USGT deal to the usual TW personnel for approval.  Since the revenue sharing mechanism agreed to by the parties creates a negotiated rate, we will need to make the appropriate filing before the April 1 effective date. Attached are 3 documents:  1) cover letter (nearly identical to NNG's), 2) tariff sheets and 3) a copy of the discount letter for your reference.  (Glen and Mary, please put my draft of the tariff sheets into the usual tariff sheet format.  I hope the columns line up on my draft  -- if it is confusing, let me know and I will fax you a copy.) Please let me know your comments as soon as possible...preferably by close of business Tuesday.  Thank you. 
FYI 
See the attached.  Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think. 
SoCal's protest is ludicrous. I will work on a response. By the way, SoCal has actually been remarkably helpful in reaching agreement on a settlement -- which we just signed -- in the California GIR proceeding. 
Here it is.  Please let me know your comments today.  Thanks. 
Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m. if possible. 
FYI 
The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not harmful to the compressor for the short term. It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any further feedback. TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit piping. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage. The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor. It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment or apply stress to the compressor nozzles. James Pfeffer

Marathon and Phillips Join Protest Two more shippers have joined Amoco and Burlington Resources in their joint protest against El Paso?s decision to sell to Enron 1.2 Bcf of excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. Marathon and Phillips have joined in the protest, attacking the entire deal as anti-competitive. The protesters hope FERC will force El Paso to begin again with capacity assignments. Amoco and Burlington had already protested the deal two weeks ago at FERC, when they claimed the sale would violate El Paso?s rate case settlement and tariff. The shippers argue that El Paso was trying to sell part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than PG&E/Topock), which the settlement prohibits. The settlement was intended to protect PG&E and allow it to access service. If this capacity is delivered at other points such as SoCal/Topock, it could add to the glut at that point, the protesters argued. El Paso and Enron stand to gain if the basis differential between the San Juan Basin and California remains large. Marathon and Phillips say that Enron and El Paso can manipulate that basis differential because between them and their affiliates they control all the excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. ______________________________________________________________________ Energy Seminars New 2000 Dates!

Speculator long positions now outnumber short positions by 1.4 to 1 compared with a ratio of 2.9 to 1 two weeks earlier and 3.8 to 1 four weeks earlier. Prices peaked at a post-Gulf-War high of $27.15 a barrel November 22nd and ended the year at $25.60. Long positions in crude oil futures on the NYMEX held by hedge funds and large speculators were 44,233 on December 28th, little changed from 44,693 on December 14th, according to the CFTC. Speculator short positions doubled, though, to 31,868 from 15,364. Speculators also became less bullish about both gasoline and heating oil as their short positions increased much more than the long positions did during the two-week period. The ratio of longs to shorts in gasoline fell to about 3-to-2 from 20-to-1. For natural gas, speculators increased their overall bet that gas prices would fall.

The transaction is expected to close in February. The sale includes natural gas reserves totaling approximately 1.1 Tcf, 6,500 production wells, and 4,000 miles of pipeline network in Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Sale of the exploration and production business is the first step in The Statoil Group?s overall plan of complete divestment of Statoil Energy. Statoil Energy?s remaining businesses, power generation, energy marketing and trading,  will be offered for sale in a separate process starting later this month. The divestment plan is part of Statoil?s overall restructuring program to concentrate on its core business activities: exploration and production in Norway and other selected areas of the world; the European natural gas and energy business; crude oil trading, refining and marketing; and petrochemicals.

EPRIsolutions is a for-profit subsidiary created to hasten the application of EPRI technologies already developed through decades of collaborative research. EPRIsolutions will work directly with our customers to select, install and support the EPRI technologies most suitable for their particular needs. Many of the services offered will be performed by the staff of EPRI?s Technology Application Centers located throughout the US. For example, the Engineering and Test Centers in Lenox, Mass. and Haslet, Tex. can provide audits of utility power delivery systems to identify weaknesses before they lead to outages. The Maintenance and Diagnostics Center in Charlotte, N.C. can help customers save on the cost of operating and maintaining their fossil-fired power plants. As an example of how such integrated services will be offered, EPRIsolutions can help customers adapt and install the powerful, sophisticated software packages now available for load forecasting, environmental risk assessment, and retail market management. In some cases, EPRIsolutions will go one step further by acting as an application service provider for companies that want to outsource data-intensive operations. The first such ASP activity will be on-line monitoring and diagnosis of water chemistry for several nuclear power plants. EPRIsolutions is being formed through the merger of two existing subsidiaries, EPRICSG and EPRIGEN, which were created to allow EPRI to conduct proprietary R&D on behalf of individual funders, who would retain rights to the intellectual property involved. In addition to continuing this activity, EPRIsolutions takes on the function of providing customized technology application and consulting services. Such private-benefit work lies beyond the scope of EPRI's tax-exempt, collaborative research mission and thus requires the use of a taxable subsidiary. ______________________________________________________________________ HEAD?S UP? PRICES DOWN! Natural gas prices have fallen to $2.40/MMBtu from $3.20/MMBtu just last month. Storage injections still outweigh storage withdrawals. Where will prices go? Depends on the weather. If it is warm in Houston and New York City over the Thanksgiving holidays, will prices continue to head south? Under those conditions, they have since 1993.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Southwest Gas Corporation (SWG).  SWG shall enter into a 10 year agreement  for 14,000 Dth/d of seasonal (November through March) capacity effective November 1, 2000.  The transport rate of $.15/Dth/d shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d.  The primary path shall be from Tranwestern's  East of Thoreau (EOT) Area  to the SWG Interconnect located in the East of California Area. Alternate receipt point rights shall be from Tranwestern's EOT Area and from the Bloomfield Compressor.   SWG ROFR rights shall be wiaved. In additionTranswestern shall propose  to retain revenues generated by capacity release at rates higher than the effective contract's discount rate. (Please note that the FTS-1 Appendix A - not shown here with the discount letter-  specifically indicates 0 MMcf/d capacity for the April through October period.  Therefore, even though the $.1500/MMBtu rate in Paragraph 3 of the discount letter does not indicate the rate is a ""seasonal rate"", the effective billing to SWG shall be seasonal.) Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.   All Officer approvals shall be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval. 
Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably (i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too.  Comments?  let me know. 
FYI 
(See attached file: rp00-249.now.set.doc) This is what I plan to file today. - rp00-249.now.set.doc 
Spoke with PNM's counsel (Jay Golub) this morning.  He recognizes that PNM needs to get the relevant info to FERC in some form or fashion and would like us to tell him who at FERC is assigned to this proceeding so that he can talk with them, find out what exactly they need, etc.  He said they would probably be willing to send FERC something in writing if it might eliminate the need for a technical conference.  Donna--as I've indicated in my voice mail to you, just let me know who Jay needs to contact, and I'll call him back. Thanks.

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement. Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues. I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks. 
So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached. If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other. Thank you.

Drew, I thought you would be interested in this research memo from our law clerk. 
Susan, Per your request, I have attached a brief memo concerning capacity option exemptions and regulations.  If you have any questions or comments you would like to discuss before the 3 p.m. meeting please do not hesitate to contact me.  If the offer still stands, I would like to attend this afternoon's meeting. Brian Ext. 37629 
Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present. 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale. 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year. 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option. 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether. 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance. 6.  Timeline: - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week) - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing) - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron) - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on) - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet) If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to get a new draft out by next Friday a.m. 
Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to the agreement. I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date. Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in order to get the information you need. Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached before next Wednesday if possible. Thank you. 
Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several minor ""sentence structure"" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been included. Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596). The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter: 1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts. 2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper. Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area. The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis. 
FYI 
Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we always do). If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate. If you have any questions, let me know. 
Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week. Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14. The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows: Final draft comments   Friday, July 14 Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26 Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27 FERC filing    Monday, July 31 Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank you. 
Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what we have posted before. One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable Topock space is part of that package. Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call. 
As I have mentioned already a couple of times, the Commercial Group feels it is important to have something to present to customers.  My concern is that if we just tell them about it over lunch or over the phone, something is going to be ignored or lost in the translation, and then we'll have a dozen protests to contend with.  Surely we've presented new services to customers before in advance of filing...if so, how did we go about it? Also, are you OK with filing July 31, or just as soon as we can get a prefiling conference with FERC? 
I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure everything is addressed before filing. Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review beginning TODAY.

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant changes include: - added definition of Counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate - added an example of how options will work I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from the market. Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will have Janet call to determine your availability. 
Thought you'd be interested in the attached. 
Lorraine, Below are some very preliminary regulatory issues that I have identified regarding Transwestern's Transport Option Program.  These concerns may not constitute all of our concerns; I'm sure there will be more as we continue to review this proposal with our commercial people.  Also, they have not been reviewed with management, and may, or may not, represent the ultimate positions that Conoco (or the Indicated Shipper Trial Group) takes in any proceeding before the FERC. Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday.  Both Teddy and I found it to be very helpful and informative.  We look forward to a more detailed description of your proposal, and the ability to discuss it with Transwestern in a future customer meeting.  Please forward this e-mail on to Jeff; I don't have his direct e-mail address. Tentative Regulatory Issues regarding Transwestern's Transport Option Program (""TOP""). 1. Market Based Rates.  To the extent that TW intends to offer the TOP service without a corresponding cost based recourse service, under current FERC policy, TW would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of market power. 2. Comparable Service:  To the extent that TW implements a TOP service, it would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to offer a similar call & put capability in the capacity release market.  As I remember TW's tariffs, this would likely require specific changes to the capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases with a call or put pricing option. 3. Hoarding:  The TOP service should not be a means for any party (particularly an affiliate) to manipulate the transportation market and/or to exert market power by withholding capacity. 4. Reliability:  The TOP service should require sufficient protections to ensure continued, undiminished service to all of TW's existing and future FT customers. 5. Standardized Product:  The terms and conditions for the TOP service should be standardized in order that each TOP service offer is not considered a ""non-conforming"" contract under FERC policy.  The call and put options, and any administrative or operating limitations, should be specifically defined. 6. Non-preferential Service:  TW must ensure that the TOP service is offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable, and in a manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party (particularly an affiliate). 7. Revenue:  Regardless of whether the TOP is a cost or market based rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes. 8. Pilot Program.  Given the precedential nature of this proposal, perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the TOP if it were filed as an experimental program on TW, with a finite life.  This would allow parties to gain experience prior to having all of the Enron pipelines (and others) file for similar authority. Thanks again.

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee. The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know. I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas or questions. As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss their questions?  Let me know what you think. Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting first, and when FERC staff is available to talk. 
I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad. Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder Morgan lawyers. 
Jeff, here's a slightly revised version of my bottom-line answers to Conoco's questions. Am I remembering correctly that this is for internal distribution only? Again, I'll be out until around 10:30 tomorrow but you can reach me on my mobile (713.494.5002) before 9 or after 10 if there's anything you want to discuss.  Drew -- same goes for you. 
Drew -- HH did leave me the new lawyer's name and # so let's discuss whether we should phone him once Howard is safely on the plane to Costa Rica.  In the meantime, Lorraine already asked Meaders for the cases Howard cited, but he said he'd have to consult with his lawyers in order to do that, so I'm sure the answer will be ""no.""  Snooping around at FERC is starting to sound like a good idea, but I'm in uncharted territory here so won't do any of that before discussing it with you.

I'm confused -- are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the Commission's conditions, or an extension of time to file a motion for rehearing? 
Attached is my first try at our motion to extend time.  Your written comments would be appreciated. 
Christine, you need a comma between July and August.  Otherwise this looks fine. Christine Stokes 01/17/2000 08:50 AM 
TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Phillips Petroleum Company.  Phillips has agree to extend their 30,000 Dth/d Ignacio to El Paso/Blanco contract for five years beginning 2/1/2001.  The one-part seasonal rate structure of $.04 (April-Oct) and $.035 (Nov-March) will escalate by $.005  each of the last two years.  Phillips may use a south to north alternate flow path for an incremental $.01 based on actual utilization. Please  approve via REPLY WITH HISTORY. All officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential approval 
Drew, here is a draft of a letter responding to USGT's with regard to the unpaid invoice for alternate points.  Thought I would see if you have any comments before I pass it along to Mr. Fawcett.  With regard to my reference to our Errors in Billing tariff provision, I was torn between backing up my statement vs. pointing them to potentially troublesome language (ie ""mutual mistake""), but figured they would ask for the tariff provision so I included it.  Also, Elsa really attacks us for not billing them previously so I thought I should address that.   Let me know what you think. 
Here is what I think is a final draft...I'm going to give it one last read thru...if you have further comments let me know immediately.  Thanks. 
done. 
Keith, I believe our strategy is that unless FERC acts negatively on our motion (i.e., orders us to comply), we are just not going to file anything. MKM and DF, please let me know if I am out of line here. I will work on our request for rehearing and try to get a draft to everyone by Thursday (want Fawcett's input on competitive harm and he will not be back in the office until Wed.).  It's not due until 30 days out, but why not get it ready to go early. Keith Petersen 01/24/2000 09:28 AM 
Susan, have we been granted the extension for filing the discounts?  I did not see anything on RIMS this morning.  If not, does Donna need to have something ready for Friday the 28th?  That would be our 15 days.  Please let me know. Keith 
Here is a very rough draft -- an outline, really -- of an answer to Indicated Shippers' protest. Please provide comments as you see fit.  I will probably not have time to look at them until later in the afternoon tomorrow, at which time I will also do a lot more writing (i.e., making complete sentences, transitions, heading, conclusion, etc.).  In other words, of greatest interest to me right now are your ideas on the best way to rebut the Shippers' arguments (including identifying those that might be safe to ignore). Thank you! 
Currently I have 2 machines (one on 41, one on 47) plus a laptop. Jean McFarland contacted me a couple of months ago with this idea.  Basically we would be replacing 3 computers with one laptop.  I will probably want to get a regular sized monitor for my work station on 41 (I do not know if this is included in the ""docking station"" entry). If you like, I can get Jean to do the math on how much we would be saving, if anything.  My machine on 47 is really out of date.  Someone else can use my brand new computer on 41 though. 
The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the ""deal"" --- or at least the conversations of the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments? 
TRANSWESTERN CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached discount letter for New Mexico Natural Gas, Inc. (NMNG).   The contract's five year term provides for EOT-EOT receipts and deliveries at a $.05/Dth/day transportation rate.  The contract's MAXDQ varies by month and is show on the  Appendix A of the discount letter. Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY. Officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval. ] 
First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that used to be IT. It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint. Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff. I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute. Drew Fossum 11/19/2000 06:32 PM 
Susan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat about the deals, so please give me a call Mon. AM and let me know what you know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an LFT deal.  DF Mary Kay Miller 11/19/2000 07:39 AM 
We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK Mary Darveaux 11/16/2000 05:34 PM 
I forgot to add that this is an LFT.

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because they are ""unconscionable.""  There are several examples in consumer law and employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains struck at arms length. Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some looking, please let me know if you've found anything. 
I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference. The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in protests. I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail me if you have questions. 
Drew -- I worked with Jeff on this draft so it already contains my comments. 
As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some reading and here are my thoughts. The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act. Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that ""any rate, charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or classification"" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but ""fixed"" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable... In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable.  ""Just and reasonable"" has been interpreted in many different contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means. As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably. However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a more in-depth report. 
For your information.  The outcome was great for TW because the Cal. PUC adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.  The outcome is not so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement. The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of the competing settlements. I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have questions. S. 
Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me... The problem: As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate,"" and the additional frustrating language ""[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ..""  At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above. However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language. Why the problem exists (you may already know): Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates.  ""[T]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
Do you know of any reason we can't do this?  I'm doing research right now but am not finding anything on point. 
Rich, Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to operate their Griffith system.  We can ""hedge"" our proposal based on the need to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be. 
I believe Leslie does regulatory/legal work for ENA on a contract basis. Steven Harris 11/29/2000 08:58 AM 
I am not sure about Leslie Lawner but maybe Drew or Susan Scott know. I do not get reports from anyone else regarding activities in any state. Mike McGowan 11/29/2000 08:33 AM 
Steve - is Leslie Launer(sp?) an Enron employee?   I know she once was, but I believe she lives in New Mexico and is used by Enron at times.  Do we use her?  What is her status and relationship with the pipeline group?? Do you get any reports from Tom Rutherford on New Mexico?? 
Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20 going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff= =20 filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that= =20 recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or= =20 2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow= ed=20 to charge market based rates. The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la= ck=20 of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20 prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20 market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in= =20 TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the= =20 price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20 possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our= =20 system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper= s=20 to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff. Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I= n=20 the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates. *** To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20 request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20 showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds= =20 all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma= ke=20 the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect. =20 Application for declaratory order must include: 1.

The Commission requires a narrow definition of the= =20 market=01(""firm transportation"" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp= oses=20 we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20 Thoreau).  We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o= ther=20 pipelines are a ""good substitute"" only if shippers can obtain the same=20 quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such= =20 service at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20 10%.

Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good= =20 alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20 quantity. 3.

Drew, what is BNSF? 
Can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues I raised last week? If you can do it tomorrow, let me know what times you are not available and 
We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing. The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What exactly do we mean by ""no additional cost...unless through the allocation process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel""??   Can someone help me with this? Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright. However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language.  Or they could tell us to remove the ""subject to transportation and fuel"" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer. However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC. Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated. 
Sounds like 2:00 will work for everyone; Drew, we will call you from Steve's 
The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period.""  In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.) 
The Commercial Group has been discussing with PNM the possibility of entering into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of PNM's system between Blanco and Rio Puerco.  This would effectively operate as an expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B. In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet all the Texas Eastern criteria. I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of ""Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. ___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
See the attached.  The notice assumes Calpine's bid is not binding. 
Today Christine Stokes will be circulating the discount letter for the USGT deal to the usual TW personnel for approval.  Since the revenue sharing mechanism agreed to by the parties creates a negotiated rate, we will need to make the appropriate filing before the April 1 effective date. Attached are 3 documents:  1) cover letter (nearly identical to NNG's), 2) tariff sheets and 3) a copy of the discount letter for your reference.  (Glen and Mary, please put my draft of the tariff sheets into the usual tariff sheet format.  I hope the columns line up on my draft  -- if it is confusing, let me know and I will fax you a copy.) Please let me know your comments as soon as possible...preferably by close of business Tuesday.  Thank you. 
FYI 
The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not harmful to the compressor for the short term. It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any further feedback. TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit piping. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage. The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor. It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment or apply stress to the compressor nozzles. James Pfeffer 
Please take a look at this and let me know whether it accurately reflects what you discussed with ECS.  I'm reviewing it now and will let you know my comments soon.  They want to sign this up tomorrow. 
Susan, Attached is the supplement to the gas letter which increases the amount of gas TW delivers to the LLC. Please review and let me know. 
Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail anyway! Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything interesting happens I'll let you know. 
Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement. Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues. I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks. 
Drew, I thought you would be interested in this research memo from our law clerk. 
Susan, Per your request, I have attached a brief memo concerning capacity option exemptions and regulations.  If you have any questions or comments you would like to discuss before the 3 p.m. meeting please do not hesitate to contact me.  If the offer still stands, I would like to attend this afternoon's meeting. Brian Ext. 37629 
Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present. 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale. 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year. 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option. 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether. 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance. 6.  Timeline: - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week) - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing) - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron) - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on) - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet) If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to get a new draft out by next Friday a.m. 
Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to the agreement. I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date. Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in order to get the information you need. Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached before next Wednesday if possible. Thank you. 
Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several minor ""sentence structure"" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been included. Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596). The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter: 1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts. 2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper. Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area. The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis. 
Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week. Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14. The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows: Final draft comments   Friday, July 14 Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26 Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27 FERC filing    Monday, July 31 Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank you. 
Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant changes include: - added definition of Counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate - added an example of how options will work I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from the market. Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will have Janet call to determine your availability. 
Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee. The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know. I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas or questions. As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss their questions?  Let me know what you think. Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting first, and when FERC staff is available to talk. 
I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad. Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder Morgan lawyers. 
Attached is my first try at our motion to extend time.  Your written comments would be appreciated.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Phillips Petroleum Company.  Phillips has agree to extend their 30,000 Dth/d Ignacio to El Paso/Blanco contract for five years beginning 2/1/2001.  The one-part seasonal rate structure of $.04 (April-Oct) and $.035 (Nov-March) will escalate by $.005  each of the last two years.  Phillips may use a south to north alternate flow path for an incremental $.01 based on actual utilization. Please  approve via REPLY WITH HISTORY. All officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential approval 
Here is what I think is a final draft...I'm going to give it one last read thru...if you have further comments let me know immediately.  Thanks. 
done. 
Here is a very rough draft -- an outline, really -- of an answer to Indicated Shippers' protest. Please provide comments as you see fit.  I will probably not have time to look at them until later in the afternoon tomorrow, at which time I will also do a lot more writing (i.e., making complete sentences, transitions, heading, conclusion, etc.).  In other words, of greatest interest to me right now are your ideas on the best way to rebut the Shippers' arguments (including identifying those that might be safe to ignore). Thank you! 
Currently I have 2 machines (one on 41, one on 47) plus a laptop. Jean McFarland contacted me a couple of months ago with this idea.  Basically we would be replacing 3 computers with one laptop.  I will probably want to get a regular sized monitor for my work station on 41 (I do not know if this is included in the ""docking station"" entry). If you like, I can get Jean to do the math on how much we would be saving, if anything.  My machine on 47 is really out of date.  Someone else can use my brand new computer on 41 though. 
First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that used to be IT. It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint. Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff. I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute. Drew Fossum 11/19/2000 06:32 PM 
Susan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat about the deals, so please give me a call Mon. AM and let me know what you know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an LFT deal.  DF Mary Kay Miller 11/19/2000 07:39 AM 
We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK Mary Darveaux 11/16/2000 05:34 PM

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because they are ""unconscionable.""  There are several examples in consumer law and employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains struck at arms length. Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some looking, please let me know if you've found anything. 
As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some reading and here are my thoughts. The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act. Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that ""any rate, charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or classification"" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but ""fixed"" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable... In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable.  ""Just and reasonable"" has been interpreted in many different contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means. As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably. However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a more in-depth report. 
I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference. The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in protests. I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail me if you have questions. 
Drew -- I worked with Jeff on this draft so it already contains my comments. 
For your information.  The outcome was great for TW because the Cal. PUC adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.  The outcome is not so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement. The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of the competing settlements. I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have questions. S. 
Here is the attachment... 
Attached is my draft of a request for rehearing.  It incorporates Mr. Stojic's and Mr. Kelly's initial comments.  Please review it and let me know if you have any comments on or before Tuesday afternoon (I will be out of the office Monday).  Thank you! 
Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me... The problem: As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate,"" and the additional frustrating language ""[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ..""  At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above. However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language. Why the problem exists (you may already know): Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates.  ""[T]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
Do you know of any reason we can't do this?  I'm doing research right now but am not finding anything on point. 
Rich, Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to operate their Griffith system.  We can ""hedge"" our proposal based on the need to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be. 
Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20 going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff= =20 filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that= =20 recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or= =20 2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow= ed=20 to charge market based rates. The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la= ck=20 of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20 prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20 market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in= =20 TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the= =20 price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20 possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our= =20 system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper= s=20 to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff. Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I= n=20 the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates. *** To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20 request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20 showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds= =20 all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma= ke=20 the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect. =20 Application for declaratory order must include: 1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20 treatment.  I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service. 2.  A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20 necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to= =20 the services at issue.  The Commission requires a narrow definition of the= =20 market=01(""firm transportation"" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp= oses=20 we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20 Thoreau).  We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o= ther=20 pipelines are a ""good substitute"" only if shippers can obtain the same=20 quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such= =20 service at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20 10%.

Transportation alternatives are only good alternatives= =20 if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they= =20 used TW.  Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good= =20 alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20 quantity. 3.

HHI is calculated by adding up the total market share and= =20 squaring it.  There is a presumption of no ease of entry for transportation= =20 services  because of the expense involved in constructing facilities. 
Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested by the Commission. I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I do not expect the agreement to change significantly. 
Can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues I raised last week? If you can do it tomorrow, let me know what times you are not available and 
We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing. The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What exactly do we mean by ""no additional cost...unless through the allocation process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel""??   Can someone help me with this? Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright. However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language.  Or they could tell us to remove the ""subject to transportation and fuel"" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer. However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC. Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated. 
Sounds like 2:00 will work for everyone; Drew, we will call you from Steve's 
Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to you now so that you could start working on it.

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright. However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language.  Or they could tell us to remove the ""subject to transportation and fuel"" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer. However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC. Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated. 
Can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues I raised last week? If you can do it tomorrow, let me know what times you are not available and

My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here: ** In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made public. FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on the occurrence of certain events. FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996). ** In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not: the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a different footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosure requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in a competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipeline exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that competition is from other pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements. There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases. Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if I find anything.

Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested by the Commission. I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I do not expect the agreement to change significantly. 
Mary Kay, here is my proposed ""fix"" for paragraph 1 b.  ...running it by yo= u=20 just to make sure I understood your message correctly.  Let me know if this= =20 is OK.

However, it was not Transwestern=01,s intent t= o so=20 limit the availability of recourse service.

My experience with the February deals this week has shown me that we need to improve our system of communication on negotiated rate deals. I think a simple checklist for the marketers, legal & reg. would help. Here's what I suggest: - Marketer:  Work with Susan on negotiated rate contract language.  E-mail draft of contract to Glen, Mary, Susan, Mary Kay and Drew for information and for sign-off by Legal and Regulatory prior to sending to the shipper. - Mary and Susan -- have a telephone conversation to confirm that a filing needs to be made, and if so when.  If a filing does not need to be made immediately, note filing date on both Mary's and Susan's calendars (and on Filing Log). - Marketer:  Contract must be executed at least one day before gas flow. Once contract is executed, immediately (1) fax it to Mary at 402-398-7006 and (2) make sure the contract representative (Linda Trevino?) knows that it is a negotiated rate deal and needs to be posted on the transactional report. - Mary?  Susan?:  Contact Linda Trevino to let her know the negotiated rate tariff page that should be reference on the transactional report. -  Mary/Glen:  Draft negotiated rate filing and have Susan or Maria review. Rate language in tariff should be identical to contract negotiated rate language.  Send to D.C. for filing. Let me know if I've left anything out, and I'll get this edited, spiffed up, etc. and circulate it to the marketers so we can get through April and all other future deals without a hitch. 
See the attached.  The notice assumes Calpine's bid is not binding. 
I could not remember where we were in the process of reviewing these posting & bidding procedures so I am sending them around one last time -- if anyone has any further comments please let me know. 
For your comments. 
Please see the attached and let me know your comments as soon as possible.

Couldn't stand the suspense, could you.  In case Janet was not able to send you what you needed, here they  are: (final) (still need to look at) 
As you'll see in the Legal bullets, TW Commercial has asked me to look into the following issue. As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from Needles by Dec. 2001. TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity. Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their primary point to Needles. The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers, rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to sell out the expansion space. I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find. If you have comments in the meantime, please let me know.  We may need to set up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks. 
As you know, we are still waiting for FERC to issue the necessary certificate authority for the Southwest Gas/TW interconnect.  Ideally, the interconnect facilities would be approved so that they could be constructed by the Gallup in-service date.  Two of our Gallup shippers, Sempra and Reliant, have provisions in their Gallup contracts giving them the option to change their primary delivery point to the proposed Southwest Gas interconnect.  The TW commercial group approached me about a motion to expedite based on this contractual right.  (Keith, I know we've spoken about this before with Lorraine).  Lorraine called her business contact at Reliant, and Reliant's regulatory counsel in D.C. called me today to get more information.  He sounded very positive about filing a motion to expedite a decision in this proceeding and I sent him the relevant background information to get him started.  Getting Sempra to consider filing a similar motion might be more difficult, but Jeff Fawcett is going to work on his business contact there. I am going to put together and circulate a motion or letter to FERC from TW, stating that TW's ability to provide service to its shippers will be affected unless certificate authority is granted soon.  Any comments in the meantime -- let me know. 
Here's a draft of a letter asking for expeditious treatment of SWGas's application.  Let me know your comments by Wednesday afternoon if possible. Thanks. 
The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period.""  In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.) 
The Commercial Group has been discussing with PNM the possibility of entering into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of PNM's system between Blanco and Rio Puerco.  This would effectively operate as an expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B. In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet all the Texas Eastern criteria. I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of ""Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. ___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not guaranteeing a shipper ""daily"" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date. Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board. Thanks. 
Nothing in my research has indicated that a specific agreement is required in order to make this filing.  While it is true that one of the reasons FERC rejected the NNG filing in which we sought authority to hold capacity on unspecified pipelines was because it was too general, the Commission never stated that pipelines must file specific deals in order to comport with the Texas Eastern requirements.  I believe that the filing is specific enough to address the Commission's concerns because we have narrowed it down to a specific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a constraint on TW's system. The Commission did not require us to have an agreement with PG&E for Market Center services, and in fact we did not have a deal in place when we made our filing.   While I'm sure it's true that having a specific deal in place would make our filing even more convincing, the Commercial Group would like to maximize their flexibility to acquire capacity on PNM instead of having to ask permission for each deal they do with PNM, which is why we would prefer to use the same strategy we successfully employed in our Market Center services filing. On the Hinshaw issue -- I will forward you the relevant e-mail chain from last week. 
I received several comments from you, and I believe we've resolved the legal issue (PNM's Hinshaw status).  Any other comments? (Mary Kay, the answer to your question is that Lorraine has been discussing a rate with PNM, and the amount of capacity they have available is 10,000.)   Mary Kay and Mary, when do you think would be a reasonable time to expect to file this, given the Order 637 filings we're working on? I've attached my draft again in case you need it. Thanks. 
Today Christine Stokes will be circulating the discount letter for the USGT deal to the usual TW personnel for approval.  Since the revenue sharing mechanism agreed to by the parties creates a negotiated rate, we will need to make the appropriate filing before the April 1 effective date. Attached are 3 documents:  1) cover letter (nearly identical to NNG's), 2) tariff sheets and 3) a copy of the discount letter for your reference.  (Glen and Mary, please put my draft of the tariff sheets into the usual tariff sheet format.  I hope the columns line up on my draft  -- if it is confusing, let me know and I will fax you a copy.) Please let me know your comments as soon as possible...preferably by close of business Tuesday.  Thank you. 
FYI 
See the attached.  Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think. 
SoCal's protest is ludicrous. I will work on a response. By the way, SoCal has actually been remarkably helpful in reaching agreement on a settlement -- which we just signed -- in the California GIR proceeding. 
Here it is.  Please let me know your comments today.  Thanks. 
Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m. if possible. 
FYI 
The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not harmful to the compressor for the short term. It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any further feedback. TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit piping. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage. The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor. It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment or apply stress to the compressor nozzles. James Pfeffer 
Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail anyway! Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything interesting happens I'll let you know. 
Please take a look at this and let me know whether it accurately reflects what you discussed with ECS.  I'm reviewing it now and will let you know my comments soon.  They want to sign this up tomorrow. 
Susan, Attached is the supplement to the gas letter which increases the amount of gas TW delivers to the LLC. Please review and let me know. 
P.S. If it's OK with you I will plan to attend the Energy Seminar on Feb. 10-11 (see 2d half of Lorna's e-mail) 
Marathon and Phillips Join Protest Two more shippers have joined Amoco and Burlington Resources in their joint protest against El Paso?s decision to sell to Enron 1.2 Bcf of excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. Marathon and Phillips have joined in the protest, attacking the entire deal as anti-competitive. The protesters hope FERC will force El Paso to begin again with capacity assignments. Amoco and Burlington had already protested the deal two weeks ago at FERC, when they claimed the sale would violate El Paso?s rate case settlement and tariff. The shippers argue that El Paso was trying to sell part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than PG&E/Topock), which the settlement prohibits. The settlement was intended to protect PG&E and allow it to access service. If this capacity is delivered at other points such as SoCal/Topock, it could add to the glut at that point, the protesters argued. El Paso and Enron stand to gain if the basis differential between the San Juan Basin and California remains large. Marathon and Phillips say that Enron and El Paso can manipulate that basis differential because between them and their affiliates they control all the excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. ______________________________________________________________________ Energy Seminars New 2000 Dates!

Speculator long positions now outnumber short positions by 1.4 to 1 compared with a ratio of 2.9 to 1 two weeks earlier and 3.8 to 1 four weeks earlier. Prices peaked at a post-Gulf-War high of $27.15 a barrel November 22nd and ended the year at $25.60. Long positions in crude oil futures on the NYMEX held by hedge funds and large speculators were 44,233 on December 28th, little changed from 44,693 on December 14th, according to the CFTC. Speculator short positions doubled, though, to 31,868 from 15,364. Speculators also became less bullish about both gasoline and heating oil as their short positions increased much more than the long positions did during the two-week period. The ratio of longs to shorts in gasoline fell to about 3-to-2 from 20-to-1. For natural gas, speculators increased their overall bet that gas prices would fall. They had placed bets for rising gas prices from April until mid-November, when a lack of severe cold weather demand pulled prices down from a two-year high. The following table shows the changes in speculator positions for crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and natural gas futures.

The transaction is expected to close in February. The sale includes natural gas reserves totaling approximately 1.1 Tcf, 6,500 production wells, and 4,000 miles of pipeline network in Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Sale of the exploration and production business is the first step in The Statoil Group?s overall plan of complete divestment of Statoil Energy. Statoil Energy?s remaining businesses, power generation, energy marketing and trading,  will be offered for sale in a separate process starting later this month. The divestment plan is part of Statoil?s overall restructuring program to concentrate on its core business activities: exploration and production in Norway and other selected areas of the world; the European natural gas and energy business; crude oil trading, refining and marketing; and petrochemicals.

EPRIsolutions is a for-profit subsidiary created to hasten the application of EPRI technologies already developed through decades of collaborative research. EPRIsolutions will work directly with our customers to select, install and support the EPRI technologies most suitable for their particular needs. Many of the services offered will be performed by the staff of EPRI?s Technology Application Centers located throughout the US. For example, the Engineering and Test Centers in Lenox, Mass. and Haslet, Tex. can provide audits of utility power delivery systems to identify weaknesses before they lead to outages. The Maintenance and Diagnostics Center in Charlotte, N.C. can help customers save on the cost of operating and maintaining their fossil-fired power plants. As an example of how such integrated services will be offered, EPRIsolutions can help customers adapt and install the powerful, sophisticated software packages now available for load forecasting, environmental risk assessment, and retail market management. In some cases, EPRIsolutions will go one step further by acting as an application service provider for companies that want to outsource data-intensive operations. The first such ASP activity will be on-line monitoring and diagnosis of water chemistry for several nuclear power plants. EPRIsolutions is being formed through the merger of two existing subsidiaries, EPRICSG and EPRIGEN, which were created to allow EPRI to conduct proprietary R&D on behalf of individual funders, who would retain rights to the intellectual property involved. In addition to continuing this activity, EPRIsolutions takes on the function of providing customized technology application and consulting services. Such private-benefit work lies beyond the scope of EPRI's tax-exempt, collaborative research mission and thus requires the use of a taxable subsidiary. ______________________________________________________________________ HEAD?S UP? PRICES DOWN! Natural gas prices have fallen to $2.40/MMBtu from $3.20/MMBtu just last month. Storage injections still outweigh storage withdrawals. Where will prices go? Depends on the weather. If it is warm in Houston and New York City over the Thanksgiving holidays, will prices continue to head south? Under those conditions, they have since 1993.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Southwest Gas Corporation (SWG).  SWG shall enter into a 10 year agreement  for 14,000 Dth/d of seasonal (November through March) capacity effective November 1, 2000.  The transport rate of $.15/Dth/d shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d.  The primary path shall be from Tranwestern's  East of Thoreau (EOT) Area  to the SWG Interconnect located in the East of California Area. Alternate receipt point rights shall be from Tranwestern's EOT Area and from the Bloomfield Compressor.   SWG ROFR rights shall be wiaved. In additionTranswestern shall propose  to retain revenues generated by capacity release at rates higher than the effective contract's discount rate. (Please note that the FTS-1 Appendix A - not shown here with the discount letter-  specifically indicates 0 MMcf/d capacity for the April through October period.  Therefore, even though the $.1500/MMBtu rate in Paragraph 3 of the discount letter does not indicate the rate is a ""seasonal rate"", the effective billing to SWG shall be seasonal.) Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.   All Officer approvals shall be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval. 
Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably (i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.

Spoke with PNM's counsel (Jay Golub) this morning.  He recognizes that PNM needs to get the relevant info to FERC in some form or fashion and would like us to tell him who at FERC is assigned to this proceeding so that he can talk with them, find out what exactly they need, etc.  He said they would probably be willing to send FERC something in writing if it might eliminate the need for a technical conference.  Donna--as I've indicated in my voice mail to you, just let me know who Jay needs to contact, and I'll call him back. Thanks.

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement. Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues. I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks. 
So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached. If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other. Thank you.

Drew, I thought you would be interested in this research memo from our law clerk. 
Susan, Per your request, I have attached a brief memo concerning capacity option exemptions and regulations.  If you have any questions or comments you would like to discuss before the 3 p.m. meeting please do not hesitate to contact me.  If the offer still stands, I would like to attend this afternoon's meeting. Brian Ext. 37629 
Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present. 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale. 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year. 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option. 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether. 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance. 6.  Timeline: - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week) - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing) - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron) - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on) - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet) If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to get a new draft out by next Friday a.m. 
Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to the agreement. I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date. Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in order to get the information you need. Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached before next Wednesday if possible. Thank you. 
Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several minor ""sentence structure"" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been included. Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596). The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter: 1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts. 2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper. Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area. The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis. 
FYI 
Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we always do). If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate. If you have any questions, let me know. 
Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week. Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14. The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows: Final draft comments   Friday, July 14 Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26 Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27 FERC filing    Monday, July 31 Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank you. 
Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what we have posted before. One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable Topock space is part of that package. Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call. 
As I have mentioned already a couple of times, the Commercial Group feels it is important to have something to present to customers.  My concern is that if we just tell them about it over lunch or over the phone, something is going to be ignored or lost in the translation, and then we'll have a dozen protests to contend with.  Surely we've presented new services to customers before in advance of filing...if so, how did we go about it? Also, are you OK with filing July 31, or just as soon as we can get a prefiling conference with FERC? 
I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure everything is addressed before filing. Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review beginning TODAY.

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant changes include: - added definition of Counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate - added an example of how options will work I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from the market. Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will have Janet call to determine your availability. 
Thought you'd be interested in the attached. 
Lorraine, Below are some very preliminary regulatory issues that I have identified regarding Transwestern's Transport Option Program.  These concerns may not constitute all of our concerns; I'm sure there will be more as we continue to review this proposal with our commercial people.  Also, they have not been reviewed with management, and may, or may not, represent the ultimate positions that Conoco (or the Indicated Shipper Trial Group) takes in any proceeding before the FERC. Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday.  Both Teddy and I found it to be very helpful and informative.  We look forward to a more detailed description of your proposal, and the ability to discuss it with Transwestern in a future customer meeting.  Please forward this e-mail on to Jeff; I don't have his direct e-mail address. Tentative Regulatory Issues regarding Transwestern's Transport Option Program (""TOP""). 1. Market Based Rates.  To the extent that TW intends to offer the TOP service without a corresponding cost based recourse service, under current FERC policy, TW would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of market power. 2. Comparable Service:  To the extent that TW implements a TOP service, it would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to offer a similar call & put capability in the capacity release market.  As I remember TW's tariffs, this would likely require specific changes to the capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases with a call or put pricing option. 3. Hoarding:  The TOP service should not be a means for any party (particularly an affiliate) to manipulate the transportation market and/or to exert market power by withholding capacity. 4. Reliability:  The TOP service should require sufficient protections to ensure continued, undiminished service to all of TW's existing and future FT customers. 5. Standardized Product:  The terms and conditions for the TOP service should be standardized in order that each TOP service offer is not considered a ""non-conforming"" contract under FERC policy.  The call and put options, and any administrative or operating limitations, should be specifically defined. 6. Non-preferential Service:  TW must ensure that the TOP service is offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable, and in a manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party (particularly an affiliate). 7. Revenue:  Regardless of whether the TOP is a cost or market based rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes. 8. Pilot Program.  Given the precedential nature of this proposal, perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the TOP if it were filed as an experimental program on TW, with a finite life.  This would allow parties to gain experience prior to having all of the Enron pipelines (and others) file for similar authority. Thanks again.

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee. The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know. I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas or questions. As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss their questions?  Let me know what you think. Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting first, and when FERC staff is available to talk. 
I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad. Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder Morgan lawyers. 
Jeff, here's a slightly revised version of my bottom-line answers to Conoco's questions. Am I remembering correctly that this is for internal distribution only? Again, I'll be out until around 10:30 tomorrow but you can reach me on my mobile (713.494.5002) before 9 or after 10 if there's anything you want to discuss.  Drew -- same goes for you. 
Drew -- HH did leave me the new lawyer's name and # so let's discuss whether we should phone him once Howard is safely on the plane to Costa Rica.  In the meantime, Lorraine already asked Meaders for the cases Howard cited, but he said he'd have to consult with his lawyers in order to do that, so I'm sure the answer will be ""no.""  Snooping around at FERC is starting to sound like a good idea, but I'm in uncharted territory here so won't do any of that before discussing it with you.

I'm confused -- are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the Commission's conditions, or an extension of time to file a motion for rehearing? 
Attached is my first try at our motion to extend time.  Your written comments would be appreciated. 
Christine, you need a comma between July and August.  Otherwise this looks fine. Christine Stokes 01/17/2000 08:50 AM 
TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Phillips Petroleum Company.  Phillips has agree to extend their 30,000 Dth/d Ignacio to El Paso/Blanco contract for five years beginning 2/1/2001.  The one-part seasonal rate structure of $.04 (April-Oct) and $.035 (Nov-March) will escalate by $.005  each of the last two years.  Phillips may use a south to north alternate flow path for an incremental $.01 based on actual utilization. Please  approve via REPLY WITH HISTORY. All officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential approval 
Drew, here is a draft of a letter responding to USGT's with regard to the unpaid invoice for alternate points.  Thought I would see if you have any comments before I pass it along to Mr. Fawcett.  With regard to my reference to our Errors in Billing tariff provision, I was torn between backing up my statement vs. pointing them to potentially troublesome language (ie ""mutual mistake""), but figured they would ask for the tariff provision so I included it.  Also, Elsa really attacks us for not billing them previously so I thought I should address that.   Let me know what you think. 
Keith, I believe our strategy is that unless FERC acts negatively on our motion (i.e., orders us to comply), we are just not going to file anything. MKM and DF, please let me know if I am out of line here. I will work on our request for rehearing and try to get a draft to everyone by Thursday (want Fawcett's input on competitive harm and he will not be back in the office until Wed.).  It's not due until 30 days out, but why not get it ready to go early. Keith Petersen 01/24/2000 09:28 AM 
Susan, have we been granted the extension for filing the discounts?  I did not see anything on RIMS this morning.  If not, does Donna need to have something ready for Friday the 28th?  That would be our 15 days.  Please let me know. Keith 
The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the ""deal"" --- or at least the conversations of the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments? 
TRANSWESTERN CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached discount letter for New Mexico Natural Gas, Inc. (NMNG).

Drew, what is BNSF? 
PG&E wants to buy backhaul service! 
The following is a summary of filings by Entergy and SPP in compliance with FERC's March 28, 2001 order in the SPP Partnership RTO proceeding (Dockets Nos. RT01-43-000 and RT01-75-000). Please communicate any comments you have to Christi and me either today or Monday. Background:  FERC found the SPP Partnership RTO proposal to be deficient and ordered the parties to provide additional information.  In compliance, Entergy and SPP made filings on May 25, 2001. Entergy's compliance filing Entergy's filing provides further information on 1) efforts to expand the scope of the RTO (i.e., include others besides Entergy and the Southwest Power Pool), 2) details of the operation of the RTO and 3) congestion management. 1.  Entergy's efforts to expand the RTO:  Discussions with Southern Companies were fruitless as the Southern Companies have determined to pursue the development of a separate RTO.  Entergy entered into an MOU with TVA to negotiate a coordination agreement to address market, seams and coordination issues between TVA and the RTO.  Entergy concludes that ""there does not appear to be an opportunity at this time to develop a combined regional transmission organization that extends beyond the borders of the current SPP members and Entergy,"" though it claims it will continue to pursue an MOU with the Southern Companies. 2.  Proposed RTO protocols:  The filing includes the details of proposed protocols that Entergy and SPP have developed in the following areas: Operating procedures:  The procedures require Transco to operate the system in accordance with NERC operating policy and authorize Transco to perform the post-contingency actions to maintain system security. Ancillary services:   Transco and SPP are each responsible for providing certain ancillary services.  In addition, Transco will obtain and provide to transmission customers other ancillary services such as Black Start Service and Reliability Must Run Service. Scheduling:  A single electronic scheduling system called the RTO_SS will be run by the SPP.  The RTO_SS, which is initiated by the NERC E-tag, provides an electronic mechanism for approval and coordination of schedules among the parties to the transaction.  RTO_SS interfaces with OASIS to retrieve the necessary information to approve schedules. OASIS Protocol:  SPP and Transco will operate a unified OASIS site; the respective responsibilities of SPP and Transco are detailed in the filing. Calculation of ATC:  SPP and Transco will use a single model incorporating the most up-to-date VST (VACAR, Southern, TVA) model into the SPP model for calculating ATC and TTC.  The protocol contains procedures to ensure that the calculations meet certain requirements, for example, compliance with NERC principles, consistency with transmission rights, and coordination with adjoining reliability regions. System Planning:  Entergy describes its system planning process as ""designed to ensure transmission system reliability and non-discriminatory access to the transmission system.""  The planning and expansion process provides for customer input.  The protocol emphasizes coordination with RTO members and non-members.  Transco will be responsible for coordinating planning with transmission customers and other entities within its Control Area. Generation Interconnection:  Entergy and SPP propose to use their current interconnection procedures for their respective systems while they develop a common set of procedures for the RTO.  The filing includes proposed interconnection procedures that the RTO plans to have in place before initial operations begin. Dispute Management:  The filing includes a comprehensive planning dispute management system for use with the proposed RTO transmission planning process. 3.  Congestion Management and Market Design The filing includes proposed ""cornerstone principles"" for 1) the real-time market, 2) the forward market and 3) conversion of existing transmission rights.  Details of these principles are as follows: Real-time market:  Entergy and SPP do not propose any specific plan except that the following general principles will be used by the SPP to design the real time market: - support balanced/unbalanced and covered/uncovered schedules that flow load to take full advantage of spot market resources -  support forward physical transmission rights that function as financial rights and establish priority in cases of TLR -  support real-time LMP pricing as ex-post based on actual total demand and actual total generation -  support the real-time market as an aggregation of  bilateral and spot supplies -  support the RTO's role as physical coordinator responsible for reliability, scheduling, dispatch and SPP load forecasting -  minimize the RTO's need to take a position in the real-time energy markets Forward market:  SPP will issue Financial Congestion Hedges.  Schedules and physical delivery will be permitted without rights.  The holder of an FCH will be paid rents or revenues collected from the transmission customer minus payments made to generators to relieve congestion. Conversion of existing transmission rights:  Existing agreements will not lose benefits.  All firm wholesale and retail customers will be entitled to a share of the FCHs.  All transmission service with the point of withdrawal inside SPP will have the same priority of service.  All transmission service with the point of withdrawal inside SPP will be curtailed on a non-discriminatory basis. SPP's compliance filing SPP's filing includes information that SPP claims demonstrates that the RTO satisfies the Commission's scope and configuration requirements. - SPP submitted data on wholesale energy transactions involving the SPP RTO companies, in an attempt to show that the proposed RT will be able to accommodate the full markets. - It also submitted data showing the relative insignificance of non-Entergy SERC transactions to SPP. - SPP's description of its attempts to include Southern and TVA were similar to that of Entergy.  SPP states it will continue seams discussions with other regions. - SPP also reported on the Section 203 applications of SPP Transmission Owners as required by the Commission.

Susan Scott Lindberg 713.853.0596 sscott3@enron.com *** Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy), acting as agent for Entergy Arkansas, Inc., submits a revised and redesignated interconnection and operating agreement between Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Wrightsville Power Facility, LLC (Wrightsville). Entergy states that this is intended to supersede Entergy Operating Companies Original Service Agreement No. 216 under FERC Electric Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 3. Entergy further states that the revision reflects Wrightsville's revision of its selection of Optional System Upgrades for its facility and corrects the tax gross-up factor noted in the cost estimates in the appendices of the Wrightsville interconnection agreement. Entergy requests an effective date of September 25, 2000, the date on which the original interconnection agreement was deemed by FERC.  (ER01-2300-000)

Today I filed on behalf of EPMI a brief protest of Entergy's proposed overhaul of the ancillary services provisions of its OATT.  The protest focuses on modifications we believe Entergy must make in order for the tariff provisions to be nondiscriminatory. Susan Scott Lindberg 713.853.0596 sscott3@enron.com 
Last week FERC issued an order conditionally accepting two interconnection and operating agreements:  1) Entergy Louisiana and Washington Parish and 2) Entergy Arkansas and GenPower Keo.   The Commission ordered Entergy to revise the credit provision in the agreements (and in Entergy's pro forma IA in its OATT) to provide for crediting of all network upgrades.  This is consistent with a May 2001 FERC order that required Consumers Energy to credit customers for all network upgrade costs, including those incurred to remedy short-circuit or stability related problems. If you want more information please let me know. Susan Scott 
Please see the following summaries of 1) an interconnection agreement between Entergy Gulf States and BASF Fina Petrochemicals, filed July 5  and 2) revisions to an existing Entergy Arkansas agreement, accepted by FERC July 12. If you would like further information, please let me know. Susan Scott x30596 ----- Entergy Services, Inc., on behalf of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.  ER01-2511-000. Interconnection and Operating Agreement. On July 5, 2001, Entergy Services Inc. (Entergy), acting as an agent for Entergy Gulf States, Inc. (Entergy Gulf States), submitted an Interconnection and Operating Agreement with BASF Fina Petrochemicals Limited Partnership (BASF), pursuant to Part 35 of FERC's Regulations. Entergy noted that BASF owns and operates a 75 MW electric generating facility, located adjacent to Entergy Gulf States' transmission system in Jefferson County, Texas. The BASF Interconnection Agreement is being filed pursuant to Entergy's OATT, and does not alter the transmission rates pursuant to the tariff. Notice issued July 10.  Protests due July 26. Entergy Operating Companies. ER01-2300-000. Interconnection Agreement. FERC accepted Entergy Arkansas' revised interconnection agreement with Wrightsville Power Facility, LLC (Wrightsville).  The revisions modify the Optional System Upgrades for the Wrightsville facility and corrects the tax gross-up factor noted in the cost estimates.  The effective date is September 25, 2000, the date on which the original interconnection agreement was approved by FERC. 
On July 17 , 2001, Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. filed a complaint against the Southwest Power Pool, Inc.  Dynegy alleges that the SPP has violated its OATT by unreasonably restricting Point-to-Point Transmission Services customers' right to change of receipt and delivery points on a firm basis.  Specifically, Dynegy complains that SPP unfairly limits changes of receipt and delivery points to those that permanently redirect the reservation (i.e., for the balance of the reservation term).  Dynegy documents several specific instances in which its redirect requests were automatically denied. I will keep you updated on this proceeding; if you would like more details on the complaint in the meantime, please let me know. Susan Scott 
Carolina Power & Light Company and Florida Power Corporation, on July 16, 2001, filed revisions to their Open Access Transmission Tariffs. The modification provides that the Tariffs Generator Interconnection Procedures, Attachment O, apply only in the CP&L zone. The companies state that the purpose of the filing is to correct an April 26, 2001 filing that  inadvertently did not limit the applicability of the Attachment. If you would like more information on this filing, please let me know. Susan Scott 713.853.0596 
On July 20, Entergy filed a two-page supplement to their 2001 Rate Update that addresses transmission service credits.  Entergy states that this information was inadvertently omitted from the previous filing. If you need a copy of the filing, or any further information, please let me know. Susan Scott 713.853.0596 
Entergy filed proposed revisions to its pro forma OATT relating to Ancillary Services Schedules Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6, proposed to be effective August 1, 2001.  Entergy's basic premise is that the pro forma tariff and ancillary services established as part of Entergy's Open Access Transmission Tariff settlement in Docket No. ER95-112 should be changed.  Entergy states that current charges are based on the amount of energy transmitted by Entergy without regard to the amount of capacity and energy Entergy must maintain in order to provide these services, and that these charges should be capacity-based rather than energy-based. EPMI -- among several other parties -- protested the filing. On July 25, FERC issued an order as follows: - Entergy must define the term ""integrated peak load.""  (In its answer to EPMI's protest, Entergy agreed to define the term as the customer's average load over the course of the hour as measured by the appropriate metering). - Issues related to Energy Imbalance Services must be set for hearing, as Entergy has not demonstrated that certain proposed penalties are appropriate.  (EPMI had objected specifically to the proposed CRP penalty). - Issues related to Spinning Reserves and Supplemental Reserves must also be set for hearing. Although most of Entergy's proposed provisions have been set for hearing, FERC is allowing the provisions to become effective August 1, subject to refund.  Additionally, Entergy asked for a settlement judge, so FERC ordered that one be appointed, and encouraged the parties to resolve their differences.  A settlement judge will be appointed by August 9 and will convene a settlement conference.  The judge must submit a report to the Commission by September 24. I will keep you updated.  Let me know if you would like further information. Susan Scott Lindberg x30596 
Carolina Power & Light and Florida Power Corporation submitted tariff revisions in compliance with a Commission order addressing the energy imbalance provisions that apply in CP&L's zone. The proposed revisions include: - return-in-kind provisions for energy imbalances - deletion of the separate capacity charge for undersupply of energy outside the deadband for 10+ hours in a month - a provision that deficient energy will be offset or credited with energy associated with spinning and supplemental reserves. Interventions/protests are due Aug. 15. If you would like further information please contact me. Susan Scott Lindberg 
Here is a revised version of the Red Rock agreement which includes changes suggested by Jeff.  If you've already sent the previous version to shippers, that is perfectly fine, as Jeff's changes should be noncontroversial.  We've just removed the reference to the service request as service requests will be submitted along with each shipper's bid rather than executed simultaneously with the agreement.  This new version more accurately reflects the contracting process for this expansion. 
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL Appropos of Agave's phone message.  Steve was in this loop.  The discount reports are available to anyone who wants them under the Open Records Act.  TK, you indicated that Agave thinks the rates were published somewhere by FERC -- I don't know whether that's true, but the bottom line is that FERC has the information in its files and could publish it any time at wants; we have no control over that.  Let me know if you want me to talk with Agave's lawyers. 
I'm not remembering whether the discount reports are confidential or not, but if they are public (which I think is the case) then I agree with your recommendation.  DF Susan Scott 01/11/2001 04:58 PM 
After doing a little looking into what data about our contracts is publicly available, I've concluded that there is little if any basis for requesting confidential treatment for any of our responses to the FERC's data requests. My chief concern was the pre-637 contracts that are not in our transactional reports.  Most of the discount letters include confidentiality provisions and we're required to seek confidential treatment if required to disclose the contracts.  I was hoping to find that none of the information about these contracts had been disclosed in any public forum.  However, I think our shippers (and TW) would be hard-pressed to claim that the info FERC is requesting is confidential.  These shippers' names and contract rates are disclosed in our monthly discount reports to FERC.  (I assume we do not seek confidential treatment of these reports -- let me know if I'm mistaken.)   Quantities, expiration date and receipt and delivery points for these shippers' contracts appear on the Index of Customers on our website. I would recommend that we not request confidential treatment because I can find no convincing basis for saying this information is confidential. Let me know whether you concur.  Thanks. 
Here it is with the contract number. 
At Drew's request I've drafted the attached language to address the possibility that FERC might change its negotiated rate policy statement or otherwise invalidate the negotiated rate in the contract.  Stan brought this idea up at this morning's staff meeting (for those of you who, like me, weren't in attendance).  Please comment. 
Here's the latest version of the internal posting and bidding procedures for TW.  Note that it still says ""DRAFT"" at the top, as I predict this will go thru at least one more round of fine-tuning before it's officially adopted. 
The question came up yesterday whether a shipper who contracts for firm capacity for a year or more at a negotiated rate is entitled to a ROFR. I've done some checking, and the answer is no, a negotiated rate shipper that entered into a contract after March 27, 2000 does not automatically get ROFR rights.   This was clearly stated by FERC in Order No. 637-A.   It does not matter whether the negotiated rate is above the maximum tariff rate; the contract is still not considered to be ""at maximum rates"" for ROFR purposes. As you know, our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include ROFR rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get ROFR rights. 
Here is a checklist for negotiated rate deals.  It basically just states in writing the procedures we've discussed.  One exception:  Elizabeth, Linda and Michelle, please note that we've decided reference to Sheets Nos. 5B.05, et seq. is sufficient.  If you have questions please let me know.  Thanks! Susan (x30596) 
Please see the attached.  Additions to our current posting are highlighted; deletions are crossed out. The purpose of the revisions is to announce the availability (potentially) of Needles space, set a deadline for bidding (in anticipation of a stampede for the Needles space), state that bids will be evaluated on highest NPV, and to specify a pro rata allocation method.  If you see any problems with this posting, please call me as soon as possible. 
(Sharon -- please fax this to Mary Kay).  Attached for your review is a revised open season posting which incorporates Mary Kay's comments.  Let's try to get this posted tomorrow.  Thanks. 
Legale, please post this today in place of the current TW open season posting. If you have questions, please call me at x30596. 
Here's the agreement to use if your shippers want ROFR. 
Here is the suggested general format for soliciting bids from shippers by phone for the Red Rock expansion.  Drew and Mary Kay have discussed this and have given the go-ahead to start calling. - Bids will be accepted until 5:00, March 2 - Guidelines for bids that meet the threshold for making our project economic are [describe the three ""menu"" alternatives -- $0.60 at 5 years, etc .] - Bids will be evaluated based on highest rate. - Shippers should indicate whether they would be willing to have their bid capacity prorated in case an allocation is necessary. 
Attached is a letter I drafted (with comments from Mary Kay and Drew) reminding shippers that the deadline for bids has passed and that bidding will be opened up to all interested parties.  The consensus was that this letter might help eliminate any misunderstanding about the open season process.  Please send this to your respective shippers (only those who sent a timely response to the open season).  Also attached for your reference is a posting I'm having Toby put on the website. 
In response to a concern Stan brought up yesterday, here is a revised version of the Red Rock form agreement.  It includes the following language: If the Rate is invalidated by a) the FERC's modification of the rules, regulations or policy applicable to Transwestern's negotiated rate authority under the Alternative Rates Policy Statement or b) any order, legislation, or other action by a governmental authority, the transportation rate hereunder shall be the maximum rate set forth in Transwestern's tariff, effective on the date such FERC order or other governmental action is final, except that if the currently effective maximum rate at the time of such invalidation is lower than the Rate, this Agreement and the FTS-1 Agreement shall be terminable at Transwestern's option, as of the date such FERC order or other governmental action is final. The language appears in redlining in the attachment.  This is to provide a starting point for negotiations. Jeff, Steve asked me to draft slightly different language for the Calpine deal you've been working on; see the attachment below.

Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to the agreement. I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date. Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in order to get the information you need. Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached before next Wednesday if possible. Thank you. 
Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we always do). If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate.

Please post the attached notice immediately. (Marketers:  in paragraph 8, I've eliminated the min/max language since we're willing to do a rate over the max. In paragraph 10, I've changed the tiebreak procedure.) 
Please post the attached notice immediately. (Marketers:  in paragraph 8, I've eliminated the min/max language since we're willing to do a rate over the max. In paragraph 10, I've changed the tiebreak procedure.) 
Please post. 
Here is the final version being posted; it is changed very slightly from yesterday and still has the max res. + commodity/100% throughput. 
Re paragraph 8:  I just spoke with Mary Kay and Drew.  Because of FERC policy on negotiated rates, we have to be careful to characterize paragraph 8 as a bid evaluation method only.  Just because a shipper hits the max rate button does not mean they are committing to 100% throughput.  In order to commit to 100% throughput, they need to submit a 2-part bid and indicate 100% 
I forgot to tell you at our staff meeting that on December 27 FERC approved the tariff sheet we filed authorizing TW to grant contractual ROFR rights to FTS-1 shippers that do not automatically qualify for such a right.  In other words, for contracts that are not maximum rate for more than a year, we can still agree to give the shipper a ROFR without having to file the contract as a material deviation. 
Here is my proposed webtext for FTS-1.  Note I've left blanks for you to fill in points. 
Michelle:  here is the text for LFT and ITS-1, plus the FTS-1 again because I made some slight modifications.  Note my question on the LFT description. I'll do the daily FTS-1 text and send it to you in the next hour or so.  Lisa Lees called and said she's sending me something; I will look at this weekend if not today. 
Michelle:  FTS-1 (daily) text attached.  The only difference between this and the FTS-1 text is in the ""Term"" portion of the form agreement. My contact info for Monday: Mobile: 713-494-5002 D.C. office (after 12:30-ish):  202-828-3360 (meeting with Nancy Bagot) Tuesday I'll be out of pocket most of the day but will check voice mail when I can. 
Mary Kay -- This is a provision that is favorable to both TW and shippers in the context of risk management of index deals.  If their rates were anything other than pure index - to- index, then they would have an unbalanced cash flow and could be upside down.  This is the only real way these deals can work, and the only way the parties could have expected to do the deals. -- Susan and Jeff 
Just wanted to know I am working on your behalf... I'll let you know what Shelley says. I really feel a need to keep the EOL guys honest, so a full-fledged agreement would probably not be overkill.  But in reality, a term sheet is probably almost as good. 
Shelley, I understand that there is a concern about TW having a written agreement with EOL without the other two pipelines having an agreement. From my perspective, TW needs an agreement because TW is uniquely situated. Here's why. - My understanding is that TW is the only pipeline that has been asked to pay a fee. - The developers Michelle Lokay and I have been talking to seem very uncertain about exactly what the fee covers. -  $50,000 is a lot of money to Transwestern. -   Transwestern has a recent history of not getting what it thought it had bargained for from affiliated companies, and would appreciate our trying to protect them. I am not trying to create extra work for anyone.  I am just a little confused about why a contract for TW would necessitate a contract for the other 2 companies.  If you could help me understand, I would appreciate it. If the consensus is that we feel strongly that TW should not have a written agreement, then I would at least insist on a detailed letter of intent or term sheet.  This would force both sides to think ahead about what is expected.  (And, as a practical matter, it's highly unlikely that we're going to take legal action for breach of contract against an affiliate...) Thanks. 
Here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement.

Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time). My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5). If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate. Any questions -- give me a call. S.

Susan, please review the following IOS posting.  Thanks. 
Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing. There are a couple of important changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""  At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved. The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case. I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to discuss the following topics: 1)  Your comments and questions on this draft, 2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 4)  Comments received from shippers thus far. I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting time. I will be out Mon. and Tues. 
Here is a chart cross-referencing Gas Daily price points with points of TW, for purposes of imbalance valuation.  If you have questions call Jeff or me. 
Susan, As requested in yesterday's meeting, Lindy and I came up with the attached matrix of prices for purposes of valuing TW imbalances.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
Terminability of Val Verde interconnect agreement 
I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take the following steps: 1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since gone month-to-month.) 2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in

Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a summary of the comments. Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage. TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that applies to all interstate pipelines. Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff. Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate. Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require TW to do so in a final order. Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC filing by mid-September. 
Michelle, here is what I faxed to Cathy.  Drew and Regulatory have approved it.  I did not hear back from Cathy.  If she wants any further changes, you might want to run them by Drew. 
The Commission issued a draft order in Docket No. RP00-249 today accepting TW's tariff sheets to acquire offsystem capacity on PNM, effective Sept. 15, subject to the following conditions: The tariff sheets are accepted for a 2-year period subject to TW's refiling within 15 days of the order to 1) limit its acquisition to a max. of 40,000 MMBtu/day and 2) to limit the firm service to the non-peak summer period. Also, TW must file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2-year period detailing what impact, if any, the proposal has had on the market. After the report is filed, parties may comment on the report. We agreed to the 40,000 MMBtu limit but not to the non-peak period or the 20-year limit.  Let's discuss whether we should seek rehearing of the order. 
I have copies of interventions and protests that have been filed in response to TW's Order 637 compliance filing.  If you want copies, let me know.  In 
Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement. Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues. I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks. 
For your information.  If you have any questions, let me know... 
Attached is summary of protestor comments to TW's Order 637 compliance filing.  It will be attached to the Weekly Report as well. 
Michelle:  be sure that Southern describes (generally) the assets being sold, and lists the contract #s, in its letter to us. 
I made the changes you asked for, plus a minor wording change in section 1 about effective date. This needs to be executed in duplicate originals, so print two. If you have any questions, let me know! 
Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in the PNM capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the summer months.  The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to consider our request.  In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our 
I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference. The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in protests. I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail me if you have questions. 
Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to the agreement. I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date. Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in order to get the information you need. Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached before next Wednesday if possible. Thank you. 
Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we always do). If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate. 
Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week. Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14. The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows: Final draft comments   Friday, July 14 Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26 Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27 FERC filing    Monday, July 31 Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank you. 
Please post the attached notice immediately. (Marketers:  in paragraph 8, I've eliminated the min/max language since we're willing to do a rate over the max. In paragraph 10, I've changed the tiebreak procedure.) 
Please post the attached notice immediately. (Marketers:  in paragraph 8, I've eliminated the min/max language since we're willing to do a rate over the max. In paragraph 10, I've changed the tiebreak procedure.) 
Please post. 
Here is the final version being posted; it is changed very slightly from yesterday and still has the max res. + commodity/100% throughput. 
Re paragraph 8:  I just spoke with Mary Kay and Drew.  Because of FERC policy on negotiated rates, we have to be careful to characterize paragraph 8 as a bid evaluation method only.  Just because a shipper hits the max rate button does not mean they are committing to 100% throughput.  In order to commit to 100% throughput, they need to submit a 2-part bid and indicate 100% 
Here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement. 
Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing. There are a couple of important changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""  At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved. The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case. I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to discuss the following topics: 1)  Your comments and questions on this draft, 2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 4)  Comments received from shippers thus far. I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting time. I will be out Mon. and Tues. 
Here is a chart cross-referencing Gas Daily price points with points of TW, for purposes of imbalance valuation.  If you have questions call Jeff or me.

Terminability of Val Verde interconnect agreement 
I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take the following steps: 1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since gone month-to-month.) 2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in

Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a summary of the comments. Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.

Here's the latest version of the internal posting and bidding procedures for TW.  Note that it still says ""DRAFT"" at the top, as I predict this will go thru at least one more round of fine-tuning before it's officially adopted.

In our negotiated rate proceeding, the Commission issued a Section 5 ""show cause"" order.  Specifically, TW must, within 10 days of the order, show cause why its actions in offering the negotiated rate contracts (Reliant, Richardson, BP, Sempra, Astra) was not in contravention of Commission policy.  TW must explain the availability of firm capacity on TW's system, and how it has the firm capacity to move gas under the transactions under investigation, yet provide recourse service without interruption.  Drew, Maria and I will work with outside counsel to file the necessary pleading.  I'll get a copy of the order to each of you. 
Attached is a letter I drafted (with comments from Mary Kay and Drew) reminding shippers that the deadline for bids has passed and that bidding will be opened up to all interested parties.  The consensus was that this letter might help eliminate any misunderstanding about the open season process.  Please send this to your respective shippers (only those who sent a timely response to the open season).  Also attached for your reference is a posting I'm having Toby put on the website. 
In response to a concern Stan brought up yesterday, here is a revised version of the Red Rock form agreement.  It includes the following language: If the Rate is invalidated by a) the FERC's modification of the rules, regulations or policy applicable to Transwestern's negotiated rate authority under the Alternative Rates Policy Statement or b) any order, legislation, or other action by a governmental authority, the transportation rate hereunder shall be the maximum rate set forth in Transwestern's tariff, effective on the date such FERC order or other governmental action is final, except that if the currently effective maximum rate at the time of such invalidation is lower than the Rate, this Agreement and the FTS-1 Agreement shall be terminable at Transwestern's option, as of the date such FERC order or other governmental action is final. The language appears in redlining in the attachment.  This is to provide a starting point for negotiations. Jeff, Steve asked me to draft slightly different language for the Calpine deal you've been working on; see the attachment below. 
Michelle -- I took the short & sweet approach.  Let me know if you have any questions! 
Here is a checklist for negotiated rate deals.  It basically just states in writing the procedures we've discussed.  One exception:  Elizabeth, Linda and Michelle, please note that we've decided reference to Sheets Nos. 5B.05, et seq. is sufficient.  If you have questions please let me know.  Thanks! Susan (x30596) 
Here is a notice letter to Conoco terminating Agreements 20835, 20747 and 20748. Please be advised that under the 365-day notice provision of 20835, there is a chance that Conoco could take the position that we have given notice one day too late and the contract therefore does not terminate until the end of the first renewal term, or February 28, 2003.  Ditto for the other two agreements (except they could only claim the agreements are effective until the end of March 2002).  To be on the safe side, I've included an ""acknowledged and agreed to"" signature block (even though Conoco is not required to consent to a timely notice of termination).  Any questions -- let me know. 
Here is a revised version of the Red Rock agreement which includes changes suggested by Jeff.  If you've already sent the previous version to shippers, that is perfectly fine, as Jeff's changes should be noncontroversial.  We've just removed the reference to the service request as service requests will be submitted along with each shipper's bid rather than executed simultaneously with the agreement.  This new version more accurately reflects the contracting process for this expansion. 
Here is an agreement that you can provide your shippers for the Red Rock expansion. The agreement assumes the negotiated rate applies to use of all primary and alternate points.  If you have any questions please let me know. 
Yesterday the Commission issued a draft order on Transwestern's request for rehearing in Docket No. RP00-249.  We had asked the the Commission remove the restriction on the months in which TW can acquire capacity on PNM.  The order reads, in pertinent part: At the present time, firm capacity is not available on PNM's system during peak periods, since all firm capacity on PNM's system is subject to recall by PNM in order to maintain service to core customers.  If in the future, however, circumstances change and Transwestern is able to acquire firm capacity on the PNM system which is not subject to recall or other prior commitment, Transwestern can do so.  Transwestern will be required to file a revised tariff sheet to reflect thte determinations made in this order before it can acquire such furm capacity during the peak period.

OK, see whether this accurately reflects the deal. 
The question came up yesterday whether a shipper who contracts for firm capacity for a year or more at a negotiated rate is entitled to a ROFR. I've done some checking, and the answer is no, a negotiated rate shipper that entered into a contract after March 27, 2000 does not automatically get ROFR rights.   This was clearly stated by FERC in Order No. 637-A.   It does not matter whether the negotiated rate is above the maximum tariff rate; the contract is still not considered to be ""at maximum rates"" for ROFR purposes. As you know, our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include ROFR rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get ROFR rights. 
Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for 
The attached letter agreement reflects my discussion with Drew about the marketing fee.  The FTS-1 Agreement will just be a plain vanilla agreement (i.e., minus the marketing fee language) and the parties will execute the attached instead.  Questions or comments -- let me know.

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that applies to all interstate pipelines. Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff. Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate. Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require TW to do so in a final order. Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC filing by mid-September. 
Michelle, here is what I faxed to Cathy.  Drew and Regulatory have approved it.  I did not hear back from Cathy.  If she wants any further changes, you might want to run them by Drew. 
The Commission issued a draft order in Docket No. RP00-249 today accepting TW's tariff sheets to acquire offsystem capacity on PNM, effective Sept. 15, subject to the following conditions: The tariff sheets are accepted for a 2-year period subject to TW's refiling within 15 days of the order to 1) limit its acquisition to a max. of 40,000 MMBtu/day and 2) to limit the firm service to the non-peak summer period. Also, TW must file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2-year period detailing what impact, if any, the proposal has had on the market. After the report is filed, parties may comment on the report. We agreed to the 40,000 MMBtu limit but not to the non-peak period or the 20-year limit.  Let's discuss whether we should seek rehearing of the order. 
I have copies of interventions and protests that have been filed in response to TW's Order 637 compliance filing.  If you want copies, let me know.  In 
Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement. Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues. I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks. 
For your information.  If you have any questions, let me know... 
Attached is summary of protestor comments to TW's Order 637 compliance filing.  It will be attached to the Weekly Report as well. 
Michelle:  be sure that Southern describes (generally) the assets being sold, and lists the contract #s, in its letter to us. 
I made the changes you asked for, plus a minor wording change in section 1 about effective date. This needs to be executed in duplicate originals, so print two. If you have any questions, let me know! 
Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in the PNM capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the summer months.  The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to consider our request.  In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our 
I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference. The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in protests. I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail me if you have questions. 
Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to the agreement. I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date. Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in order to get the information you need. Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached before next Wednesday if possible. Thank you. 
Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we always do). If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate. 
Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week. Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14. The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows: Final draft comments   Friday, July 14 Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26 Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27 FERC filing    Monday, July 31 Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank you. 
Please post the attached notice immediately. (Marketers:  in paragraph 8, I've eliminated the min/max language since we're willing to do a rate over the max. In paragraph 10, I've changed the tiebreak procedure.) 
Please post the attached notice immediately. (Marketers:  in paragraph 8, I've eliminated the min/max language since we're willing to do a rate over the max. In paragraph 10, I've changed the tiebreak procedure.) 
Please post. 
Here is the final version being posted; it is changed very slightly from yesterday and still has the max res. + commodity/100% throughput. 
Re paragraph 8:  I just spoke with Mary Kay and Drew.  Because of FERC policy on negotiated rates, we have to be careful to characterize paragraph 8 as a bid evaluation method only.  Just because a shipper hits the max rate button does not mean they are committing to 100% throughput.  In order to commit to 100% throughput, they need to submit a 2-part bid and indicate 100% 
I forgot to tell you at our staff meeting that on December 27 FERC approved the tariff sheet we filed authorizing TW to grant contractual ROFR rights to FTS-1 shippers that do not automatically qualify for such a right.  In other words, for contracts that are not maximum rate for more than a year, we can still agree to give the shipper a ROFR without having to file the contract as a material deviation. 
Here is my proposed webtext for FTS-1.  Note I've left blanks for you to fill in points. 
Michelle:  here is the text for LFT and ITS-1, plus the FTS-1 again because I made some slight modifications.  Note my question on the LFT description. I'll do the daily FTS-1 text and send it to you in the next hour or so.  Lisa Lees called and said she's sending me something; I will look at this weekend if not today. 
Michelle:  FTS-1 (daily) text attached.  The only difference between this and the FTS-1 text is in the ""Term"" portion of the form agreement. My contact info for Monday: Mobile: 713-494-5002 D.C. office (after 12:30-ish):  202-828-3360 (meeting with Nancy Bagot) Tuesday I'll be out of pocket most of the day but will check voice mail when I can. 
Here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement. 
Mary Kay -- This is a provision that is favorable to both TW and shippers in the context of risk management of index deals.  If their rates were anything other than pure index - to- index, then they would have an unbalanced cash flow and could be upside down.  This is the only real way these deals can work, and the only way the parties could have expected to do the deals. -- Susan and Jeff 
Just wanted to know I am working on your behalf... I'll let you know what Shelley says. I really feel a need to keep the EOL guys honest, so a full-fledged agreement would probably not be overkill.  But in reality, a term sheet is probably almost as good. 
Shelley, I understand that there is a concern about TW having a written agreement with EOL without the other two pipelines having an agreement. From my perspective, TW needs an agreement because TW is uniquely situated. Here's why. - My understanding is that TW is the only pipeline that has been asked to pay a fee. - The developers Michelle Lokay and I have been talking to seem very uncertain about exactly what the fee covers. -  $50,000 is a lot of money to Transwestern. -   Transwestern has a recent history of not getting what it thought it had bargained for from affiliated companies, and would appreciate our trying to protect them. I am not trying to create extra work for anyone.  I am just a little confused about why a contract for TW would necessitate a contract for the other 2 companies.  If you could help me understand, I would appreciate it. If the consensus is that we feel strongly that TW should not have a written agreement, then I would at least insist on a detailed letter of intent or term sheet.  This would force both sides to think ahead about what is expected.  (And, as a practical matter, it's highly unlikely that we're going to take legal action for breach of contract against an affiliate...) Thanks. 
The question came up yesterday whether a shipper who contracts for firm capacity for a year or more at a negotiated rate is entitled to a ROFR. I've done some checking, and the answer is no, a negotiated rate shipper that entered into a contract after March 27, 2000 does not automatically get ROFR rights.   This was clearly stated by FERC in Order No. 637-A.   It does not matter whether the negotiated rate is above the maximum tariff rate; the contract is still not considered to be ""at maximum rates"" for ROFR purposes. As you know, our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include ROFR rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get ROFR rights. 
OK, see whether this accurately reflects the deal. 
Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time). My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5). If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate. Any questions -- give me a call. S.

I think that ultimately I would feel OK about giving them #1 and #2 under the circumstances, if these guys are really that concerned about these issues.  I really don't think TW is ever going to breach its confidentiality obligations.  I need to get Drew's clearance for Colorado law; I'll get back to you. Gerald Nemec@ECT 09/11/2000 07:17 PM 
Susan,  Tri-States comments.  I plan to give them Colorado law but to discuss the other two with them.  Let me know your thoughts. 
Gerald: Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows: 1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well. 2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential, punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we should have three years to commence an action after termination. 3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is familiar with. Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is reasonable and appropriate. Thanks, Dave Nocera 
Pursuant to your request. 
I received my copy of ECS's April 13 letter to TW and noticed it was addressed to the wrong Susan Scott.  She usually does forward me the mail she receives by mistake.  But since the information that we occasionally send each other thru interoffice mail for these compressor deals is more important than most, I thought I'd let you know my correct room # is 4788.  Also, when sending e-mail make sure you address it to Susan Scott at ET&S, not ECT. This will ensure I receive everything you send me.  Thanks!

Just so you can see how this is evolving... I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because it sounds like we are buying/selling gas. I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only information she still needs from us, I think. I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.

Susan, I would like to request 1 final change to the interconnect agreement before execution.  It is a simple change to better clarify the intent of paragraph 3.4 This is how I would like to see it read, 3.4 For a period of two (2) years from the date of the Facilities are completed and placed in-service, EPFS shall be obligated to deliver an average of  12,500 MMBtu/d to TW at the Interconnect Point.  At the completion of the second year from the date the facilities are completed and placed in service, If EPFS has not met the 9.1 Bcf volume  commitment, EPFS will refund $100,000 to TW within thirty (30) days.  At any time during the two (2) year period should EPFS's cumulative delivery to TW at the Inteconnect Point meet or exceed the 9.1 Bcf commitment, EPFS is relieved  of its volumetric and monetary obligation to TW as described in this paragragh 3.4.  .......  rest as originally writen...

given that I don't even know what UAF is, I will plan to attend. 
I just received a copy of a Section 5 complaint filed by SoCal requesting a FERC order 1) determining that the SoCalGas/Topock delivery point is fully subscribed on a firm primary basis, 2) directing El Paso to comply with previous Commission orders that preclude the selling of firm primary capacity at points where none is available and 3) directing El Paso to schedule capacity acquired during an open season (effective Jan. 1, 2000) into SoCal/Topock on a secondary basis only.  SoCal states that it has experienced daily cuts of up to 57% and averaging 25%. 
Maria reminded me that we are required to file a rate case to be effective Nov. 1, 2006. We could file one before then as to non-Current Firm Shippers, but I doubt we will. 
Attached is the final version of the Interconnect Agreement. I've changed Section 4.2 in accordance with our e-mail discussion.

Darin, kindly fill in the appropriate contact information on page 11, have the agreement executed by EPFS in duplicate originals, and return both originals to me.

Jim, if we delete current Section 4.3, then we would like to reinsert the ""negligence"" clauses in Section 4.2 (I don't remember how they got negotiated out in the first place).  So it would read: 4.2  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless EPFS, its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, and agents and servants, contractors and subcontractors (""Indemnified Party"" or ""Indemnified Parties"") from and against that portion of the liabilities, losses, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of TW or its agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations under the terms of this Agreement. b.  EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless TW and its Indemnified Parties from and against that portion of the liabilities, losses, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of EPFS or its agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations under the terms of this Agreement. c.

Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.  Also, the blanks of course need to be filled in for $$ amount and term. Do we have other guaranties in favor of both TW and NNG?  I know we probably do, and I may have even approved them.  But if possible I'd prefer to have two separate guaranties since TW and NNG are separate legal entities.  It is not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to do anything.  If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two agreements, let me know. Ted Chavez 09/28/2000 03:52 PM 
Susan, Can you take a look at the attached guaranty from BP Amoco.  Please give me your comments or approval at your earliest convenience. Additionally, are you still going to Zihuatanejo, Mexico? Thanks, Ted X-37952 
Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument.  I did not go as far as I could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it. 
Nancy, I've prepared the attached outline in response to FERC Staff's request that we provide ""something in writing.""  This is basically just a description of our proposal.  I've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not reading while we're trying to talk to them.  It should be enough information to raise a lot of questions. Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible. Everyone else:  please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to provide something to them tomorrow.

You had a question about the meaning of Section 4.3.  Here's a brief explanation. Section 4.2 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third party for damage caused by negligence of the other party.  I'm OK with eliminating ""stockholders"" and the ""...judgments of any nature..."" clause you two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs a. and b. Section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by EPFS against TW for damage to EPFS's facilities during the term of the agreement. TW is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and DOT standards.  Our policy in interconnect agreements is that if TW complies with these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to EPFS in case of explosion, etc.  In other words, both parties bear the risk attached to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and DOT standards. (By the way, I believe the ""notwithstanding anything in this Article 4 to the contrary"" language should come out; I'm not sure why it's in the draft.) 
Lindy, FERC has consistently held that pipelines may make ""operational"" sales of gas.  Specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain linepack levels.  TW's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine. By contrast, buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function. Let me know if you have further questions. Lindy Donoho 09/20/2000 04:43 PM 
In our Plan meeting, we were discussing UAF and Operation's objective to reduce it.  Operation's objective is a volumetric goal, but we are at risk for the gas price.  It started me thinking about our whole fuel expense. TW's fuel expense is valued on our books at the TW systemwide index.  Should TW be hedging the fuel that we burn?  Jan-Aug, 2000 (acctg months) Y-T-D fuel expense is at $21MM ($2.6MM/month) at a total volume of 6.7 Bcf.  This summer, with high gas prices and Gallup in service, our fuel has been ranging $3.4-3.8MM a month.  Operations has objectives to minimize the fuel use, but not the price. How could we hedge our fuel used?  Would we sell all the fuel retained (hedge it as high as possible) and manage our fuel expense separately through its own purchasing and hedging (as low as possible) effort?  Could we have hedged some portion of our fuel usage last year for this year at $2.36 (like we hedged our excess fuel) and not be subject to the high prices we're seeing this summer? Do you think there is an opportunity here to manage our fuel expense more effectively? Susan, I think you had looked at TW's ability to buy/sell gas a few months back (when we were looking at fuel monetization).  What did the FERC Order say about under what circumstances TW could buy/sell gas?

Hi Misty!  How's everything?  Are we on for this weekend?  Let me know. Since I have plans to see Lyle Lovett on Fri. night, I was thinking of flying in rather than driving Sat. a.m. to save on time & energy, especially since you live so close to the airport! Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S. Open weekend before last...drank a lot of beer also.  Am amazed it turned out as well as it did. You said you work with someone named Hamlet, right?  Apparently he used to live across the street from Karin and Jim, on Evans!  I didn't think there could possibly be 2 Hamlets.  Small world. w/b 
Just so you know, I spoke with the group this morning about contracting practices and they agreed to do the Christine/Susan/dealmaker huddle prior to sending any contracts out.  It helps that I have Kevin's support on this.  I think it will work fine. TK is going make sure Tenaska gets credited.  The difference between actual and billed amounts is very little. 
Steve Stojic called to let me know that the technical conference in RP01-56 
Please see the attached and let me know if you have questions.  If it looks OK to you and the 1/2 reimbursement arrangement is OK with EPFS, please forward to James Centilli for his review.  Thanks. 
Ashley, all that is fine, and I certainly understand, though I would very much hate to lose you because you are a fabulous renter.  Keep your freedom! Stay in my apartment!!  If you do not want to renew for 6 months and want to go month to month after Nov., that is fine.  All I ask is 30 days notice before you move out.  In any event, I'll probably get the floors done just because I think it would be a good improvement to make regardless...I'll check with you before I get the work done to make sure the timing is OK with you. ""Ashley Streetman"" <A2STREET@hewitt.com> on 09/14/2000 10:33:04 AM 
Susan, Before you spend too much making improvements (though the oven does need to be fixed!) Right now, it looks like Deron is not going to be moving in with me as he has some concerns about the wiring for all of his computer gadgets. I love my (your!) garage apartment and really do not want to give it up, however I am not sure if it makes sense for us to keep paying 2 rents, so I am not 100% sure whether I will be renewing my lease after November.  If I did, it would probably be for another six months (ie, I would delay moving in together, which I am considering as there is no real reason to rush). If I do not, I would be happy to post an ad for it here at Hewitt as I have nothing but nice things to say about it and you!  Plus, one would be very hard-pressed to find an irresponsible person here- there are lots of wonderful people here.   I will try to make a decision by the end of Sept. as to give you notice and enough time to try to help you find a nice tenant! I am sorry to seem to fickle-  life is suddenly getting very complicated! ashley 
Ashley, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.  If you have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty old.  I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have temperatures marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that too!  The handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen and bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood around the A/C in the second bedroom.  If there's anything else you've noticed that needs fixing let me know.

Hi Mum!  What an eventful few days it has been.  Sorry I didn't call over the weekend.  I had my hands full painting my bedroom!  It took forever!  Luckily I got the color right on the first try:  the Happy Yellow looks pretty good. Saturday I hauled my paint-covered self to the Met for a pro-am tennis tournament, which was fun.  It was a benefit for DiverseWorks, the theater/art group I've been interested in joining.  In fact, yesterday I got a call from their executive director asking if I was still interested in board membership, and that they would be voting on me tonight!  I'm really excited and am expecting good news.  This could be an auspicious start to life after law for me! Sure enjoyed my visit to Austin.  It went by too quickly!  I hope you're having a good week; let me hear from you! Love, 
Thanks Robert, this is a big help. Just wondering -- you make the statement that ""El Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities...""  Do you think that our having an interconnect agreement outlining the specifications for the facilities and setting forth certain indemnities weaken our position at all in terms of saying this is not a CIAC? Robert Guthrie 09/13/2000 08:05 AM 
I can only address this from the tax position.  Books may differ from the noted treatment depending on the true facts.  I have a call to James Centilli for his thoughts.  I also have not reviewed any written language, so this is based on our conversations; therefore the facts may change depending on the final arrangement. Based on my understanding, the meter fee will be structured as a fee paid to TW for services and not to build the interconnect facilities.  Because El Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities TW will not record these fees as a CIAC for tax.  In short, the management fee is just normal operational type revenue.  The benefit to El Paso is that they avoid the gross-up because this payment does not fall under the guidelines of IRS Code Section 118 (b).  However, please note that the management fee is still taxable to TW in the year actually received or deemed received.   It is just not classified as a CIAC for tax purposes. The potential book benefit to TW is that the interconnect facilities built should be allowed as part of rate base because the assets were built by TW and not contributed from El Paso -- I have a call to James Centilli to confirm. Clarification on CIAC ( IRC 118(b)).  This is a code section that governs for tax only how payments received from customers or potential customers for services that benefit the customer are treated for tax purposes.  For tax, the money received is recognized in the year received or deemed received, and the asset is depreciated, normally 15 years, MACRS.  The Gross-up paid is the time value of money over the life of the asset and is paid by the customer requesting the service. The Management fee structure will generate the same result as the CIAC for tax.  For tax, the money is received and taxed.  The money is then used indirectly to build the interconnect facilities that are deprecated over 15 years, MACRS for tax.  The piece missing is that El Paso avoids the gross-up of approximately $50,000.  The $50,000 becomes a lost cost to TW for doing the deal with El Paso.  The lost cost should be off-set in part from rate recovery.  I don't know how this piece will work -- James Centilli should be able to confirm. Let me know if we need to discuss further.  I am out of the office after 12:30 today to return on Monday.  I will check my voice mail.  However, If you need to move on this or need additional help,  please call me on my mobile number (832) 647-4610. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Robert, here is the beginning of a note I need to send to Drew Fossum explaining what we're doing with El Paso.  Can you elaborate on the ""meter fee"" approach? I'm not sure I really understand what keeps it from being a CIAC, and why we get to include it in the rate base. If you can add to this I would appreciate it, or just give me a call and we can discuss it further.  Thanks so much for your help. *** El Paso Field Services wants TW to build interconnect facilities.  Estimated cost:  $280,000.  EPFS will contribute $165,000 pursuant to an interconnect agreement.  The Commercial Group would like to avoid the tax gross-up associated with a contribution in aid of construction.  The Internal Revenue Code expressly provides that contributions in aid of construction and other contributions made by a customer or potential customer (collectively, ""CIACs"") are not contributions to capital and thus are not excluded from gross income.  Accordingly, such amounts are required to be included in gross income. EPFS has proposed, instead of the $165,000 being paid in a lump sum, that the 
I've discussed the ""actual fuel"" provision with Christine and Bob and made them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets. According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff. I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.  Let me know what you think. 
TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY CONTRACT APPROVAL FORM Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Duke Energy Trading & Marketing (DUKE) and the associated letter from Transwestern to Duke which outlines the conditions of Transwestern's Contribution in Aid of Construction (CIAC) payment to Duke for certain facility upgrades. Transwestern shall pay Duke $750,000 for Duke facility upgrades in order to increase gas receipts into Transwestern from Duke's Artesia plant and Big Eddy gathering system by an incremental 20,000 Dth/d.  Duke shall subsequently subscribe to a five year transportation contract for 20,000 Dth/d of East of Thoreau  (EOT) capacity at a $.05/Dth/d one-part rate effective November 1, 2000.  Duke shall be charged ACTUAL fuel, currently calculated as 1.5% (compared to EOT Tariff fuel rate of 1.31%), for any transportation within Transwestern's EOT Area.  Duke has also been granted the ability to flow to California on an alternate basis at a total rate of $.09/Dth/d plus applicable Tariff fuel (currently 5%).

Hi DeShonda, I had emailed a week or two ago in regards to the new parking and haven't heard anything back yet.  Could you drop me a line at your earliest convenience and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space. Thanks, Susan M. Scott X31455 Parking & Transportation@ENRON 03/28/2001 04:07 PM 
The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon. Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

nope...dinner...bed 
No LW's for me tonight either...have dinner plans with a friend and ditto tomorrow night.  Friday may a happy hour option though. Sue This is seriously stooping for me but my car's in the shop and I can't track down my roommate or anyone else that lives in close proximity to me... so, (now here's the stooping part) do you know what time your neighbor is heading home?

Caycie, I just left a message for you at work...How EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe both you and Jen got engaged on the same weekend.  I'm absolutely thrilled for you and look forward to all the fun festivities this will warrant.  You know I think Briggs is great (I've had so much fun hanging out with him at all of these weddings) and you're obviously pretty fond of him so I can't imagine a better bit of news than that of your engagement.  I can't wait to hear all about the event (and see the ring - I'm sure it's gorgeous). I think I'm actually going to try and come up to Austin the weekend of the 12th...from what I understand Jessica will still be in town, as will Corey, and Jen had expressed some interest in making a road trip so we'll see. Love, Sue PS - Are you coming in for Deborah's wedding? 
Susan- I hope that all is well.  you might have already heard by now, but Briggs and I are ENGAGED!!!!  It happened Friday!  I didn't know how to reach you so I would your e-mail on one of Lisa's e-mails.  I hope that all is well. Let me know when you will be in Austin next. Talk to you soon!

Just heard from the Earl...he said he's okay but has just been really busy the last few weeks.  I encourage you to drop him another line sometime in the near future and suggest lunch, as he seems receptive to interaction at this point. As for last Wednesday, we had actually moved on to Steak Night by 9:30 and then were off to Sierra's.  Needless to say it was a big night. Glad to hear the game was good and I'm not suprised in the least that you have ""get-up-and-go"" (I've seen you when an attractive woman passes by). I'm a no go for Thursday as I've actually already made dinner plans with a friend.  Besides, Dean's is the ex's favorite Thursday night hang-out for the reason you mentioned and for that same reason it sadly is not mine.  I'm sure after this response Ben will be convinced I'm avoiding him, but I assure you that is not the case. Cheers I should be in town this weekend if anything is going on... 
Oh I am so glad to hear from you! How are things? Been thinking about you---no not in that way. :) No, actually, Daniel and I got back around 9:30 and I went into Farrago's to see if you were there....but you weren't. I looked like death warmed over after the game...it has been way too long since my playing days. To be true, I have the get-up-and-go, but I literally whiffed a few kicks... Thankfully, Daniel played well. He had one pitch that was sweet!! What are you up to this week? I am trying to get Ben to go with me to Dean's on Thursday. I love that place on Thursdays....wait, I digress...I like the ladies on Thursdays there. Want to go? Let me know what the Earl says...I am a little disappointed in him as of late...not that he cares..... Walle (that's Latin for ""good day"") Susan M Scott@ECT 04/25/2001 03:31 PM 
What happened to you last Wednesday?  Were you too pooped after you soccer game for a cold brew?  Hope you had a good weekend anyway and that things are in general are going well. I just dropped the Earl a line to see if he's still breathing.  I'll let you know if I hear anything back. Caio

Christine, I made a few changes for purposes of clarification. Christine Stokes 09/12/2000 09:45 AM 
Here it is. 
that's okay...i'm used to it at this point 
I was walking with the trader I work for when you called, so it was obviously a little difficult for me to discuss Vegas at the time.  If you get a hankering to talk in the morning you can try me on my cell phone ( midnight - 2 am isn't too late for me, which I think is between 6-8 am your time, right?).  I know this is obnoxious, but I can't talk to Lisa about this and I need a co-conspirator. 
I will definitely think about it...I would just feel bad though missing the event since I talked to Barrett (Deborah's fiancee) all about the big day at Lisa and Brad's wedding.  What may be an option is me taking part or all of Monday off and just heading to Austin Sunday and coming back Monday...I'll talk to my trader about the possibility. 
I think you can skip Deborah's wedding.  Your good excuse is that I have to work the next weekend.  Starting on Thursday (the 10th), I have to do Law Review stuff until the issue we are working on is finished.  It could be two weeks-- it could be right up until I have to start work...  I don't really know.  Of course, I won't be working all day everyday, so we could do dinner, a movie, etc. that weekend. I don't want to encourage you not to go to Deborah's wedding, but, frankly, I am all weddinged out.  Have you made plans to go with anyone?  Maybe something could mysteriously come up... Oh well-- it's up to you-- you could decide next Saturday if you want to... -Corey

I've got Deborah Vest's wedding next weekend so that's a no go, but I was thinking about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe that will work.  I would actually love to skip out on the wedding...however, since the wedding's in Houston and I live here, I don't have a very good excuse do I? And don't worry...we could wait two years and I'd still want to chat about Vegas.  One of those things you'll never really forget.  I'm sure I sounded funny and I was definitely tired, but in now way were either of these bad things. Sue 
Here is my suggestion-- Let's push everything back one week.  My finals are finished Saturday morning (the 5th), and we could go to Barton Springs immediately afterward, and eat dinner, and rent a movie, and shop on Sunday, etc. I am really so behind on my school work that I can't justify taking time off this weekend.  I would try my hardest, but I just don't think I would be very much fun. However, I would love to talk about Vegas.  I've been wondering about it because I thought you sounded funny.  Maybe you were just tired. Let me know. -Corey 
Hey girls...I hate this, but I may be out Thursday.  Please still let me know where you guys are going to be and if anything changes I'll meet you there.  Otherwise, have a great time and to both Lisa and Jen, I need to see you guys and hear all about the honeymoon and the proposal           ( both are very good things and I love good things ). Sue 
I think Aries is the one- event though it is $$$. Since Ashlea went to Fox Diner last week and only said good as a comment, then I say we go for it and try Aries.  7pm on Thursday it is if everyone else agrees.

Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion: I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece). The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday. Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend. Sue

Congrats!....Lisa told me the good news last night.  Can't wait for the big= day, I know you guys will be very happy together. =20 
Hi Guys- I just wanted to let you all know that Jaron finally popped the question!  Of course, I said yes and we are just so excited!  We will be very busy these next few months, but wanted to let everyone know that the date will be August 11.  I know it seems soon, but we have been doing a little planning and are ready to start our new lives together. So, if possible-save the date!  We would love to have you join us.  Take care and talk to you soon!! Laura 
I had some appetizers the other day at the MFA that were provided by Aries and they were very good.  Definitely wouldn't mind trying that place. 
I want to try those as well as one that Lisa just reminded me of... Aries on Montrose near Black Lab.... can't wait to see everyone! :o) 
I think that ultimately I would feel OK about giving them #1 and #2 under the circumstances, if these guys are really that concerned about these issues.  I really don't think TW is ever going to breach its confidentiality obligations.  I need to get Drew's clearance for Colorado law; I'll get back to you. Gerald Nemec@ECT 09/11/2000 07:17 PM 
Susan,  Tri-States comments.  I plan to give them Colorado law but to discuss the other two with them.  Let me know your thoughts. 
Gerald: Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows: 1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well. 2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential, punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we should have three years to commence an action after termination. 3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is familiar with. Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is reasonable and appropriate. Thanks, Dave Nocera 
Either option sounds good to me.  Just send an email with the time and place when you guys figure it out and I'll be there. 
Jen and I were consulting on the issue at hand and we came up with a couple of ideas for where to go...either Amazon Grill by the galleria or Fox Diner on Shepherd?  Email me with your pick or any other suggestions.  See y'all Thursday!

Vegas trip was pretty interesting.  Give me a call tonight if you get a chance.  Try the cell phone any time after 4:30 (Houston time) - (713) 775-6472. 
Try hard... 
I'm going ot try and be there! 
Vegas baby!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't wait...our flight arrives around 6:00 and then we head back Sunday morning.  It's a ""work"" trip. Will do on pitching the 12th to the gang. Sue 
Hey there, Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the frustration may be for naught.  As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.  I think I have a wedding in Houston that weekend anyway.  I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get together.  I've been needing a good Austin fix.  The trip to San Diego was awesome.  We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh yeah, and watch the sun set).  I did find time to go to a spa and get a bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.  I'm off again this weekend so I have to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh! Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you tonight. Sue 
I can't respond to my Hotmail account on this machine.  So... Bummer...I will be out of town the weekend of the 28th (Jazz Fest) and will be out Friday on the weekend of the 5th.  I will be flying back that Saturday and will be going to a wedding with most of those guys.  Do you want me to find out if a certain one needs a date?  Hmmmm...  It's his boss, so I don't know how that would fly, but I'll find out. However, I think that I would really like to be in Austin one of the next two weekends (5/12 & 5/19) and my plans should not in any way limit yours. Caycie and Jessica (thru 5/14) will be here and Jen pops over all the time. And, I know that your sis would love to see you!!  Of course, I would hate to miss you, but since you are in the jet-set I know that your schedule is really busy.  How was San Diego?  Or, is that this weekend? -MR 
I'll see you guys there. 
lisa and i are planning on going to the ale house between 5:45 and 6 tonight. does that time sound good for you? susan, i don't know if this is when you get off work, so let me know if this time is bad for you! see you there! ashlea

How about tomorrow? I have the new pro forma OBA in Word format, by the way.  Should make getting a draft out easier.  Here it is if you want to take a look. Lorraine Lindberg 09/11/2000 04:53 PM 
Hey gals - Could we get together for about 30 minutes this week to put together an OBA for Southwest Gas?  I've asked Larry Black (SWG) to review the draft which we filed in our 637 compliance filing and we need to address a couple of issues specific to SWG.  Then, we'll have to go to Las Vegas to wrap up all the details, of course. How about discussing this over lunch anytime this week?  Let me know.  Thanks. Lorraine 
Next week sounds good to me too.  If everyone wants to meet at Ale house for a drink today why don't we try right after work.  Susan had a very big night last night and needs to be in bed early tonight as a result. 
I guess there's some sort of fine for dating...sounds like a load of BS to me.  What's your AOL messenger name? 
why does that mean? does it not cost him money to date outside of the company? Susan M Scott 04/19/2001 09:39 AM 
definitely ted actions...served no purpose, just made me feel rotten and reiterated what an ass he is/was.  He actually said he can't inter-company date b/c is costs him money if he does ($60 a date).  I told him it was a good thing he got so much in when he could.

Are you going to be in Austin next weekend (the 28th)?  I'm thinking about making a trip up there to visit.  Let me know. 
Lillian, I forgot to add that the slate of directors and officers for Capacity Management Corp. will be identical to that of Transwestern Pipeline 
Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call. ?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract?    YES. ?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES. ? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights. ? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's ""negotiated"". Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.  We are not 100% 
I think it's probably a good idea not to contact Eric for a while.  Truly what purpose would it serve?  As for my work situations, they aren't that exciting but have made for some highly uncomfortable moments for me.  I'll tell you about them on my next visit.  See, I've already come up with a reason why I have to come back out there.  Please don't worry about flapping Sat night.  I certainly do not think less of you and completely agree about the life lessons part.  To tell the truth, I worry at times that I'm not learning enough of the life lessons...just kind of staying in a very safe, secure place and missing out on a big part of the overall picture.  Enough self-analysis.  Have a good evening....you should his jazz night at Epizote just for me. Sue 
how fun- i totally forgot that you're off to vegas this weekend!  thanks for the input about clint- you're right, and i hadn't realized that i fit his ""type"" until he defined it.   now i know why he's so nice to me!  he does know about brendan, of course, but since i don't always behave like i have a boyfriend it's easy for guys to not take him too seriously.....not good.  i'm also embarrassed that i flapped away in the car on saturday night- hope you don't think horrible things about me.  although it's okay if you do- i think horrible things about myself every now and then! but i always attribute it to the lessons of life.....i'm curious about your work situations- you've never mentioned them.  that is truly uncomfortable and i have not had to deal with that here..... keep me posted on your exciting life!  otherwise, i'm doing the right thing to not contact eric, right?  so silly for me to ask, but i like being friends with him (probably the flirting is fun), but it's a dead end.....

Hey girls, Just wanted to let you guys know that Southwest has vacation specials to New Mexico right now.  I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Albuquerque (we'd have to drive to Sante Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.  Personally, I think this is a really good price.  I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.  We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen.  Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.  I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday. Talk to you soon, Sue

Christine, the ""actual fuel usage"" provision is probably a material deviation from the tariff, unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated in our tariff.  I have added language to this effect. If we're using the ""actual fuel"" language because we anticipate that the fuel usage will exceed the maximum, and therefore we do not wish to cap the percentage at the maximum, we can certainly leave my additional language out and file a summary of the contract.  I do not think such a filing would generate too much unwanted attention from FERC or our shippers.  Let me know. Christine Stokes 09/07/2000 09:36 AM 
Let me know if you have any revisions to the provided discount letter. Note that this contract will only charge ACTUAL FUEL utilized if the Shipper transports along the primary path (Paragraph 2).  Also, Kevin - is $.09 a sufficient TOTAL RATE for alternate deliveries to the California Border?  I think by fixing the rate like this we are leaving a lot of money behind.  We could put wording in the contact that each month the alternate rate to California will be set by Transwestern.  We have, a long time ago, used this language and it forces the shipper to call TK for the appropriate montly rate quote.  If fact, Richardson Products has this arrangement.   Let me know your thoughts. 
Phillip, Here's the power point presentation with updated information.

hope everyone is okay with this -- i talked to the people that were here and we all agreed. 
not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the birthdays simple.

You asked: 1.  For a customer keeping a PNR balance for several days, is it accepta= ble to charge whatever is the posted rate for each of those days, or should= TW charge the rate in effect on the first day of the balance? Answer:  The tariff doesn't say.  I believe this is a business decision.= Would we rather charge the same rate every day, or are both parties OK wi= th taking the risk that it will go up or down from day to day?  My understa= nding is that we presently charge the same rate that was in effect on the s= ame day.  I also understand that, rather than documenting the rate in a con= tract or other writing, we rely on our posting.  If we change our practice = and start charging the posted rate applicable to each rate, I recommend at = a minimum that we notify our customers in a posting.  From a legal standpoi= nt I also have to recommend that the rate be documented in a deal sheet, e-= mail or other writing.  While we may be indifferent (after all, Form M says= the max rate applies in absence of an agreement to the contrary), document= ation of the actual rate could save us hassle if a conflict arises. Another thing:  There is nothing to keep us from charging some shippers = the posted rate on the first day for the entire term of the balance, and ot= her shippers the posted rate from day to day.  However, there can be no dis= crepancy among similarly situated shippers.  To avoid the appearance of dis= crimination, I'd recommend choosing one method or the other, if that is fea= sible from a business standpoint. =20 Assuming you are going to use the day to day approach for all shippers, = here are my recommendations: My recommended language to include on the rate posting webpage would be = something to this effect:  BALANCES CARRIED FORWARD FROM DAY TO DAY SHALL B= E CHARGED THE RATES APPLICABLE TO EACH DAY OF THE BALANCE.  (If this looks = awkward to you let's discuss a better way to say it.) I recognize PNR deals happen within minutes.  However, if it is possible= to do an e-mail or fax, it could read:  The rate applicable to Contract No= . ______ on each day that quantities are parked or ridden shall be the rate= posted on Transwestern's website for that day.  Another option might be ju= st to include this language as an attachment to the master agreement; it wo= uld not have to be done for each deal. 2.  If we have the following situation:  Shipper A has parked 10,000 dth fo= r a week and wants to move it out; Shipper B wants to ride 10,000 dth; we c= an only accommodate schedule activity totaling 10,000 dth -- who gets prior= ity? Answer:  Shipper A should have priority because it has the greatest tota= l cost commitment to TW in accordance with Sheet 37E of the tariff. 
I bolt out of here pretty early these days if I can...best to reach me by cell phone if it's past 4 pm Houston time (713-775-6472).  Did I tell you I'm off to Vegas this weekend?  I love this job. Sue 
you are utterly unreachable.  have tried to call 3 times and am stopped in my tracks by some secretary type who takes 5 mins to tell me you are not at your desk.  what up?  try to call me later tonight- have ""appointment"" with jen at 9 pm my time, so preferably before 9 or after 10 pm....peace out. e _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com 
Hey Lisa, Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all. Thanks, 
So...the weekend I was talking about coming to Austin the following people are playing: Fri	The Fabulous Thunderbirds	Gruene Hall Fri	Cory Morrow			Luckenbach Dance Hall Sat	Reckless Kelly			Antone's Sat	Lucinda Williams		Gruene Hall Just more food for thought. Sue 
Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.  It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.  Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.  Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them. Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.  I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future. I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.  Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.  I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet. Talk to you soon, Sue 
I liked that-- and I deinitely agree!  I have done about half of those things...  Not too bad for a spoiled brat. Are you leaving for San Diego tomorrow?  I am coming in town tomorrow, but I bet I am going to miss you. -Corey > > _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com 
Yes, I'm back from SD and appropriately depressed to return to hot, muggy Houston.  Glad to hear your trip was so enjoyable...and no worries about the pina colodas, you gotta do what you gotta do ( I was drinking rum punches in the Caymans like they were water...much scarier than pina colodas I assure you).  The weather, scenery and people in SD were gorgeous.  I really think I'm supposed to be in Del Mar.  There are the most attractive, active, worldly men swarming the beaches with even cuter dogs.  I spent a large part of the weekend with my tongue hanging out.  It forced me to the realization that the men in Houston, and much of Texas, are soft.  Alas, no exciting stories though... Let me know how the movie is, I may have to make a special trip to see this one...All of the Kappas who've read the book insist I should write my own version filled with Susan's tails of woe.  There is definitely ample material. Sorry to hear about Ben and the girlfriend.  I'm sure your parents will be sad to see his calming influence go. Talk to you soon, Sue 
hey- guess you're bk from SD- hope it was fun.  am guessing the weather was fab, and you had a chance to eat drink and be merry. the cananries were grt- 75 degrees, breezy and not a cloud in the sky.  was reading the avg rainfal per yr is approx 13 days, so i guess the odds were in our favor.  poured my lumpy white body into a bikini, much to the dismay of anyone on the beach with healthy vision, and drank dos equis, pina coladas (am not proud, but they WERE good!)  and copious amts of pringles and bags of mini snickers and kit kats.  heaven on earth.  back to reality today- sigh.  no class til next mon, but major grp assignment due then, so will be working on that all week. today:  research and seeing bridget jones diary in afternoon (bank holiday here).  pretty lame easter.  church by myself- avg age in congregation:104, approx 20 people.  london completely empies out for easter since mon and fri are bank holidays. kind of their spring brk.  called the fam at gogo's to say happy easter.  not pretty.  all the grandchildren were absent for the first time this yr- jeremy and new wife in austin, cousin christi and hubby in dallas, ben at home ""suicidal""  according to mom b/c megan dumped him. which is REEEALLY bad news- in fact, he came bk from her house post break up w/ a broken ankle or something...mom thinks from a fight he may have got into w/ a guy at megan's.....oh, the drama of it all.  either way, am pissed b/c he left my poor father to lift and carry and ""transport"" my VERY heavy deadweight Pa Pa bk and forth from the nursing home by himself, and my GoGo and nans and gramps were almost paralyzed w/ grief b/c thee was not ONE youngster there.  little creep.  well, am off to the library-  try to chat tonight- e _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com

Actually...I the first available appointment on Sat is 2:00 pm (right in the thick of beach time!!).  I ended up making my reservation yesterday for 11:00 am tomorrow, I might be able to switch it to 10:00 though b/c they still had it open yesterday.  However, the 11:00 may work out perfectly.    That way when my treatment's done at 12:30 we could just start our day from there - lunch, shopping, etc.  What do you think?  I'm sure I can find some way to occupy myself for a couple of hours on Sat...no worries. 
hey susan- any chance you could get into the spa around 10:00 on saturday?  i'm sure that's a popular time, just wanted to see if that was a slot they'd had available....my study group wants to meet at 10 on saturday, and i'm planning to go for just 2 hours, so it would work great if you could do the spa thing then.  if not, then the beach is right across the street from the library where we'll be meeting so i could always join you there after my study session.....it's sprinkling right now but is supposed to clear up tomorrow and be sunny this weekend ( i hope!!). i cannot wait to have a weekend to relax- it has been so crazy here! i'll see you tonight!!worst case scenario (contingent upon weather and traffic) i'll pick you up at continental curbside baggage claim.....travel safely! julie 
Thanks Sarah.  That was very touching.  I just forwarded it to a bunch of people...too good not to share.  Hope you have a happy Easter!!! Love, 
I couldn't agree more...Happy Holidays! Sue Paul Harvey writes: We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse. For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I really would. I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated. I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car. And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in, I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him. When you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'll let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head. I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like. May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn you hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole. I don't care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend. I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays. I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. These things I wish for you through tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, its the only way to appreciate life. Send this to all of your friends who mean the most to you.

Ships passing in the night....I'm glad you get to see the fam this weekend.  Be sure to tell everyone I say, ""Hello!""  As for the zoo, I am a huge fan.  It's the only zoo I've ever been to that I don't feel sorry for the animals.  It's too bad things weren't better co-ordinated but I think my weekend's going to be pretty full regardless.  Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon. Sue Em's in the Canary Islands this week...can you believe that little brat? 
I promise I'm not trying to rub it in....actually, I was just going to do the spa thing to give you study time but if you don't need it (and you'd rather go shopping, etc.) let me know and I will forget about it.  I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful. Sue 
hey susan- you are so demanding with your spa schedule!  : )  are you rubbing it in, or what??   friday sounds better, because saturday we have  bunch of tentative plans....i'm also not as stressed about the studying factor because i took monday as a vacation day to study, but please do go ahead- the spa treatment sounds wonderful!  so anytime friday works great for me.... julie At 01:33 PM 4/11/2001 -0500, you wrote: Hey Julie, Just wondering if you had any preferences regarding the spa times I emailed you yesterday.

Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a summary of the comments. Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA could purchase an ""out of the money"" call option essentially cost free, since its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds from ENA's ability to then ""move the market"" through the establishment of the long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage. TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that applies to all interstate pipelines. Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff. Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate. Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require TW to do so in a final order. Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.

Hey Kasey, I just got an email back from KJ and he seemed to think you're going to be in San Diego until Saturday or Sunday of this week...so, I thought I'd drop you a line and let you know I too will be in San Diego.  I arrive Thursday evening and don't leave again until Sunday afternoon.  If you have any free time give me a call on my cell phone, 713-775-6472, and we can try to get together.  I've got your number from your last visit to Houston so don't be suprised if you hear from me. Talk to you soon, 
Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one) Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment. Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow. Time: 90 minutes Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment. Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin. Time: 90 minutes Ta Ta, 
I'm checking out the L'Auberge website as we speak...it sounds wonderful.  = As for baseball, I'd love to stop by for a few innings on Saturday.

Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could use your help on that part of the discussion. *** Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.

Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right? I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there? Susan Maybe I'll hit an ""Eaters"" outing. 
Thanks for the info...I will check into it.  Hope you manage to get some rest.  The wedding was fun, super sweet and huge (800+ at the reception).  I got hit on by a waiter at the rehearsal dinner and groped in the hotel elevator by one of the groomsmen...so I'm up on guys right now. Talk to you soon, Sue 
just got this response.  have not read it, but after what has felt like the longest day of my life, am not sure i can still read.  go ahead and analyze and act as necessary.  will chat when i come bk out of coma.  goodnite. e

Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought. 
no, i don't really.....do you have ideas??  we have a couple options:  there is an easter service in some flower fields that are just beautiful and have an ocean view- if it's nice, it might be a unique place to go for a service.  otherwise, there's always my parent's church, but that's rather far so i've already set them up for us not joining them.  there is another church in my area which a bunch of friends go to, but to which i've never been.....i'll send out the email and find out where everyone is going this weekend.....let me know if you've heard of good brunch places!

I just thought maybe you had a regular spot.  Let me know. 
I'm flying Continental and I will check my mailbox for the card...I haven't checked it in a while.  I'm going to bring my pictures from the last two weekends ( very fun activities...I tell you all about them this weekend). Love ya, Susan 
great- sounds perfect!  have you seen any movies lately?  i haven't seen a movie in forever and there are several girl movies out that i would love to see....chocolat among them.- i've heard the scenery is amazing.  what airline are you flying?  i'll be there thursday at 7, and will check the arrival time before leaving work.  i will be picking you up directly from work, but always have my cell phone on me, should you need to get in touch:  619-890-7565. yeah!!! thursday will be here before we know it!! have a great week.....oh- i have several rainy day activities, should the weather be less than stellar. did you ever get the card i mailed you at work? can't wait to see you! love, julie At 10:49 AM 4/9/2001 -0500, you wrote: Hi yourself, I swear you read my mind sometimes...I was just about to email you.

hi susan- how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a note before it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a day off- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed (horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, so i may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get it all done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude on our beach time! the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming it will warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitely bring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter..... what are your flight times? can't wait to see you! love, julie 
Hi Ashley, It's so funny that you emailed me today because I was just telling Jessica this weekend that I needed to drop you a line.  Unfortunately, I'm no longer moving to London.  I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.  However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.  I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live. Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.  I will be in town basically the 6th through the 11th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).  I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.  Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies... I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together. Talk to you soon, Susan 
Susan, I know this is a bit random, but I know that you had maybe mentioned coming over to London for a year.  I have no idea if this will pan out, but I am looking for a roommate.  If you were comign over and might want to be my roommate, I would be super excited.  I live in a really cool area in teh middle of everything and do not want to have to give up the flat.  It is actually really cheap rent at ?200 a week or so.  the little man who owns it lives next door and keeps different flowers planted depending on the season. If you are not coming, or just do not want to be my roommate, do  you think you could keep your ears open for anyone you know who might be moving over. Do you think your friend who you were visiting might need a roommate? Think on it and let me know any feedback. Take care, Ashley

Hey buddy, Out of curiosity, what all are you bringing with you to San Antonio?  I'm running into some problems in the area of cocktail dresses as I developed some noticeable tan lines from my trip.  Oh well, I guess they're not that big a deal right? Also, do you just want to swing by my complex Friday morning to pick me up?  I promise not to run too late. Talk to you soon, 
We know about Merle...don't know if I'll be able to go though b/c I have to be in San Antonio at a bridal luncheon by 12:30 on Friday.  There's no reserved seating anyway so I think I might be a bit of a mess (remember how crowded the Bellamy Brothers were?) As for the trip over...I'm arriving on the 6th ( Wednesday morning at 7:45) and I'll be leaving the morning of the 12th.  Not perfect, but if something looks appealing on the mid-week trip front let me know.  I'll have a total of 6 full days over there.  Plenty of time to do something interesting right? Sue I'm not going to tell Lisa for a little while, so mum's the word....hopefully she'll already have booked her own flight. 
did you girls know merle haggard was going to be at tine hall on thurs. the 5th?! can't believe it!  hope y'all are planning on going.... e _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com 
Sunil, I promise I have not forgotten about you.  Things around here have just been crazy with the beginning of the month and all.  I should have some time tomorrow to get together if you like, just give me a call. Talk to you soon, 
Hey stranger, Haven't talked to you in while, how are things going?  The trip was absolutely incredible.  We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish. Anyway, I've decided I'm a no go for Austin this Thursday night.  I'm already exhausted and Jen Bowles offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.  After the Caymans last weekend, Lisa's wedding this weekend and San Diego next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.  Regardless, I will see you and Doug Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.  My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and Doug. Talk to you soon, Susan 
Actually, I'm thrilled you want to drive.  I know I like to drive most of the time, but I'm not kidding about being exhausted and thus wanting to limit my exertion.  I think we should shoot for leaving by 8:00 so that if we're running a few minutes late it's no big deal (as long as we're on the road by 8:30 we should be fine).  I have no idea what I'm wearing yet either...oh well, necessity is the mother of invention, right? The trip was incredible.  My life has done an absolute about face.  Can't wait to tell you all about it. Talk to you later, Susan 
Yeah!!!  If you don't mind, I would love to drive... Matt is flying in and I'm not sure if he'll need a car but I wanted to have mine available to him if he did need it.... is that alright? THANK YOU... BIG for making maps... that will be wonderful! The luncheon is at 12:30 and how long does it take to get to S.A.?  Should we leave by 8:00 or 8:30????  I don't even know what I'm wearing yet..... ughhhh! I can't wait to hear about your trip... how was it? Talk to you soon friend! Love, Jen 
Lexi, I would like to volunteer for the Information Session on September 17.  My apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting, but from the beginning of October through last Friday I couldn't take a single day off from work.  Fortunately, I'm in a new rotation and they have a bit more flexibility when it comes to my schedule. Thanks, Susan 
Okay,  I'm in for driving together on Friday.  Although I'd love to see my sister and her family in Austin, I decided last night that I'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be.  So...we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on Friday morning and who wants to drive.  I'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so I cut down on my frustration level in regards to San Antonio.  Absolutely no more getting lost for Susan...zapps my energy. Talk to you later, 
Yes, I am going home before the reception and am going to have Katy meet me at the apartment around 6:15 (at least that's what time I'm telling her).  If you want to tell Laura to meet at the apartment around that time too, I will be there to greet her.  I'm going to drop off some dry cleaning, finish my laundry and clean up a bit before they get there.  I'm so glad everyone is up for this outing...we are so culturally aware. So that's the plan.  I suggest we eat somewhere around the Museum District...I'll do some research this afternoon. Talk to you later, Sue 
Here you go....Katy wrote me an email and said she'd prefer to eat afterwards ( as would I ), so I say we plan to get to the ""reception"" around 7:00 and leave for dinner roughly 8:30.  Let me know if that works for you. 
Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for 
When you get a chance, tell me again what your schedule is for the end of April through July.  I'm trying to figure when I can come visit and not pay too much on airfare, be able to stay a decent amount of time and not miss critical days at work. I will definitely come over...just don't know if it'll will be when Katy does. 
Just got the email myself...will definitely check it out. 
Theresa and Nicole, Jay and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the Denver desk and Fed-Ex them to the Houston office.  Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.  As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we  understand all of the available options these contracts allow us. Below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet: -36169000 -36177000 -33084000 -33085000 -33038000 -31029000 -33171000 -33175000 -116388 -903145 -IT-601 -41066000 -41075000 If there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well. Thanks for all the help, Susan 
Did you just add another ticket under my name or did you request three additional tickets?  As for dinner, I just emailed Katy and asked for her preference.  I think it'd be more pleasant/less hurried if we went afterwards...say 8:30ish, but before would work for me too.  I haven't talked to my Mom yet about the tickets, but I'll give her a call when things calm down a bit here. Talk to you later, Sue 
Sue, I called and we are set for tomorrow night.  Are we going to try to dinner before, after or middle depending on how exciting it it? Were you able to find out the specifics on the airline tickets?  Transferring the tickets to my name, etc? Just curious.  We can talk about it tonight. 
Earl, Long time...no nothing.  How goes it?  Just wanted to drop you a line and see how the fam's doing.  Hope all is well.  We really need to grab a drink after work sometime or a late afternoon coffee and catch-up on each other's respective endeavours. Talk to you soon, 
Hey, Just wanted to make sure you're still up for the MFA reception tomorrow night.  I told Lisa about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well.  So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).  Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.  I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details. See ya, 
Hey, Very jealous about the Canary Island trip...that sounds wonderful.  Take my advice though...use sunscreen!  I was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and I've paid the price.  Kind of looks like I was scolded with boiling water. So I've got Lisa's wedding this weekend and my San Diego trip the next.  I'm taking Friday off this week so I can go to the Bridesmaid/House Party luncheon in San Antonio and we've got Good Friday off from work the next week so I'm looking at two four-day work weeks.  My how things have changed. I think Katy and I are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the MFA tomorrow night and Lisa has expressed interest in going as well, but we'll see about that.  She's always enthusiastic in the beginning.  All in all things are pretty good. Talk to you soon, Sue 
well. glad you're bk from paradise and filled up on fruity drnks.  just got bk from day of grp project  hell, and now my damn portable phone isn't chged, so cannot call- will try to tomorrow. am jazzed- going to the canary islands off the coast of africa for 4 days at easter on super cheap last min trip.  can't wait- could be scary.  my virgin hie skin won't know what to do w/ all that sunshine!  will definitely be coming bk crispy!  glad it was a 'fruitful' trip.... e _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com 
Sunil, I just checked my messages this morning....I didn't think people could leave messages anymore after I was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can.  If you ever want to get a hold of me in the future, the best bets are email and cell phone (713-775-6472). I'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to.  Just let me know a time and place and I'm there. 
Here is the draft for distribution.  In addition to the customer-friendly ""looking forward to meeting with our business partners"" language I know you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following: Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.  We are providing these draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to filing.  The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your company.  Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management approval prior to filing with the Commission. 
I believe this was intended for the Susan Scott with ETS...I'm with Nat Gas= Trading. Thanks 
I'm leaving shortly for the airport, but I will give you a call when I get back so we can discuss transport to SA. I am way too excited about this trip (many pics will be taken). Susan I completely agree about foregoing the Mucky Duck Tuesday...too cold and too rainy for me. 
Oh boy was that ever a thunderstorm last night.... it was GREAT!!!  Good call on not heading out... we will re-schedule for sure :o). I'm excited about your trip to the Caymans... lucky dog! So... about our little venture to S.A.... when are you getting back from your trip?  I am up for driving Friday morning.  If you want to go to Austin Thursday night please feel free... that is fine... I just feel calmer when I don't have to drive at rush hour.  Aaahhh!!! I can't wait to catch up wich choo! Talk to you soon, Jen _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com 
the Cayman Islands We're leaving in about a 1/2 hour for the airport and I am extremely excited about the trip.  I will be sure to take lots of pictures and drink many fruity drinks.  Actually, I'm going scuba diving tomorrow and then we're taking a catamaran on Saturday out to some island (I will be taking full advantage of the sunning net for the trip out to the island).  Additionally, we've got first class dinners booked every night and I should be able to fit in a massage...I know, it's sick. Also, I'm sure you noticed that I emailed Niclas about you so the door has been cracked open...Just a warning though, based on a Tuesday night conversation with Lisa I'm afraid our dear Mitch may be biting the dust soon.  We'll see though, she has become very flighty (okay, is flighty) when it comes to guys. 
Hey Lisa, Once again I am so impressed with your organizational skills when it comes to this wedding.  Just wanted to let you know that I will definitely be attending the luncheon on Friday and may even end up riding to SA with Jen (which always makes the drive that much more enjoyable). As for the ""Manicures and Pedicures for the Girls"", I would like to put my order in for a Turkey Breast sandwich on white.  I can't wait till next weekend, it's going to be so much fun...can you believe it's almost here? Love ya, Susan PS - I've mailed the receipt for your nightie so you should get it by Saturday...sorry it took me so long. 
Girls- Hopefully you got your itinerary in the mail.  Please email me first, if you did not get it and second, what your order is from Zito's.  The menu should be in there. Thanks! It's really coming up!!! Love you! Lisa 
Yup...I leave for the Caymans today.  Our flight out is at 1:45, so we'll probably be leaving the office around 11:45 this morning.  I am, understandably, very excited. We will definitely talk more about Tuesday night either Sunday or Monday.  As for Civil War, I'll keep checking to see what the deal is with the tickets.  The going away party for Kenny should be really fun, I'm glad you're in the states and able to see him off properly. Have a good weekend and I'll be sure to take lots of pictures. See ya next week, Susan 
Hi Susan, I guess you leave tomorrow for your little trip.  I am so jealous.  But if anyone deserves it, it's you!  Anyway, I am excited about next Tuesday.  Should be fun.  We can discuss the details next week.  Have a great trip!!!!!  Talk to you Sunday or Monday. Katy 
Julie, I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal. I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything. Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life. Talk to you soon,

Not sure of the topic of our meeting but here's the Options filing in case you need it. 
I called and left a message requesting two tickets for the reception...I will let you know if we get them.  I'll try and give you a call later today.  I'm not actually leaving until Thursday for the Caymans though, so if you're up for steak night etc. Wednesday night let me know.  It can't be a late night for packing reasons, but I'd like to do something. Susan 
Susan, Sounds good to me!  Let me know if you get the tickets. Call me later!  If I don't talk to you tonight, have a great time in The Caymans!! 
You can take me off this distribution as I am no longer with risk. Thanks, Susan =20 
The below is a list of Friday, March 23 deals in which the Confirm was not = sent to C/P by Mar 26 (T/D + 1). 
I'm just glad I'm going to be out of town for the next 3 weekends.  What pray tell will she do?  With no buffer there, will there be any reason for Mitch not to shack?  I'm curious to see how all of this plays out.  She keeps looking for signs to know whether Mitch is right or not...I told her it's pretty unlikely that anything's going to whack her over the head so she's just going to have to figure out for herself what she thinks of him.  She's got such a tough life. 
she must live under the ""PR mentality"", that being 'any attenion is GOOD attention'.....and of course there's NO regard for the audience.  makes me think of the jon lovitz SNL skit: ""i just want to be loved, is that so

I believe this was intended for Susan Scott with ETS...I'm with Nat Gas trading. Thanks 
I know, I know.  It's still weird to me.  While I thought it was great that Lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on...I'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him, or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her.  I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.  That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.  I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.  Seems more like ""good buddy"" to me.  I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past. On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.  I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much.  I'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with Jen when Craigers was in the picture.  It's not a pleasant memory, trust me.  I do think it's weird that Lisa never wants me to leave their presence...they both questioned me when I took off to bed last night around 9:30...I just wanted out. Sue 
NO!  again, sue- you are giving lisa too much credit- assuming she is capable of a motivation or thought that is BEYOND our comprehension!  the truth is, you DO understand, just don't it to be the truth- it's a dark, scary place to go!  basically, she wants to ""show off""  what she HAS, and yet again, PRAY you will be in full veg mode, looking as pitiful as, say, i do rt now- on my couch, eating gummy bears- thoroughly enjoying my wasted existance- so that she can further convince the oh-so-dimple mitch that he ""picked the RIGHT roomie!""  and i honest to god think she DOES think that way.  or, perhaps, spending quality alone time w/ him would incenuate too much of a relationship, and when she tries to ""capture"" the swiss boy's affection (while cleverly using a visit w/ her good pal em as a justification) she won't feel as bad- i mean, she and mitch WEREN'T that close...at least, SHE wasn't.....no harm, no foul.  whoa.  should i be a therapist, or what.  or be IN therapy- can channel people's ""dark sides"" so easily, it MUST be a sign....must use my powers for good, must use my powers for good....! e 
Hey Katy, I was just curious if you had any interest in attending the reception below.  Sounds like it might be interesting to me.  Drop me a line and let me know if it sounds like fun and I'll go ahead and get a couple of tickets. Talk to you soon, Susan 2001 Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Corporate Partners Spring Reception, April 3! 
Sorry I never got back to you last night...I ended up going to grab dinner.  I'm still up for this evening if you are.  The ""show"" starts at 8:00 and I think it's about a $10.00 cover.  Either shoot me an email or I'll give you a call a little later this afternoon.  I don't think I have you work number anymore though, so if you wouldn't mind giving that to me again that would be great. See ya later, Susan 
So... tomorrow night?  You, me Mucky Duck???  Whatever is good... we can go for a little while or whatever.  Do you know how much it costs? I am flexible... live music with a drink or two and good conversation sounds pretty darn good... Let me know and I will talk to you soon... AND if this doesn't work out for some reason... no worries and we will re-schedule soon! :o)  Jen _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com 
He was over again last night.  Please explain to me why you would invite your ""man"" over to your apartment when you have a roommate and he lives alone.  I simply do not understand.  I took full advantage of the fact Ted lived alone...we never hung out at my apartment.  Where's the fun in that?  I just think it's weird. Talk to you later, 
Thanks Shannon...I appreciate all the help you've given me over the last year and would be happy to return the favor in the future if there's anything you need. Good luck to you as well in your own endeavors. 
Denise, here are a few things off the top of my head. 1.  I mostly work for the Transwestern Commercial Group, which is the following cast of characters: Steve Harris Kevin Hyatt Lindy Donoho Jeff Fawcett TK Lohman Christine Stokes Michelle Lokay Lorraine Lindberg When I am not on 47, I sit near their work area on 41 (and forward my phone to x34516).  These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize meetings with, distribute things to, etc.  Their assistant is Audrey Robertson.  I lost our most recent phone list but please get one from her (x35849). 2.  Usually I get in around 8:30 and leave around 6.  I'm not picky about when you're in the office; it is very rare that I will need you to come in early or stay late.  I think I asked Janet only twice. 3.  Major projects I'm working on right now that you'll hear me mention a lot: - TW Options (a tariff filing) - Order 637 compliance - Caithness/Big Sandy (potential pipeline interconnect) 4.  Standing meetings: - TW Commercial Group staff meeting:  Monday at 9:30 - Omaha regulatory staff meeting:  Tues. at 8:15. - Therapist:  every few weeks Thurs. 9:00 (if anyone asks, I'm in a meeting; but if they knew where I really was I'm sure they would understand!) 5.  Faxes:  I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call first.  Please check the fax machine once a day (and my chair, if I'm not on 47 that day, in case someone got a fax for me and put it there). 6.  Mail:  Please open my mail, and I'll try to come pick it up every day. 7.  Filing:  I generally avoid keeping files of useless information. However, since I'm a regulatory lawyer it is inevitable that I will have a ton of paper to stash away where I can find it later.  Filing is pretty important to me.  I promise to try to let you know what files are more important than others so you can prioritize.  The good news:  I rarely ever go to the extent where I would have you index a file.  Just putting things in the right folder is enough. 8.  Computer files:  At the beginning of each quarter, please create a new Word file folder (if you look under sscott you'll see I have 2ndqtr00, 3rdqtr00, etc.) 9.  Calendar:  Please obtain access to my Lotus Organizer, and if you get e-mails of meetings I'm supposed to attend go ahead and put them in the calendar. 10.  Friends you're likely to hear from a lot:  Ann, Bill, my grandmother (""Ms. Savoy""), Dianna 11.  The Other Susan Scott:  There is a Susan M Scott who works for ENA.  I get her mail and phone calls all the time!  Her extension is 31445.  Not sure of her location as it seems to change a lot. 
Hi Shannon, Could you be sure to remove my name from the distribution and replace it with George Huan...he has taken over my roll running the options book. Thanks, Susan 
Best Product Placement:  Taking corporate sponsorship to absurdly intimate levels, Pepsi spokesdiva Britney Spears wore a tiny medallion with the soft-drink company's logo in her bellybutton ring during her much hyped commercial. Although, considering the amount of money the company has sunk into her, it may have been a homing device. 
Starts at eight....would love to go, at least for a while.  I'll give you a call later to discuss. 
you wanna go?  what time?  sounds like fun :o) 
FYI:  Trish Murphy is playing at the Mucky Duck tomorrow night....thought you might be interested.  Drop me a line. 
I have to be in S.A. on the 6th for Lisa's bridesmaid's luncheon...So I was thinking, what if I came up to Austin Thursday night and we made a trip to the Saxon Pub.  Just a thought.  If you have exams, papers, etc. that will be consuming you that week disregard the suggestion, but if not it could be fun.  Hope you're having a good day and that you finished your Note to your satisfaction. 
Have to agree with your assessment.  And, I promise she will try like the d= ickens to do stuff with Niklaus (sp?) maybe at the expense of doing things = with you.  Mitch is the guy she's been seeing for about a month now.  He ca= me over last night to watch the Oscar's with us.  Me in a wing-back and Lis= a and Mitch holding hands, rubbing arms etc., on the couch.  This is the se= cond time I can recall since being in the apartment with her that I've had = to witness the ""cuddle fest.""  Not to mention the ""cuddle fest"" we all witn= essed with Chad at Europa.  Maybe if she does come over you could be the li= ttle red devil on her shoulder encouraging her to hook up with Nik...force = her to make some sort of decision about all these guys.  She's in heat righ= t now I swear.  Every 5 sec. there's some new guy she thinks is hot.  The g= uy serving us at Jason's Deli might be the next victim.  She's totally out = of control.  I must say I loved the way she casually suggested the Nik prob= ably wasn't your type anyway...covering all the bases.  It's really pitiful= you know...I'm just glad we will never have the same taste in men.  Did I = mention that Laura White's fiancee asked Laura what was going on with Mitch= and I at Kenneally's b/c I was spending more time with him than Lisa (she = was of course performing the role of social butterfly).  Like I said, it's = pitiful.  In actuality, I think I'm the only one of her ""friends"" that have= met Mitch and think he's all right  I'm pretty sure everyone else has told= her they think she can do better.  I beg to differ, knowing Lisa a little = better than them (i.e. the many faces of eve) and would argue instead that = he's a pretty good catch for her...caves eventually but not perceived (at l= east by her) as a complete push-over.  Perfect combo for our Ms. Gillette. Can you believe my parents?  They were only in San Diego for all of 12 hrs = and took a roll of film...what dorks. Sue I'll work on the trip thing...the timing sounds good to me. =20

I am destined to be a dork....it's in the genes. 
Tried to call you last night but to no avail.  Know that you were out having fun.  Mom came to San Diego and we took some pix.  Here are a few. We called Cris and Chuck and sent them an email with  these pictures. Love, Dad  There is one of me with the Starship in Wichita and the rest are on us in San Diego.  We walked over to the Fish Market on the bay and ate there.  It was really nice. We had a table on the water and had a great meal. - Img00012.JPG - Img00046.JPG - Img00047.JPG - Img00048.JPG - Img00049.JPG - Img00050.JPG - Img00051.JPG - Img00052.JPG

Lia Hernandez, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at ENA effective August 2, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the marketing affiliate rules, Lia's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or applications should be removed at the close of business on August 1.  In addition, Lia's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass distribution  lists should be changed. Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, verifying and indicating the date that employee was: - removed from the LAN - EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable) - removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications - email post office box was transfered.

Susan Scott x30596 
Janet, please meet with Denise (tomorrow if possible) to: - explain filing system - hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and next week is fine) - explain how you do service lists for FERC filings. Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Denise access to my Lotus Organizer. Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Denise's station but see if you can do this also. I spoke with Mike, and Emily is going to handle moving the phones. 
I hated to e-mail all of you but I honestly do not know how to handle the attached which was forwarded to me, and thought one of you might.  Any clues...please advise.  Thanks. Lora Ellis@ECT 04/06/2000 10:59 AM

Somehow the ""one-part rate"" glossary item fell off of TW's list so I've revised it again. 
I agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental requirements are met.  The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an ""eligible facility"" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i):  they are necessary to provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate. The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,200,000.  (Sec. 157.208).  If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek a 7(c) certificate. I've researched the incremental rate question and here's what I've been able to find out: In the context of a 7(c) application, FERC generally requires use of existing Part 284 rates.  This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to construct the San Juan lateral.  TW requested a separate zone rate for the lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was not the appropriate forum.  The Commission stated, however, that it would be willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part 284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral.  So TW made a Section 4 filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the lateral. Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau rates. As for whether an open season would be required, I assume it would not be if Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral.  However, if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll probably want to have an open season.  In any event, in the context of a 7(c) application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it would be to our advantage to sell 100% of the new capacity. At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for the Big Sandy lateral...ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed. I hope this helps...if there are further questions or if any of this does not sound right to you let me know. Michele Winckowski                08/17/2000 01:39 PM 
As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this project. The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental). With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions: Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project. Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore, would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the proposed facilities would be blanket eligible? Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate filing or is a case-specific certificate required? As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season required for the project?  My opinion is ""NO"".  Do you agree? Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks MW 
First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of $650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is reasonable. I'll try to answer all your questions: Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse as we would be removing light items for heavier items. A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor, there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a waterbed, though! Q.  The stove is a bit problematic... A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give the appliance folks a call. Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed? A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude. Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for sure? A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off. Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric? A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and towels dry than with electric! If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible. Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this? A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves. Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover? A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend. The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical? As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get everything done then if that's okay with y'all. Call if you have further questions! 
Drew -- here is Lorraine's update on the Val Verde situation that I mentioned in my previous e-mail.   Recall that we've been unable to accept quantities of gas from Burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect in recent years.  I've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as soon as possible to reflect what we CAN do. The proposed amendment Lorraine is referring to, which Burlington rejected, modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 250,000 MMBtu. // Burlington Resources - Val Verde Plant - Michelle and I had a follow-up conversation with BR Thursday.  I faxed the proposed amendment to BR Monday and we hadn't heard from them yet.  They claim approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues because we are holding their production down.  Michele and Darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas.  I mentioned to BR that we were putting this info together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 190,000 MMBtu from about mid-June through July, our data would not accurately reflect BR's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190.  They will not 
Terminability of Val Verde interconnect agreement 
I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take the following steps: 1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since gone month-to-month.) 2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
Yesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options.  Overall the meeting was very positive.  We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the marketing representatives.  However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed Ross) had a couple of issues.  The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate concern.  Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.  They have run into situations in which pipelines (examples:  Koch, El Paso) have blatantly favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do deals with them.  (In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's price option deals with its affiliate.)  The perception is that the affiliates, by using ""funny money,"" can always make themselves the highest bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline + affiliate).  The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder.  The presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.   Dynegy's proposal would encourage affiliates to pay ""real"" dollars. While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation on options transactions with marketing affiliates.   It is likely that other pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the precedent set by our filing.  Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with affiliates.  Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and our reactions were the same.  Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to do business with TW.   We can probably expect an intervention with comments or a limited protest addressing the issue. The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal as a negotiated rate.  My analysis of this issue is that since we're proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed.  If you think this is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it before we file the tariff sheets.  Sarah's question seemed to be more one of curiosity rather than a basis for protest. Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer meeting to discuss the service.  Jeff and the rest of the commercial group are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting. 
Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee. The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know. I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas or questions. As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss their questions?  Let me know what you think. Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting first, and when FERC staff is available to talk. 
Here is a chart cross-referencing Gas Daily price points with points of TW, for purposes of imbalance valuation.  If you have questions call Jeff or me. 
Susan, As requested in yesterday's meeting, Lindy and I came up with the attached matrix of prices for purposes of valuing TW imbalances.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
I believe this message was intended for Susan M Scott of ENA.  I'm with ETS Legal. 
Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing. There are a couple of important changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""  At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved. The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case. I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to discuss the following topics: 1)  Your comments and questions on this draft, 2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 4)  Comments received from shippers thus far. I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting time. I will be out Mon. and Tues. 
In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for project development: Retainer:  $1000/month plus expenses Accepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles):  Proposal $5000 Each month TW actively negotiating project:  $1500/month (each project) Letter of Intent:  $5000 Signed Agreement:  $10,000 Incentive Fee:  To be determined When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects.  In his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) and market development services (including SoCal OIR related services -- $3000/mo.).  This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure only. The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and third party ""identified by IGS under this agreement.""  As you know, the ""identified by"" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW Commercial Group worked on the deal.  Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to Transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement. Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per-project basis.  This immediately eliminates the ""identified by"" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on. I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement.  If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project, as needed).  For each project, we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement.  I've outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion.  The numbers are Mark's; we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.  I've omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent are of little value to Transwestern. Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to proceed. From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present brief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern.  If Transwestern desires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the following terms and conditions: 1.  Retainer for project development:  $1000/month plus expenses.  Project development shall include but not be limited to:  research, due diligence, market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically authorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of Transwestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written proposal.  Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other project-specific requirements.  Transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to terminate the project. 2.  If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal (or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay IGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the project].  ""Accepting the project"" means that the project meets Transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion.  Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to completion. 3.  If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project, it shall pay IGS $10,000.  Additionally, the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project). (I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.). 
COMMUNICATION 
Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and my initial impressions.  Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP. 12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement: Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an interruptible basis. Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded. Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages). The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause. 2/18/93 letter amendment: Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140).  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement. 9/25/95 letter amendment: Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San Juan expansion is effective. My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements.  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can argue impossibility of performance.  Also, we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure.  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years. The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say we should have known by now).  Burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive system modifications.  That argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly 
FYI. 
TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE INTERACTIVE OPEN SEASON APPROVAL Please review the attached announcement of Transwestern's Interactive Open Season to be held Thursday, August 10, 2000.  Transwestern will be offering 14,000 Dth/d of East of Thoreau to PG&E/Topock capacity for a term of April 1, 2001 - October 31, 2001.  Alternate capacity rights associated with the primary capacity shall include alternate receipts in Transwestern's East of Thoreau Area, excluding Rio Puerco, and alternate deliveries at SoCal/Needles, Mojave/Topock and the Citizens Griffith delivery point . Please approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  Your immediate attention is appreciated as our goal is to post the announcement as quickly as possible in the morning of Friday, August 4th. 
Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time). My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5). If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate. Any questions -- give me a call. S. Christine Stokes 08/03/2000 09:26 AM 
Susan, please review the following IOS posting.  Thanks. 
I do not see any problems with this. James Centilli 08/01/2000 02:53 PM

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant changes include: - added definition of Counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated rate - added an example of how options will work I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from the market. Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will have Janet call to determine your availability. 
As you requested. 
Shelley, I can take a stab at pulling together TW-related information today and will run it by Jeff to see whether he has anything to add.  I am leaving on vacation Saturday and have a lot of other work to finish up here before I go.  Therefore it might be best to bring in someone else from legal/regulatory to pull up the info for El Paso, Kern, etc. Shelley Corman 12/06/2000 10:28 PM 
With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in California, Steve Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of disruptions (e.g. curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain flowing to Calif and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event. Specifically, he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif. In particular, he wants a summary of following: Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? Curtailment compensation Imbalance Provisions Penalties/OFOs Allocations (For El Paso Only) Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Steve wants this all pulled together by Friday. 
Matt, here are redlined and clean versions.  Let me know whether the revisions are acceptable. Thanks, Susan 
Hi Mum!  Sorry I have not called you back.  I have been out late every nite and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.  Am on the trading floor this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.  But I'll give you a call this afternoon. Our little bar examinee is alive and well.  They've changed the schedule so the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.  She joined me and my work crowd last night at La Griglia and we ordered champagne.  So I've already celebrated appropriately! What do you think of my Destin idea? talk to you soon Love, 
Needs to be an officer or someone with power of attorney.  Ordinarily, you do not have power of attorney unless there is board of director approval authorizing you to sign contracts on behalf of the company. The point is to make sure someone signs it who is authorized to bind the company to the obligations of the agreement; otherwise they could argue later that the agreement is not valid. Kenneth Chow 07/27/2000 08:05 AM 
Susan, Does it have to be an officer of the company (West Penetone, NiGen International) that signs the agreement? Or is it ok for the sales rep to sign it? Thanks, Ken

This should be so much easier; Foti is not cooperating so I am having to spend time hunting down his Co. # and RC #, which hopefully Estalee will be able to provide.  I reiterate my position that lawyers are not the ones who should have to do this.  Rest assured I'll follow through on this one and Lia Hernandez, but I also feel we need to approach Dave Schafer and ask why this is something HR is not capable of taking care of. 
David Foti, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at EES effective August 1, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the marketing affiliate rules, Dave's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or applications should be removed at the close of business on July 31.  In addition, Dave's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass distribution  lists should be changed. Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, verifying and indicating the date that employee was: - removed from the LAN - EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable) - removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications - email post office box was transfered. If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know. 
Thanks Keith.  Feel free to coordinate with Jeff to put together a meeting to get the info you need.  I do not know the answer to your questions offhand, and Ron is out this week. Keith Petersen 07/26/2000 09:47 AM 
The prior notice blanket was a possibility, but with the change in diameters it most likely won't work.  I agree with you a 7 (c) filing would be required.  I noticed they are discussing environmental information below, but what is the status of preparing the reports?  If we are to make the filing, we need a meeting to make sure that everyone is gathering the proper information.  In some of our other filings we conducted town hall meetings prior to survey work to gain support of the people.  This should be being. A question I have is ""will the mainline need to be expanded?""  How do they plan to serve the load from a fully subscribed pipe? (I believe it is fully subscribed) Thanks Keith 
According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16"" pipe to provide service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur? Any comments? 
TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward. Caithness Corporation Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light. Big Sandy Project The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d. The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station #1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline. The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of 200. Project Schedule Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000 Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000 Arrange financing     December 2000 EIS approval      March 2001 Construction begins     April 2001 Testing begins      July 2002 Commercial Operation     November 2002 There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known to be present in the area. Lateral Pipeline Alignment The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed. If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system. Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original estimate to construct a 16"" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was based on the following specifications: 120 MMcf/d 450 psig delivery pressure, 900 psig inlet pressure The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the design will likely change to a 20"" pipeline.

Sempra shall have alternate delivery point rights at the California Border as well as alternate receipt point rights in Transwestern's EOT Area. Please confirm via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  All Officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval. 
Here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement. 
Well, Larry just won't let go of these contract issues, will he?? I believe the answer is that SWGas will always be billed based on the one-part rate, regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components. My understanding is that the reason we reserve the right to allocate the components is simply for internal accounting purposes, to keep any one component from exceeding the max or going below the min. Hope this helps; let me know if you have further questions! Lorraine Lindberg 07/25/2000 02:59 PM 
Any advice on how to respond? 
Lorraine, Confirmation that I did receive your executed TSA and Letter Agreement. I'm so glad you are excited.  We have so little in our lives to give us true excitement.  At my age, I try to reserve all events of elevated blood pressure for only the esoteric things.  (Just kidding.)  I'm very pleased we finally got this done.  Now for the pipe wrench and welder folks to get the physical jobs done, as well. Unfortunately, the work is never over.  I will now try to concentrate on the OBA, which has been sitting by the sideline for a long time.  Will get back to you on that as soon as I can. As for the TSA rate, I have a few questions.  We have agreed that TWPL would allocate the rate between fixed and variable components.  I have never been clear on just when and how that will be done.  I have assumed you would make that call, let us know, and it would be over.  Is there any idea that issue would be a changing thing, or is it ""once done, always done""?  Further, what factors do you use to make that determination and what, if any, rules and regulations apply?  From different views, I'd like to have it all variable and you would like to have it all fixed.  What is the process here? I will get back to you soon on the OBA stuff.  Meanwhile, chill that champagne! Larry - llblack.vcf 
Ken, here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to our providing information to our vendors.  Each agreement should be printed as duplicate originals on TW letterhead, and signed by an officer of TW.  I understand that Mike Nelson is out due to a death in the family; Steve Harris is out this week also.  Perhaps Julia White would be willing to sign in order to expedite things. If you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these agreements please do not hesitate to call (x30596) or come by. 
No probola!  It will be good to have an excuse to go to NM.  Maybe I will go this weekend. So glad you had rain over the weekend!  We did too, and we had had a dry spell for almost as long.  I hope it was not too late to save my back yard, which was starting to smell like cooked grass. Bill and I are on the outs.  He just will not do what he needs to in order to make things work, so I have given up.  Of course now he is trying to be charming.  Anyway, I will have to tell you the whole story some other time. The kiddies are going back to school already so now would be a good time to plan a trip to D.C. at last.  Maybe early Sept? Also I'd be game for a girls' trip to Destin. Time to work! Love, Sooz Camp2scott@aol.com on 07/24/2000 08:50:44 PM 
Hi, Sooz, Don't make a special trip, but the next time you're at the Galleria, would you go by the Neiman's Clientele make-up counter (by the candy) and get something for me?  Clientele Wrinkle Treatment.  It'll be pricy, but just let me know and I'll get a check to you. love, mum 
Darlin', Someone booked the entire Rainbow Lodge for a party this p.m. As alternatives, Chez Sooz recommends: La Mora Brennan's Please advise. xxxooo 
Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles interconnect with SoCal.  Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles but does not extend the same privilege to TW. I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it with Jeff when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.

According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16"" pipe to provide service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur? Any comments? 
TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward. Caithness Corporation Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light. Big Sandy Project The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d. The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station #1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline. The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of 200. Project Schedule Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000 Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000 Arrange financing     December 2000 EIS approval      March 2001 Construction begins     April 2001 Testing begins      July 2002 Commercial Operation     November 2002 There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known to be present in the area. Lateral Pipeline Alignment The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed. If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system. Other Preliminary Project Issues There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original estimate to construct a 16"" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was based on the following specifications: 120 MMcf/d 450 psig delivery pressure, 900 psig inlet pressure The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the design will likely change to a 20"" pipeline.

I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure everything is addressed before filing. Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review beginning TODAY.

Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14. The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows: Final draft comments   Friday, July 14 Circulate draft to customers, customer meetings, time for customers to respond, informal discussion with FERC   Mon.

Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what we have posted before. One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable Topock space is part of that package. Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call. 
Oops, I meant to send this note to Mary Darveaux instead -- my apologies! 
I know you do not want to think about this today, but I'm just thinking ahead to next week.  Let's come up with an action plan for drafting TW's Order 637 compliance filing.  You two should be experts by now!  Give me a call Monday or Tuesday, and let's discuss getting started, and I will get to work on a draft.  I still have the marked up tariff sheets from when we talked about this in March or April. 
Hi Mum.  Sept. 29 sounds great; I have always wanted to see Chorus Line.  So go ahead and order tickets if you like. I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.  Allie's wedding is Dec. 16.  at Sundance.  If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I could hit the bunny slopes together.  I want to take lessons, and stick to the easy runs.  No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it is. Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.  I have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico, and have told him so.  So I'm not sure what will happen.  Are you interested in going to San Miguel for the running of the bulls? Hope the Hip Abductors are not demanding too much as ransom. Love, Sooz Camp2scott@aol.com on 07/13/2000 10:32:35 AM 
Hi, Sooz!  What are you doing Sat, Sept 29?  Was just checking over the Broadway series at the Paramount, and ""Chorus Line"" is coming for a 2-wk period.  I would love to see it.  I could probably find someone to go with on a weeknight, but would prefer going with you if you're available.  Let me know.  I'll be leaving for Calif a few days later, Oct 3. Eric had a fatty tumor removed from just under his shoulder Mon.  Called him when I returned from Houston to check on him and he surprised and shocked me by saying he was not skiing with his L.A. group this year, and wants me to go on some ski trips with him.  It's one of those things you wish for, and then you get it?  Oh no.  I don't even know if I'll really progress past the beginner slope, but am sure I'll be very good at apres.  I think he's considering Park City for the first one.  He says the transportation there is good, and it's a good place for me to learn. Darrell went with me to The Hills Tues. and I discovered the Hip Abductors! Wow.  Didn't feel the workout until after my walk last night.  Sure hope all this is doing some good.  Checked their long list of reciprocal clubs, and The Met isn't one of them, but that doesn't matter.  You can still go as a guest.  (Neither is the Los Gatos Ath. Club.)  Must check out exercises for skiing. Went to the lab early this a.m. for pre-physical tests.  Had a late lunch yesterday and no dinner, so I was starved when I woke up.  They opened at 7:00 and there wasn't much of a wait. Fabion had disappeared for a few weeks, and Mike had lined up another guy to mow for us, but Fabion showed up--he had been in Mexico.  Sure glad to see him.  He's from some town near San Miguel. K, J & G are coming for an overnight Sat.  Karin has a haircut appt.  Glad for the company. Mother's a/c went out in her car as she was leaving Austin on the 5th.  All that way to Houston in the heat.  At least she left early.  She just spent $800 for a new compressor for that old heap.  Couldn't believe it.  She had just spent $200 for freon on her previous trip--it all leaked out.  Even with her other gas guzzler, $1000 would have gone a long way paying for gas. Hope you're having a good week.  Did Bill make it home?  love, mum

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing. The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What exactly do we mean by ""no additional cost...unless through the allocation process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel""??   Can someone help me with this? Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright. However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language.  Or they could tell us to remove the ""subject to transportation and fuel"" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer. However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC. Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Paul, governing law in paragraph 9 needs to be Texas.  If this is a problem, give me a call because we'll need to discuss it with Drew. Subject to this one change, I approve this agreement. 
At PNM's request we are not going to say anything about long-term having a higher priority than short-term, because their tariff simply does not reflect this.  Unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could have said it, but ... Anyway, I like what Steve has done here.  If there is no objection I'm going to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow.

Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to FERC decisions. In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ? 61,102, reh'g denied, 75 FERC ? 61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings. In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ? 61,394 (1997), the Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes operationally available for various reasons from time to time. But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of ""pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is 
thanks, Donna -- good work. 
Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word ""volumetric"" as that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.  I.e., if we were truly to have ""volumetric"" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate schedule!  I just don't want to use this word.  I don't think it's necessary in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  ""on a daily basis only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized"". If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more issues I am sending him to law school as punishment. Lorraine Lindberg 07/07/2000 09:49 AM

Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several minor ""sentence structure"" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been included. Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596). The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter: 1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts. 2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper. Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area. The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis.

Since I am swamped I've asked Steve Stojic to take a first crack at it. 
Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!  Several of my neighbors were also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.  I don't know whether we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.  Jose and Gigi's party was attended by more kids than ever.  There were a lot of West U parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.  We did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi with the pinatas, and got home around 7.  The traffic on I-45 was really starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did. Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit. Love, 
Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present. 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale. 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year. 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option. 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether. 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance. 6.  Timeline: - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week) - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing) - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron) - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on) - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet) If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to 
Hey!  I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat.  Bill won't be coming with me because he has 3 trial settings on July 3, what a drag.  I will probably go home on Mon. afternoon.  Our friends are having their lake house party on the 4th.  Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some. Can't wait to see Gbug!  You know Mema is going to be really excited to see her eat carrots.  (I think she's coming in on Sunday.)

Hi! Fancy hearing from ME! Just checking in to see what your weekend plans are like when will you be in Austin? Are you bringing Bill? Do you want to play tennis w/ Jim, etc!  Jim has an appointment to get his fro -glo going at 12 on Saturday, so we will be hitting Austin that morning and will probably stay through Sun. evening or possibly Monday morning. They have decided to give us Monday off, but we still need to get things done around the house, so we can't loll around in Austin the WHOLE time! Do you know when Mema will be there? You know, one of these days you are going to get stuck driving her to Austin! Let me know what's going on! Gbug wants to show you how she likes to eat her carrots! Mmmmm! And she wants to try out her boat in the pool. Bye! Karin

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in edgewise.  Is there any way to make this more fruitful? If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together before close of business Friday as I'm out all next week for surgery. 
So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached. If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other. Thank you. 
Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement. Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues. I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks. 
Never fear.  I've asked Janet to set up a meeting on Fri. and to make sure the core group of you, Drew, Steve and I can attend.  If anyone else can attend too, great.  If not, I'm sure we are going to have more than enough input on Fri. Jeffery Fawcett 06/28/2000 04:33 PM

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY Please review the attached non-standard discount letter for Sempra Energy Trading Corporation.  Pursuant to Sempra's Gallup Expansion Agreement allowing Sempra the right to ""call"" upon SoCalNeedles capacity, subject to availability, at a $.30 rate,  Sempra has requested to obtain 23,000 Dth/d of East of Thoreau (EOT) to SoCalNeedles capacity for the July - October term. Sempra's blended rate of $.2928 represents 21,500 Dth/d of capacity at $.30/Dth (their ""call"" capacity) and 1,500 Dth/d of additional Needles capacity sold to them at $.19/Dth. Non-standard provisions contained in Sempra's original Gallup expansion Agreement  are included in the discount letter and contained in Paragraphs 3 and 4: Paragragh 3 grants Sempra the ability to have alternate delivery points in Transwestern's EOT Area at the discounted rate in situations where SoCalGas' ""window""  can be shown to reduce Sempra's nominated deliveries to SoCalGas. Sempra must provide Transwestern a written confirmation from SoCalGas indicating a reduction in scheduled volumes in order to obtain such alternate delivery capacity at the discounted rate.  If written confirmation is either not provided or Sempra elects to transport on an alternate basis to the EOT Area due to favorable market conditions, then the rate for such transport shall be the discounted rate plus $.01. Paragragh 4 grants Sempra the ability during the term of the July - October transportation agreement, to move their primary delivery point from SoCalNeedles to PG&E/Topock, Mojave /Topock, or to the potential SWG interconnect subject to capacity availability and a 5 day notification period.  Sempra may also have the ability to return to the SoCalNeedles delivery during this term subject to the described conditions as well. Please indicate you approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  If any questions arise, please contact me at x35702. 
So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached. If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other. Thank you. 
Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement. Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues. I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks. 
This document contains both the El Paso and TW information.  I'll bring you the printouts of the relevant El Paso tariff provisions. 
Well, I have definitely taken a turn for the worse -- lots of drainage and coughing up green/yellow stuff.  No fever at all, though.  I go to the doctor tomorrow and hopefully will be on the road to recovery before Saturday. Received Jim's capilene shirts; they are nice.  But I wanted to double check with you to make sure I got the right ones -- he wanted the medium-weight ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts, right?  The reason I am asking is that Patagonia also makes a capilene that is more like a fleece fabric and comes in a v-neck style... I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema.  The last thing I want to do is buy her something she does not need!  Will stick to my pedicure gift certificate idea. So glad you are doing better.  Too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble! Camp2scott@aol.com on 12/04/2000 04:04:44 PM

Hi Mum!  If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would be fun.  I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about what they do.  Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of my long-range plan.  If not, I will have met some interesting people. If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on Monday morning. The week is going OK.  All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore muscles so this is my night off.  Am planning to do some more house chores so I do not end up with another weekend like the last. I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, but I'll let you know. Call if you get lonely! Love, Sooz Camp2scott@aol.com on 06/22/2000 05:47:31 PM 
Hi, Sooz, Got home about 1 p.m. today and can already feel my mood sinking--not ready to get back into my solo mode. Enjoyed being with the little bugaroo--even with the diarrhea, she was in a good mood with the exception of an occasional sore bottom.  She smiles all the time.  It does wear me out considerably when I have her all day long though, and, especially this time, when I was tired from our trip and Eric's visit. I must think about a trip to Houston.  Are you aware of the big Houston art day in the galleries on July 8th?  Just caught a glimpse of it when thumbing through the new SW Art Mag.  I'll track it down and give you the particulars. (You'll have to review your travel schedule with me again.) Hope you're having a good week.  love, Mum 
Ramona, ""total cost commitment"" in TW's tariff generally means total revenue to be received from a transaction, taking into account reservation rate, the term of the commitment, and the commodity revenues associated with any minimum throughput commitment the shipper may make.  Obviously some of these items aren't applicable in the PNR context; the language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff.  For PNR we would just multiply rate times number of days the service will be used.  Practically speaking, I'm not sure how this is done if you have an interruptible service with no throughput commitment, but I think you should just be able to use the number of days in the contract term. If there's a tie (i.e. more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max rate), we just allocate the capacity pro-rata.  We do not have to offer a right to match. Ramona Betancourt 06/19/2000 03:52 PM 
Susan, I am working with TK on automating TW's PNR allocation process & I was reviewing the tariff rules for TW PNR allocation of service on sheet 37e. Section 8. Can you interpret the meaning of ""total cost commitment""? We state that buyers willing to pay more than the maximum tariff rate will be considered to be paying the maximm rate and we will pro-rate amoung buyers willing to pay the same total cost commitment. Does this mean we must offer a right to match? What does the term ""total cost commitment mean? Thanks Ramona 
With regard to capacity release I think we will have to give the replacement shipper the cash-for-fuel option, because what if we have sold capacity that was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us?  If the replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel, that capacity goes away. (It's sort of like the EFBH/resulting forward haul problem).  Probably we should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the replacement shipper.  This would probably have to go into our tariff someplace when we make our FERC filing; otherwise it might run contrary to our current tariff provisions and practice.  Another solution might be to just sell resulting capacity as LFT, daily FTS-1 or even FTS-3 capacity (with some modifications to the FTS-3 Rate Schedule, of course), which would allow us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days.  For longer-term deals this might not be practicable, though. Further questions...let me know. Ramona Betancourt 06/20/2000 02:04 PM 
Christine, After our meeting last week, John, Elizabeth, Gerry, Richard, Dave & I discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process. We had several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows: Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel discount  cash option to an acquiring shipper?     If we must offer this special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper. This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at this time. Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?  Could we default these ""02"" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using our existing tariff fuel %?  This would  make the process of trying to reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes scheduled & paid for in cash.. Tariff Sheet issue:  When you state in the tariff provision that ""The shipper may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a receipt point on shipper's service agreement"" Does this only apply to the shipper's primary receipt points? I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please let me know. Thanks Ramona

I would expect that Sarah Tomalty will attend anyway to make sure we make good on our promise. 
Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably (i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.

Kevin -- I've looked at the pooling agreement and I agree with you -- I don't believe taking the compressor down is at all limited under the agreement. 
If I remember correctly, we'll need to paper the additional Sempra capacity, either with an amendment or a separate agreement.  I'll be in the office by 
Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some other basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did not find any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware, the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to its shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlying presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting discriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says this even though it should be obvious. Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA (doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to participate in the auction process. Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the Enrononline process. Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for determining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case. In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  ""The Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology before the bidding process begins.""  The only problem is I am not sure we have that ""flexibility"" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post a different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some language allowing us to do so. I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what you write I'd be happy to. 
Mike, please see the attached, which incorporates the changes we discussed yesterday.  If this looks acceptable to you, please sign two originals and forward them to me.  Thanks. Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company 1400 Smith St., Room 4788 Houston, TX 77007 
Christine Stokes 06/05/2000 10:07 AM 
Susan, I promise this will be the last time we go through this.  Attached is the draft letter.  I have added the words for the discount paragraph ""for the term of the contract"" as you requested.  Please provide the additional language for the paragragh regarding our retaining  revenues of capacity release above the discount level being subject to FERC approval, otherwise if not accepted by the FERC then not applicable. Thanks! . 
Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those months.  I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would work.  We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I recall correctly. Also --  I agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if SWG agrees to include the capacity release provision.  In case FERC does not like the provision for some reason, do we want to provide that disapproval by FERC will invalidate the whole contract (see language in the recent USGT contract), or do we want it to invalidate just that provision and let the rest of the deal stand?  It would depend on how much value the parties are attaching to that provision and whether we would want a chance to renegotiate...and I am assuming we would.  Christine, let me know which is preferable and I'll send you some language in the a.m. 
Since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the function within the business unit (or any firewalls that are set up), since he works for ECT I have to say I would be uncomfortable putting him on the distribution list.  I know that he has access to the same info, but to give him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule. I am out of town, but if you have any questions please e-mail or leave me a voice mail, and I will reply after my hearing today.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Southwest Gas Corporation (SWG).  SWG shall enter into a 10 year agreement  for 14,000 Dth/d of seasonal (November through March) capacity effective November 1, 2000.  The transport rate of $.15/Dth/d shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d.  The primary path shall be from Tranwestern's  East of Thoreau (EOT) Area  to the SWG Interconnect located in the East of California Area. Alternate receipt point rights shall be from Tranwestern's EOT Area and from the Bloomfield Compressor.   SWG ROFR rights shall be wiaved. In additionTranswestern shall propose  to retain revenues generated by capacity release at rates higher than the effective contract's discount rate. (Please note that the FTS-1 Appendix A - not shown here with the discount letter-  specifically indicates 0 MMcf/d capacity for the April through October period.  Therefore, even though the $.1500/MMBtu rate in Paragraph 3 of the discount letter does not indicate the rate is a ""seasonal rate"", the effective billing to SWG shall be seasonal.) Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.   All Officer approvals shall be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval. 
Christine, this looks fine to me.  Please circulate to the appropriate people for approval with a notation that Appendix or Exhibit whatever provides that the quantity goes to zero during Apr-Oct.  If you need to reach me, I'll be logged in from about 9 to 10 a.m. your time before I go to our hearing here in SF.  Sorry for the late response; it's been a little crazy out here! Christine Stokes 05/30/2000 03:00 PM 
Hi Susan, Attached below is the draft discount letter to Lorraine's 10 year SWG deal. Please review and provide any revisions if necessary.  FYI,  the base FTS-1 agreement will show that SWG will only have capacity November-March of each year.  Therefore do you agree that  my discount language does not need to incorporate the Nov-March term designation since the discount rate paragraph 3 states that the rate shall be multiplied by the total contract quantity (0 MMcf/d) contract quantity April-Oct)? Thanks for your expedited review.

In response to your inquiries about whether TW's tariff allows the format posting, bidding and awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal, here is my 2 cents' worth. The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal section of TW's tariff (for some reason that's never been clear to me). See Section 13.A. (Sheet No. 18):  ""All available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures, and Transporter will not maintain a firm transportation queue.""  The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding procedures (including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid deadline -- See Section 13.D.) but arguably these timelines only apply to the ROFR bidding process, not to an open season for other capacity.  Even if the one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process, the EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit bids (Tony -- am I right about this?). The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB/Internet section of the General Terms and Conditions (beginning on Sheet No. 72).   TW will continue to comply with all provisions in this section.  The section even specifically provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically. I've found nothing in else in TW's tariff that would appear to address an online open season one way or the other.  I believe our tariff gives us the flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do. Hope this helps.

When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 (1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas transported on the upstream pipeline.  The Commission recognized this as one of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.  Specifically, the Commission stated: The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has acquired on an upstream pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will not, however, allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped.  Thus, the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.  You can feel 
Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial. Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does ""interested parties"" mean? parties interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone to get approval ahead of bidding?). 
Attached is a revised draft of the webtext. You will note that we have added the transportation service request form in the text. The bidder will have to print the form, fill it out and fax it to us because it is our understanding that we can't work it into the website for completion and execution online in the time frame for July 1 service. Also, please note that (1) we have changed the some of the information in the Account Manager grid and (2) the attached draft assumes that the Bid List, from the original text, is the same document as the Account Manager page . We are assuming that we would not be able to get the Transportation Service Agreement available for online execution by clicking for July 1. Thus, we will handle the service agreement manually. However, for subsequent months we contemplate establishing contracting procedures so that the service agreement can be executed online by a click. Frazier and Tony 
I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called (for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest could be scheduled IT. Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of gas is transported. Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what you think. SS 
Please see the attached in connection with sales of capacity options on TW. 
Elizabeth -- As we discussed, billing will need to take place pursuant to Section 30.8(e) (i.e., refund or credit to the releasing shipper). Here is the language you requested for our posting: In accordance with Section 30.9(f) of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's Tariff, Releasing Shipper shall remain liable to Transwestern for payment of reservation charges and any applicable surcharges. 
On Friday the Commission issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) TW's tariff sheets for acquiring PNM capacity, and calling for a technical conference.  The Commission stated that while TW's proposal may be in the public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised by Dynegy in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to include:  whether TW will, in effect, become a marketer for PNM's services, whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Commission noted that while PNM has certificate (i.e., public convenience & necessity) authority to transport gas in interstate commerce, PNM will ""have to either explain how it has appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Commission.""   Lorraine has forwarded a copy of the order to PNM so that they can begin taking the appropriate steps. I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell you when I have further information.  If you would like a copy of the order,

Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20 going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff= =20 filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that= =20 recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or= =20 2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow= ed=20 to charge market based rates.
