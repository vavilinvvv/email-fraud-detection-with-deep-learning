Did anyone take care of Powerex cuts on Friday? I've entered a sale to Powerex to bookout for two hours in which they cut a preschedule (deal 795777/tag 16EV) and were unable to resupply the entire 25 mw. Sale is for HE 13 - 13 mw @ $46, and HE 21 - 6 mw @ $31. Prices are EPE's incremental costs for those hours, used per Steve at El Paso. If any of you have more information about these cuts and how they should have been handled, please let me know. FYI - Cuts were not handled correctly if Real Time Position Manager is not flat when you leave. Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 Fax/503-464-7996 
For Tuesday - STWBOM will be short 75 mw on peak @ SP15. The short is related to three day-ahead pieces which were sold @ $27.20, $28, and $27.11. Make real time purchases to cover the short under the STWHOURLY book. Enter an inter-desk sale from STWHOURLY to STWBOM. Then make a sale under the STWBOM book to the Cal-Imbalance to complete the deal. Please let me know if you have questions.

FYI - I've had a few requests for changes to and enhancements of the EOL Download sheet. Dan Maxwell - of the 4th floor IT group - sent me those changes today. The download now allows you to sort by delivery point, or by hour, and has an added ""refresh"" feature. The date has also been reformatted to fit into our inc sheets (two digit instead of four digit year). Most importantly, the query now pulls in inter-desk swaps done on EOL. The new EOL download is saved in p://real time/increment/windows 2000/NEW EOL DOWNLOAD The sheet is still very basic and self-explanatory, so if you have anything to add, or questions about how to use it, please let me know.

For Thursday - STWBOM will be short 75 mw on peak @ SP15. The three day-ahead pieces were sold @ $27.20 and $28 (BOM sales) and $29.97 (SP15 Peak Day-Ahead Index). Make real time purchases to cover the short under the STWHOURLY book. Enter an inter-desk sale from STWHOURLY to STWBOM. Then make a sale under the STWBOM book to the Cal-Imbalance to complete the deal. Also, STWBOM will be long 20 mw HE 2-5 @ PV. This is a parking deal with PNM done at $16 ($14 purchase price + $2 buy-resale fee). You'll notice we'll be long 20 mw for these hours in Real Time Position Manager. Please enter an inter-desk purchase from STWBOM under the STWHOURLY book @ PV and sell this off real time under STWHOURLY. Let me know if you have questions.

I believe all the bugs have been worked out of this one. It pulls in inter-desk swaps and includes all the features you guys have requested - sorts by delivery point or hour, able to refresh, etc. I've saved the download as EOL Download (in P://Real Time/Increment/Windows 2000) and deleted the file called NEW EOL DOWNLOAD. Test is out and let me know what you think. Thanks. Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 Fax/503-464-7996

FYI - We'll need to pay APS back for transmission line losses incurred on 9/17. Please send them 3 mw during one heavy load hour tomorrow - losses were incurred HE 8, but may be paid back at anytime on-peak. They need the energy delivered at either PV or 4C. Make purchase and sale under STWHOURLY, and please tag this payback as well. Let me know the relevant deal & tag numbers, and I will convey these to APS. Thanks. Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 
As I'm sure you're all aware, it took the group a day or two to hit its stride after EOL was launched on Aug. 20. We have already received approximately 30 disputes filed by various counterparties regarding deals that flowed on the 20th and 21st. Many of these will be especially difficult to settle correctly given the fact there is virtually no documentation or information to be found regarding the original deal. Some deals done on EOL were altered; other bilateral trades were simply zeroed out; and still others exist only in the Inc sheets. This situation outlines the extreme importance of documenting changes in deals as they're being made. If you have reason to zero out a trade done by an earlier shift, or to alter a trade executed online, please convey that reason. Some suggestions: 1. If you have a notebook, and use it, please enter the date on the top of the page every time you start a shift. Without that, your notes are pretty much worthless. 2. Type a short note into the Scheduling Comments section of deals you zero out or change, especially if you're changing them much later than the time they were entered. 3. Use the superfluity of spreadsheets, discussion databases, reports, Enpower applications, cut sheets, and other pieces of paper available to the Real Time group as evidence of your activity while on shift. If this sounds unreasonable, I would welcome suggestions for an alternative. Thanks for your help. Kate Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 
Main Entry: su?per?flu?i?ty Function: noun Inflected Form(s): plural -ties Etymology: Middle English superfluitee, from Middle French superfluit?, from Late Latin superfluitat-, superfluitas, from Latin superfluus 
FYI - We now have access to a program that should help us to use Deal Blotter as a viable tool for online trading. As you know, no more than one trader may access a given blotter at one time (""Trader ID locked"" error message). Instead, DEAL TICKER can be used by those members of the group not currently trading online, as it allows all users read-only access to STWHOURLY deals done on EOL. It also features a handy ""refresh"" function which will allow you to see Real Time deals in a real time fashion. Here's how to use Deal Ticker: 1. Open DEAL TICKER from the Enpower Launch Pad 2. Click the big plus sign 
We're lending again..... The STSW desk will be 20 mw short per the El Paso lending agreement, on peak @ 4C-345kv. The day-ahead sale price is $27.05. Please purchase to cover this position under the STWHOURLY desk and complete an inter-desk sale to STSW to tie out our positions. PLEASE NOTE: INTER-DESK SWAPS ARE NOT THE SAME AS ANNUITIES. YOU CANNOT NET THE DAY'S VOLUME AND SWAP OUT AT ONLY ONE HOUR. YOU MUST BUY AND SELL THE SAME AMOUNT EACH HOUR TO REMAIN AT ZERO EACH HOUR. It's been awhile since we've done this, so here's a reminder of the procedure. Once you've purchased to cover this short in the real time market, you must sell back to El Paso @ $0 to keep our position net zero. Then reduce the day-ahead purchase price from El Paso (794022) to $2 to cover the lending service fee. Please, please, please ask me if you have ANY questions about how to do this. Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 Fax/503-464-7996 
STWBOM is 50 mw short on peak @ SP15. Purchase to cover this under the STWHOURLY book and enter an inter-desk sale to STWBOM. Day-ahead SP15 heavy load price is $28.54. Please let me know if you have questions. Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 Fax/503-464-7996 
FYI - We will be paying back line losses to APS tomorrow @ 4C - 1 mw @ HE 6, 1 mw @ HE 11. I've gone ahead and prescheduled this payback to ensure that it gets tagged. All you have to do is make sure this makes it into the El Paso model (EPE is the source). Following are the deal and tag numbers, just in case..... Deals - 800427/800467 Tag - 34307 Again, no need to do anything for this. Just put in in the model. And let me know if you have questions.

To all whom it may concern - I will be out of the office Thursday, Oct. 4, through Monday, Oct. 8. If you have anything you need addressed prior to Tuesday morning, please reach me on my cell phone. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 Fax/503-464-7996 
Please note - Kathy asked that we update our EPE distribution list. Suggestion - create a personal contact folder in Outlook called ""El Paso"" that includes the following e-mail addresses: kpeterso@epelectric.com tsoto@epelectric.com sburac1@epelectric.com Please let me know if you need help doing this.

FYI - We have a new tool at our disposal to assist in the transfer of EOL information from Enpower to the Inc sheets. I've saved it as the ""EOL Download"" in P://Real Time/Increment/Windows 2000/EOL Download. You can use this workbook to download EOL deals throughout the day. It's fairly self-explanatory, but here are a few suggestions: 1. If necessary, limit your query to one region using the boxes in the upper-left-hand corner. 2. Click ""Download Deals,"" and enter your Enpower password when prompted. Be sure to check that you are downloading for the current day. 3. Once deals have populated the screen (should take no more than 30-45 seconds), filter for the hour and/or delivery point you need. 4. Copy all relevant rows and paste directly into the appropriate Inc sheet. This sheet has just enough flexibility to make it functional and keep it simple. All it does is download EOL deals from Enpower - nothing more. If you'd like to see this expanded upon, feel free to give me suggestions. Thanks.

FYI - It appears the issue of how to execute inter-desk swaps is still not resolved. I've attached the instructional worksheet Bill sent out awhile ago - it is actually a very coherent rendering of the intricacies involved in entering these enigmatic deals. (Read: Inter-desk swaps are not real easy to understand. This worksheet is.) One tip: If STCA is long or short going into the Real Time market, they will have entered a purchase from or sale to the California Imbalance as a sort of ""place holder."" An offsetting purchase or sale will need to be made under the STCA book in order to complete the deal and keep STCA flat. If you're feeling ambitious and want to see the direct effects of putting deals in under the wrong book, run a Forward Obligation report (in Enpower Reports under the Risk tab) for the day, desk, and region in question. If you did everything correctly, the report should produce nothing but zeroes. Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 Fax/503-464-7996 
FYI - 1. Please do not ever, under any circumstances, modify EOL deals in any way. These deals have an embedded contract in them which is created at the moment a counterparty hits your bid or lifts your offer. Also, EOL deals may not be extended in Deal Scheduling. 2. When entering deals to account for ancillary services (i.e. deals with no fixed price, only demand charge price), please make any changes or extensions in Deal Entry rather than Deal Scheduling. Demand charge price is not accounted for when the deal is only extended in Scheduling. Let me know if you have questions about either of these reminders. Thanks for reading this all the way through.

For Saturday - STSW will be 13 mw long, HE 13-20, at West Wing-500KV. Day ahead purchase (made under STSW book) is from PNM. Price is $22. Please enter an inter-desk purchase (under STWHOURLY book) from STSW for these hours. Make sure this purchase price covers any transmission costs the West Hourly book incurs to sell off this power. Enter all transmission deals and respective sales under the STWHOURLY book. Again, please refer to Bill's inter-desk swap detail if you run into problems. Note about Transmission: EPMI owns transmission from Pinnacle Peak to Mead-230 that can be re-directed from West Wing to Mead if necessary. Deal number is 426856. Oasis numbers is 26034. Please see the 2001_Available_Transmission worksheet for more information. Kate Symes Real Time Trading Support Office/503-464-7744 Cell/503-819-2181 Fax/503-464-7996 
Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals should still be made using the counterparty name ""Arizona Public Service Company."" All other deals are made with ""Pinnacle"" itself. This should change sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston. Let me know if you have any questions. 
We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this carefully.... SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell him to do the same. Thanks, 
Just FYI - I believe you entered these deals on Jan. 16. What were you thinking? How long have you worked here? Can you say, ""wrong counterparty name""? Also, why don't you have your own trader ID yet? Geez. Sincerely, Kate P.S. Don't worry - I corrected them for you. 
Please change deal nos. 497905 and 498198 to Los Angelese Department of Water & Power.

If I don't drink anything, you get a ticket to the Blazers/Lakers game on Dec. 13. If I do drink, you pay for it. How's that sound? Kate Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
I actually did get that last e-mail, but somehow it ended up buried at the bottom of my in-box, just like so many other things. As far as the Blazer ticket trade, I believe I bought a call from you on the Laker game, and you bought the option from me on the Cavaliers - so I can choose to exercise on 12/13 at 7 p.m., and you can choose to exercise on 1/16 at 7 p.m. In other words, no matter what happens, I'm going to both games. Got it? As far as good stories from that night, I probably have the best, or at least one of the more hilarious, of those circulating the floor. And no, it has nothing to do with me. Ask me about it later, and I might be able to give it up for firm delivery of a seat at next week's game. Think about it. 
Yeah - I pretty much became part of the furniture yesterday as I recouped from the brutality of that weekend. I ended up at a random friend's house at about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about 6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen

Please accept my apologies for this worksheet's absence yesterday. It was undergoing cosmetic improvements to more accurately represent the EES-EPMI position. Note two new column headings as of 3/27 - ""Transmission"" and ""Other EnPower"" deals. Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2 sheet. This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI. And as always, feel free to contact me with questions. Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486

FYI - All trades done on behalf of El Paso will now be directly billed by El Paso. This means three things for us: 1. Format of the model stays the same. 2. Deals do not go into Enpower. 3. ""Counterparty"" in the model must show the billing counterparty only (to simplify Kathy's settlement process). *Per El Paso, please try to market their power through SRP, PNM, PAC, and LADWP only.* These are the counterparties El Paso has contacted regarding our new arrangement. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks, 
FYI - The Southwest OASIS website (for PNM, SRP, NEVP, EPE, SMUD, SPP, and LADWP transmission reservations) has given us a new login ID and password. Don Norman is no longer our site administrator; Les Rawson has taken that title. I registered us with two user names and passwords, which are as follows: Login: rxtime12 Password: epmipower Login: kxsymes1 Password: realtime Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this new procedure. Thanks, 
Here are the sheets through the weekend..... 
FYI - Bora Brady and Enterprise have both been added as new delivery points in Enpower. Use them at your leisure. 
FYI - 
HERE IS A FINAL WORD ABOUT BLOOMBERG TRADES - WHEN YOU EXECUTE A TRADE ON BLOOMBERG, YOU MUST IDENTIFY ""BLOOMBERG"" AS THE BROKER IN ENPOWER. IF YOU FIND THIS MESSAGE UNCLEAR, MORALLY OPPOSING, OR IF YOU'D LIKE A LENGTHIER EXPLANATION OF WHY YOU HAVE TO DO THIS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW IMMEDIATELY. HERE'S WHAT YOUR BLOOMBERG DEALS SHOULD LOOK LIKE: 
A reminder from El Paso - Both Roger and Kathy need to receive the El Paso model via e-mail each day. Roger told me today that Kathy's been receiving it, but he hasn't. His e-mail address is rhawki1@epelectric.com Please let me know if you have questions. Kate 
FYI - We will NOT be confirming hourly trades for generators or any other counterparties until further notice. The logistics of the process are still being worked out. In the meantime, keep checking ""No Confirm"" on all deals. Bloomberg deals are another story. They do get confirmed everyday. However, the people in the Confirms group know this inherently and do not need the added validation of a ""Yes Confirm"" checkmark. What they do need is a clue as to which deals have been done with Bloomberg, and the best way to convey this is by typing ""Bloomberg"" next to the word ""Broker"" in your Deal Entry screen. If this is unclear, please let me know. Thanks, 
Real Time deals typically don't get confirmed; however, Chris Foster's generation customers have requested that we confirm their deals, whether day-ahead or hour-ahead. For us, this means we need to pay special attention to the box marked ""Confirmation"" when entering deals. I know you're all in the habit of marking ""No"" under this designation, so review the following counterparty names carefully and commit them to memory, because deals with these generators NEED TO BE CONFIRMED. Harbor Cogeneration Delano Energy Atlantic Richfield Co. Sierra Forest Products Wheelabrator Martell Wheelabrator Shasta Sierra Pacific Holding Co. Gas Recovery Systems East Bay MUD Attached is a list of these counterparty names and corresponding contact information. Feel free to print this out and keep it in a nearby notebook. Please let Chris or me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Kate

A final word on the new DMS procedure. Mike feels it's important you know that Volume Management will thoroughly research each discrepancy before bringing it to your attention. ""Make sure they understand that we will exhaust all of our efforts before we send it over to them. All notes will be provided on the DMS telling them where we are and what we found out and where they should look,"" says Purcell. So when the discrepancy shows up in your file, which you will check at the beginning of each shift, it is there because our back office professionals have hit an impasse and require your assistance to get through it. That means it's important. Thanks, 
Let's try something a little bit different regarding Real Time deal disputes.... When Virginia and Mike receive a dispute from Houston, they'll file the pertinent information in a drawer (marked DMS) to the right of my desk, in a folder with your name on it. Please consult this folder at the beginning of every shift to determine whether you have any trades to clear up and how many. Sometime over the course of your shift, take a minute to address the discrepancy, make strides to resolve it. If it happens to be more complicated than an ""intra-shift fix,"" talk to me so we can determine what needs to be done to expediate its resolution (pull tapes, pull our hair out, etc.) The most important step of this new procedure is post-op - TELL SOMEONE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. Sign the corresponding DMS sheet and write a legible explanation of measures taken on the back. Return it to Virginia, Mike, or me. Whatever you do, don't leave without a trace. I'd like to know if this sounds like a feasible plan; so feedback is welcome. In the meantime, this procedure will be effective immediately. Some of you already have disputes in your files.....Enjoy. Thanks, 
Please read the following carefully and retain this information for use whenever you trade on Bloomberg: 1. Bloomberg charges a $15 FLAT broker fee. 2. This fee applies whether you are the aggressor or receiver of a trade. 3. This fee applies each time you make a trade on Bloomberg i.e. $15 per hit or lift, regardless of volume 4. When you extend a Bloomberg deal in Deal Entry, account for each separate trade accordingly 	by adding $15 to any existing broker fee. ******	5. Because this fee is FLAT, select the ""FLAT"" button to the right of the broker fee. ***** 6. And most importantly, make a note in the ""BROKER"" box that the broker is in fact Bloomberg. I know that many of you were never notified of the Bloomberg fee structure, but going forward we should see every trade done on Bloomberg showing up in the system as having been done with Bloomberg. The Confirms group in Houston has compiled a weighty list of ""missing"" hourly trades since the advent of Real Time Bloomberg trading. I believe these are all in the system, but possibly short a broker name and fee. This, going forward, should no longer be a problem. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding Bloomberg trading and/or fees. Thanks, 
I will be out of the office Thursday and Friday, Oct. 25-26. Please leave a message, and I will be sure to get back to you on Monday. Thanks, 
We're lending again..... The STSW desk will be 20 mw short per the El Paso lending agreement, on peak @ 4C-345kv. The day-ahead sale price is $27.05. Please purchase to cover this position under the STWHOURLY desk and complete an inter-desk sale to STSW to tie out our positions. PLEASE NOTE: INTER-DESK SWAPS ARE NOT THE SAME AS ANNUITIES. YOU CANNOT NET THE DAY'S VOLUME AND SWAP OUT AT ONLY ONE HOUR. YOU MUST BUY AND SELL THE SAME AMOUNT EACH HOUR TO REMAIN AT ZERO EACH HOUR. It's been awhile since we've done this, so here's a reminder of the procedure. Once you've purchased to cover this short in the real time market, you must sell back to El Paso @ $0 to keep our position net zero. Then reduce the day-ahead purchase price from El Paso (794022) to $2 to cover the lending service fee. Please, please, please ask me if you have ANY questions about how to do this.

Here are the short positions our desk is taking for Wednesday, Aug. 8 - 1. EPE Lending: We're short under the STWBOM	book, 25 mw on peak @ PV. Price is $72. Reduce purchase price to $4 after procuring energy elsewhere and sell back to EPE @ $0. Deals are.... 721708 - STWBOM buys EPE 25 mw @ $72 721729 - STWBOM sells STSW 25 mw @ $72 721734 - STSW buys EPE 25 mw @ $72 2. Day-Ahead Short: We're short a total of 50 mw @ SP15 in the day-ahead market - 25 mw has been sold for $67.72 at SP15 by the STCA desk 25 mw has been sold for $72 at PV by the STSW desk. Make Real Time purchases to fill the short and sell back to the Imbalance @ $0. Deals are.... 721547 - STWBOM buys Cal-Imbalance SP15/On Peak 50 mw @ $0 721584 - STWBOM buys EPMI-CAL-POOL SP15 to PV/On Peak 25 mw @ $0 722024 - STWBOM sells STSW PV/On Peak 25 mw @ $72 Deal # TBA - STWBOM sells STCA SP15/On Peak 
Holden & Lisa - Per Holden, I've changed deal 630176 from a price of $170 to $197. Terms and reasons are as follows: 6/4/01 STSW buys EPE 49 mw/HLH The other side of this deal is a sale to El Paso for $204. Kathy questioned the invoice she received from Houston this month, because the breakdown of transmission costs and fees we had given her (regarding buy-resales done by your desk on 6/1, 6/2, and 6/4) amounted to a spread of $14.06. The deals we entered into our system, and subsequently billed El Paso for, amounted to spreads of $14.06 for 6/1, 	$11.06 for 6/2, and $34 for 6/4. To remedy this, and extend a gesture of apology for the mistake, we've changed our buy from El Paso on 	the 4th to a price of $197, leaving a spread of $7 to cover our transmission costs. I've explained this to Kathy at El Paso and Amy in Settlements, and wanted to give both of you a record of the change as well. Please let 	me know if you have any questions. Thanks, 
We'll be paying APS for line losses 7/11 at HE 7. I've entered two deals to cover this - a buy from El Paso (Deal #679653) and a sale to Arizona (Deal #679693). PLEASE ENTER A PRICE INTO THE BUY FROM EL PASO - 679653 - AND NOTE THAT PRICE IN THE EL PASO MODEL. LAST TIME WE PAID BACK LINE LOSSES THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. Let me know if you have questions. Thanks, 
In addition to the people you're already sending the EES sheet to, please copy Bill and myself when you send this out each day. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Kate 
Please disregard previous e-mails regarding the EES Mailing List. Instead of spending time typing out a lengthy distribution list, simply send the Real Time sheet to EES POWER SETTLEMENTS and it will reach all the relevant people. As always, let me know if you have questions. Thanks, 
BEWARE - Effective today, we will be taking over BOTH - not just the standard ONE - phone lines for El Paso during off peak hours and on weekends. This means we'll get calls that would previously have been directed to Roger and Steve's cell phones. All calls will still ring in on the EL PASO line. Please read the e-mail in Lotus Notes titled ""EPE MARKETING AVAILABILITY"" for details. And let me know if you have questions. Thanks, Kate 
I'm working with IT to get an EES mailing list set up so we can send the Real Time sheets to them each night with only the click of a button. In the meantime, they'll need you to click just a few more and send the sheet to..... EES Power Settlements Ainsley Gaddis Neil Bresnan Jubran Whalan Judy Dyer Michael Spruiell This is only temporary. Don't worry. Thanks, 
Please add Ainsley Gaddis to your EES mailing list. She needs to begin receving our daily EES trade log ASAP. Let me know if you have questions. Thanks, 
I've created a spreadsheet that will track Real Time BPA transmission reservations. I'll update the sheet each day to show total volume purchased and price at which it is purchased. I will also run a CARP report each day to ensure that the spreadsheet reflects Enpower exactly. Please feel free to give me suggestions if you'd like to see this added to or changed.

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress. Thanks for your patience, 
Whew! I've been battling with this thing all day and it's gotten me nowhere. The version of  EOL Deal Report I've been using for the past month, and which Carla used for several months prior to that, has come down with the winter blues and will no longer produce anything. Here is the error message it gives me: Cannot create file c:\eolJF.txt. It responds this way no matter what combination of requests I give it. One interesting detail is that it began doing this on 12/21, the night before I left for vacation (thus my delay in dealing with this problem), and on that same night I noticed that the report looked different than usual. Actually, it looked exactly like the stage version that Nadine and I worked with today. It had the new section at the bottom titled ""Uncheck 'Desk Summary Only' to enable""; whereas the version I had been using did not. Our IT guys deferred to you on this subject, so I'm still at a loss as to how to test the new stage version of the EOL report, as I have nothing to test it against. My feeling is that, even though the new version has a few quirks, it would be better than nothing and so should be put into production - because in the meantime I'm going to have to use it anyway - it's all I have now! Thank you so much for your support on this so far. Hopefully we can work something out tomorrow. Thanks, 
No. It looks like these are all the deals Christian Yoder and our other lawyers are working on. Christian is writing up confirms for these, and actually has a few of them done. He said he'd be contacting Sharen Cason and faxing her copies of the finished letters very soon. Please let me know if you need me to add comments to these deals to make it more clear. I'm going to talk further with Christian and Val Sabo on my end to better understand what the DEAL is with these deals, because they've been plaguing me all day. I'll keep you posted on the progress of this, but in the meantime you don't have to send revised confirms. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 01/02/2001 07:51 AM 
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! Hope you had a great holiday! These EES deals were all changed by Carla so they're all in ""Pending -Revised..."" status in the system.  It looks like Carla made some changes, but then changed it back.  Can you please ask her if we need to send revised confirms on any of these deals. 486972 486988 486992 486996 487005 487024 487042 487057 487060 Thanks for your help! Kim 
Chris Foster checked and couldn't find anything regarding these deals. His take on it was that if Stewart needed them confirmed, he would have passed the message along to someone else or left record of the deals numbers somewhere. In the meantime, he said, there isn't much we can do as Stewart is in Italy and is virtually impossible to reach. If I find anything else out I'll let you know. Thanks, Kate 
Looks like this has been changed - sorry it's taken so long for a reply! Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/22/2000 10:20 AM 
484809 kate, i talked to mike on this deal and it should be august.  i just want to let you know to make sure it gets changed. thanks and have a merry christmas! kerri 
I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right up. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   12/22/2000 08:36 AM

I've just spoken with Christian Yoder, who said he's got the confirmation letters for these deals on his desk. He's also planning to call you to discuss this further - these deals and several others entered as part of an EES acquisition will all be confirmed differently than usual. I'm not completely clear on the subject, so I'm going to defer to Christian's legal expertise. But if you have any other questions, please let me know. I can certainly sit down with Christian and maybe we can all conference call on the subject. Thanks, Kate 
I've changed the deal to be confirmed. Mike Driscoll changed this deal earlier, which must have affected the confirmation status. Thanks. Kate

Buy Duke 57.00 Cal-07 25 MW COB And if it's at all possible to get the traders names from the brokers when they have missing deals, that would be wonderful. I can usually guess by using the information given, but sometimes the traders get busy and aren't exactly happy about being bugged for missing deals that aren't theirs. I'm not sure how it works, but Carla told me the brokers should give you all the information at their disposal. If they don't, or won't, let me know and I'll have our traders talk to them.

My paycheck doesn't seem to be anywhere around here. Could you let me know if my name was on the list of missing paychecks for the end of last month? Kathy Axford said she gave you such a list on 12/30. Thanks, 
Bob Badeer informed me that these deals have already been confirmed, possibly by you. Could you let me know if this is in fact true? If it is, I will go ahead and make a note in the comments section of the deals. Thanks, Kate 
According to Bob Badeer, these deals were confirmed by Christian Yoder, on of our lawyers. I'll check with Christian to see why, and add comments to the deals to denote this. Let me know if there's anything else I can do. Thanks, Kate 
This deal is part of a sleeve - we bought Powerex at 145.00 and sold EES at 145.05. This is standard procedure for these kinds of deals, said the guys at the Long Term Northwest desk. They're positive that the deal should include a 5-cent charge on the sale side; and Mike Driscoll said if EES still disputes this, they can call him to verify. Please let me know if this deal continues to be a problem. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 01/03/2001 10:55 AM 
Thanks! The holidays for me were really nice.  All my brothers were home so they kept me pretty busy.  But it doesn't sound like it compares with yours!  Happy New Year! On another, not so exciting, note, I have another question about the EESI deal #481619.  I just spoke with Judy and they say that the price is supposed to be $145.00 not $145.05.  Can you check on that one?  It's the only one still hanging out there from the mess before the holidays. Kate Symes @ ECT                01/03/2001 12:34 PM 
Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are correct. Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 01/03/2001 06:51 AM 
Hi Kate, This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy. Thanks! Kim

Hi Kate, This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy. Thanks! Kim 
Chris entered this deal thinking that one was missing from a few days earlier. He then realized that the deal was already in, and zeroed this one out (instead of just killing it - sometimes those guys are in a big hurry!) So I'm going to go ahead and kill the deal, thus eliminating the need to change these other details. Does that make sense? Sorry for the confusion. By the way, how were the holidays for all of you gals down in Texas? I spent mine on the beach with a Pina Colada in Mexico, and believe it or not, I'm actually glad to be back at work. I was beginning to feel worthless, not to mention sunburned. Although any minute now I'm going to be ready for my noontime siesta! Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 01/03/2001 06:51 AM 
Hi Kate, This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy. Thanks! Kim 
I have read and understood your e-mail regarding protocol for e-mail and files during this time of investigation by the Attorney General. I intend to comply with all the policies outlined in it.  I apologize for the delay in my response; I was out of town for the holidays. 
I'm having Chris Foster check on these deals. Stewart is overseas for the holidays and won't be back for awhile, so in the meantime Chris and I will do our best to find out which deals he was referring to. Let me know if anything resembling these deals comes up on your end. Thanks, Kate 
This was Stan Cocke's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know. Thanks, Kate 
I spoke with Chris, and he said this deal is in the system. He didn't know the deal number off the top of his head, but he said Constellation is aware of it. Would you like me to research further? Or does everything look okay from your end now? Let me know. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/22/2000 11:46 AM 
hey kate, if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it. constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out also). my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care of by the time you return. thanks! 
I just spoke with Heather Dunton in Risk, and she said they've had problems valuing index forward deals that settle at the last 5-day NYMEX average. So to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date. In this case, the expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 586775. Each day Heather will take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 586775, and she'll average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day average. That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 586775 - doesn't need to be confirmed. Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's just split between two deals temporarily. Please call Heather or me with any questions. She's going to add another comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should be apparent to everyone that 586775 does not need to be confirmed at any point. When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value properly. Sorry for the winded explanation, but I thought it was better to give you more than less! Thanks, Kate 
I'm sorry my reply is so delayed - I was gone for the New Year holiday. This deal should have been entered on 12/19. It looks like it's still in there as 12/20; but I wanted to check with you before changing it. Let me know. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   12/22/2000 10:40 AM 
Kate- Mike Swerzbin deal 483771.01  we have trade date in system as 12/20/00 prebon sends confirm over with trade date 12/19/00. they cannot check into it again til Monday, there brokers are gone. maybe we can check on our sidein the meantime. thanks Stephanie 
While you guys were all busy worrying over the California energy crisis, I slipped down to Mexico to conduct an investigation of how our neighbors even further to the south are faring. Do they still have lights? Is the AC shot? Can they even make a blended margarita? Seriously, though, I will be out of the office on Friday, Dec. 22, and again from Wednesday, Dec. 27 to Monday, Jan. 2. I realize this is late notice; I did let Richter know awhile ago, but I probably should have spread the word a little further. I am truly sorry. At any rate (below the price cap of course), while I am gone I would be so appreciative if one of you could run the Dow Jones report in the morning and the EOL report in the evening. Dow Jones will only need to be taken care of from Wed. through Fri. of next week. I will call on those days, and I can easily explain the procedure over the phone to those of you who don't know it. If I call and you're ridiculously busy, just hang up on me. I'll call back later. The EOL report we have come to know and love is actually being fixed right now. I will talk with Nicolay Kraltchev, the Houston IT guy in charge of fixing it, on Friday, Dec. 22. It should be up and running again by Friday afternoon. Again, I'll call to check in and make sure this works, or explain how to use it. I'll be in the office on Monday, Dec. 25, just briefly to make sure it hasn't exploded in my absence, but then I'll be off to the land where tequila is better for you than water. Sounds terrible. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions, or problems, of the work sort, of course. Kate 
The EnPower IT group in Houston is making some changes to the EOL Report which in the long run will improve its functionality, but in the interim has left it temporarily disabled. I have left a message for Nicolay Kraltchev, the IT staff member in charge of the project, and he will be contacting both Carla Hoffman and me tomorrow. With any luck, this will be resolved by Friday evening and we can resume distribution of the report as usual. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this causes. Thanks, 
Broker is correct. Chris entered the wrong price. I'll change it to 370 when Risk is done calcing. Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/21/2000 01:35 PM 
483948 broker has 370.00 
Mark's got the price in for deal #484076 as $325. He's gone now, but I checked with Tom Alonso, who also trades on the Short Term Southwest desk, and he said it's definitely 325. Let me know if the broker still disputes this. As for 484077, it's in the system as $350 - is that correct? Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   12/21/2000 01:39 PM 
Kate, I called earlier to check out with Prebon, of course all the West guys were gone to checkout, I spoke to a broker on the NY desk. Please check the price of deal 484076.01 (Mark Fischer)   $325.00  (broker thought price looked like 330.00) 484077.01                                $350.00 Thanks Stephanie 
I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy, instead of Firm. I noticed that the one you asked about, #481620, was part of an EES sleeve, so I checked the other side of it, deal #481621, and sure enough it also had the incorrect energy type. It's holiday fever! Thanks, 
This deal, along with three other options I entered yesterday, defaulted to AM when I changed the expiry frequency from Day to Month. It's been changed now. Thanks for the heads up. Kate Stephanie Piwetz   12/21/2000 08:06 AM 
Kate- Can you please change the expiry strip to be 2:00 pm. thanks 
Apparently, these are deals we entered in an attempt to cancel an existing contract with Hinson - so they are not actual purchases of power, which I believe is where the confusion over the confirm letters began. Christian is working on the legal aspect of how best to confirm these ""deals,"" but as is so often the case with these guys (and especially around the holidays), they slipped out of the office before giving me an answer. So we'll get this done tomorrow morning. I'm sorry for the delay! Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 12/20/2000 07:30 AM 
Hi Kate, Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our ""New"" report every morning and I need to do something with them. Thanks for your help! Kim 
I've heard some mumbling about problems with EES deals, so this doesn't come as much of a surprise. Here's what I've done: On the first deal, #481619, I'd feel more comfortable if Mike Swerzbin, the trader who did the deal, gave his okay to change the price. I've left a message with him to verify the price, and at the very latest I'll see him tomorrow morning. Deal #480433 cannot be killed because it contains liquidated strips; however, it looks like Phil Platter, the Short Term California scheduler, has alreday zeroed out the deal. Will this work? Or is there another method by which I can go about killing a deal? (Sorry to ask so many questions, but 90% of our office is already gone for the holidays and quite difficult to get ahold of.) I've changed #481620. I think the trader just overcompensated for the change back from Daylight Savings Time. I'll remind these guys to always enter PPT for the time zone, to be on the safe side. I hope this solves at least some of the problems for now. I'll let you know as soon as I talk to Swerzbin tomorrow. Let me know if there's anything else. Kate 
I have changed the following deals to reflect a monthly expiry frequency instead of daily: 483753 483759 483765 483766 Since I don't enter options very often, and have only done daily options before, I'm still getting familiar with all the different parameters of the deals. I'm sorry for the confusion. Thanks for catching that. 
It looks like both of these are in with Pacificorp. Were they corrected? Kate Stephanie Piwetz   04/19/2001 02:41 PM 
586761.01   586762.01  should be Pacificorp. thanks 
sure thing! thanks for letting me know. kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/20/2000 02:48 PM 
kate, the tfs broker was supposed to call me back to check out, but i think he is already gone.  so i will check the deals out in the morning. kerri 
Thanks for keeping me up to date. Out of curiosity, do you know why El Paso changed the trade date in the first place? Kate Stephanie Piwetz   12/20/2000 01:45 PM 
Kate, just fyi, El Paso struck thru our 12/6/00 trade date and placed 12/5/00.  I spoke to Chi, of El Paso and he said the 12/6/00 was okay.  I just made a note on the confirm and sending it to the fileroom to be executed. Thanks Stephanie

I've forwarded this e-mail to Christian and Greg. Unfortunately, the population of the office is quickly dwindling as the holidays come near. I've been told that one or the other of them will be in today, and I'll find out if something has been sent out already, and if not, how soon we can do that. I'll get back to you as soon as I talk to them. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 12/20/2000 07:30 AM

Cara - that was adorable! Thanks for the memories. 
Would you let me know if confirmation letters have already been sent out for these deals? If not, is there any way to get them out before the holiday? Thanks, Kate

Val and I have finished auto-scheduling these deals. Please let me know if you see them coming through approval, or if there is anything else I can do to assist. Thanks, Kate 
Val, Please approve and autoschedule the following deals I've had to change to support the changes needed for Nevada Power transmission for October. Please forward to Joy when done. Les New Deal 477935, 477995 Changed Prices 425803,427001,430148,430175,430193,430860,458520,458498,458456,435403,435508,4 58604,436523,458762,440595,458772,458783,455667,443353,444346,444369,458813,44 6512,446512. 
The deal has been fixed. I'm so sorry about that - when I changed the dates at the top, the computer asked if I'd like it to copy the changes into the strips. I should have checked to make sure it did this correctly! And I will definitely add notes in the comments section of deals I change from now on. Thanks for the tip. Kate 
Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me know if this plan suits you - 1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible. 2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce a more accurate rendering of the day's activities. I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado. Kate 
These have been changed - and I changed the broker fee in 586569 to $15 flat. Stephanie Piwetz   04/19/2001 02:19 PM

You're so right. I've taken it out. I think that must have been a lapse in brain cells for one of the traders! Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/19/2000 11:18 AM 
kate, i don't think this deal should have a broker. kerri 
You're right - I'm changing the deal right now. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/19/2000 01:01 PM 
Mike Swerzbin deal 482593 Prebon shows term as Cal'02 instead of Cal'01 Thanks!! 
Les Rawson has spoken with Doug Reiner at Willamette regarding this deal. They are in agreement now about the prices. Les said he usually has to explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so it's nothing new. But in the future, Les said he'd prefer to contact the counterparty first to avoid confusion. His extension is 3924. You're also more than welcome to call me first and I'll track Les down. (I think I'm probably easier to get ahold of!) At any rate, I hope this clears it up. And if Willamette has any other questions, let me know. Thanks,

I've changed the term to 12/4, and I'm going to make a note in our daily deal correction report that this was due to a late report from EES. Thanks for catching this. Kate Stephanie Piwetz   12/19/2000 09:02 AM 
Kate, below is the EES spreadsheet that has the shows the powerex trade shown on 12/4/00.  Please verify and we can backdate the trade and reconfirm the document, or we can initial Powerex change and send back to them to show that we are in agreement.  Thanks Stephanie 
CHECK CAREFULLY ONE COB TRANSACTION IS NORTH TO SOUTH AND ONE IS SOUTH TO NORTH. 
This deal was a sleeve done for EES, and we've had problems with the trade dates on these before. EES reported this trade to us on 12/6/00, and it was Matt Motley's understanding that the trade was executed the previous day. He doesn't care either way, but he suggested you talk to someone at EES - maybe Jubran Whalan or Neil Bresnan - about what their intent was with the date. In the meantime, I can change the date to 12/4 if you'd like. What would be best? E-mail or call and let me know. Thanks a lot! Kate @ 503-464-7486 Stephanie Piwetz   12/19/2000 08:15 AM 
Kate- Please verify trade date for trade 474440.01, we received our executed Enron Confirmation Letter back from Powerex Corp and they struck thru our trade date of 12/4/00 and placed 12/5/00.  Matt Motley was trader, Jan 2001, $375.00, Cob N/S.  Please check and I will make note and send to Powerex.   Thank you. 
Thanks, Kerri - that's very nice of you! Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/18/2000 01:52 PM 
its okay, its not a big deal, i just wanted you to change it instead of me, just to be sure.  i am always usually in such a hurry when i talk to you. but, since it has slowed down a bit......i wanted to let you know you are doing a wonderful job, and you really are a pleasure to work with.  again i am sorry if it seems like i am always in a rush, just tell me to chill out. but, thanks for being so great.  i will pass that on to the traders when i get a chance! kerri Kate Symes @ ECT                12/18/2000 03:46 PM

Mike Swerzbin did not get a confirm from the broker on these deals. They were two sleeves done with EES, and Driscoll just entered them. Thanks for the heads up. Any other questions, just give me a call or e-mail. 
Sorry for the confusion, Geir. When I got the e-mail from Houston it gave me the deal numbers and your name - I didn't even look in the comments section. My fault! If you let Porter know the correct counterparty shortname, that would be great. Thanks for your help. Kate Geir Solberg 12/18/2000 07:36 AM 
Hey Just for the record I would like to make clear that I did not enter these deals. Our new trader  uses my tradee id when I work with him.( He writes entered by ......   in the comment section. I will point out the mistake to him so we can make sure it does not happen again. Geir 
This deal should have a broker fee. I'll change it in the system. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/15/2000 01:41 PM 
one more fee 478477 broker has .0075 
Two of these should have fees; two should not. Add .0075 broker fee to: 477212 Add .005 broker fee to: 474434 No broker fee on: 468440 468444 This is per Matt Motley's trade book. I'll change the fees in the deals; and if you have questions about the deals with no fee, let me know and I'll call Matt to verify. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/15/2000 12:55 PM

I talked to Diana Scholtes last night about this deal, and she looked at it this afternoon. She says the deal is definitely not entered correctly, but because it was done for the days when we got hit with transmission cuts, she wants to look into it a little further before she changes or kills it. She said she'd reconcile it tomorrow, and we'll let you know what we've done then. Thanks for your patience, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/13/2000 04:40 PM 
Hello, I think that deal # 476147 might should have been entered as a buy resale instead of as transmission.  There are not any other transmission deals in the system with this counterparty.  If you would not mind looking into this and letting me know I would appreciate it. Thanks! Melissa 3-1886 
P.S. I mentioned this to you, Melissa. But just a reminder that we need the default broker fee on this to be $.03. Thank you! 
Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if you need anymore information. Thanks, Kate 
This deal was entered today - Matt Motley was trying to agree on terms with the broker, but they didn't get it all tied up until this morning. The deal is as follows: Buy Calpine Palo Verde 25 MW Q3-01 $300 Broker: TFS Thanks, 
This is your missing deal for Jeff Richter: 480392 Buy Pac 12/17/00-12/18/00 50 MW NP-15 Broker: APB Thanks,

Rhonda did e-mail me about these deals last night. I forwarded it on to the Real Time manager and trader who entered the deals. It was actually a new real time guy using another trader's i.d. because he was waiting for his own - I don't think this is the kind of mistake the veterans should be making. At any rate, Bill changed the counterparty name and trader i.d. in all of these deals. Thanks for the heads up on this. Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/14/2000 06:11 AM 
Hello, Rhonda Denton may have already asked you about these deals.  She is out today.  The following deals are in under LADWPPX.  We think they should be Los Angeles Dept of Water and Power. 475790 476694 476701 476703 476713 479072 479076 479268 479335 Thanks! Melissa 
I think I sent something about this to you yesterday - here's a friendly reminder from Houston. Let me know if you guys want help changing these deals. Kate

I've forwarded this to Bill Williams III, Real Time manager, who asked to be notified of problems and discrepancies with Short Term West Hourly deals. I'll change these deals in the system; meanwhile, Bill's going to talk to Geir about using the correct counterparty name. Thanks for catching that. Kate Rhonda L Denton 12/13/2000 03:39 PM 
There are several deals in the system for this month under this CP name.  If this is supposed to be Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, please change these deals and let me know when they have been changed.  There have never been any deals under LADWPPX and I would like to inactivate if we are not going to use this record ofr the California PX.  Please research and let me know.

Correct again....This deal has been changed. Also, I've forwarded these last two e-mails to Bill Williams III, Real Time manager, who can talk to these guys about using correct counterparty names in deal entry. In the future if you see errors or discrepancies in deals done by the Short Term West Hourly desk, please send the e-mail to Bill and myself. This will hopefully be a more direct way of nipping the problem in the bud. Thanks for your help. Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/13/2000 05:04 PM 
Sorry to keep bugging you.  I think this deal is in as the wrong TransAlta. Thanks! Melissa 
You're so right! I checked around and found that Arizona Public Service still does the transmission deals for Pinnacle West. I'll change both deals right away. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/13/2000 04:56 PM 
Hello, I think the above deals should be in as Arizona Public Service since they are transmission deals.  Let me know what you find out. Thanks alot, Melissa 
I figured you'd probably see Geir before I do. If so, would you check with him on these deals and find out if they should be with LADWPPX or Los Angeles Department of Water and Power? I have a feeling it's the latter, but I'd like to know for sure before I change the deals and eliminate the useless counterparty name. Thanks, Kate 
There are several deals in the system for this month under this CP name.  If this is supposed to be Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, please change these deals and let me know when they have been changed.  There have never been any deals under LADWPPX and I would like to inactivate if we are not going to use this record ofr the California PX.  Please research and let me know. Deals 475790 476694 476701 476703 476713 479072 479076 479268 479335 
I checked both of these deals, and they each show no broker fee. Mark Fischer might have just changed this, but let me know if it's still not showing up in your system. Thanks, kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/13/2000 11:55 AM 
Mark Fischer- traded 12-12-00 deals 478539 and 478546 Amerex shows no fee on these deals and we show $.0075 Thanks!! 
These are done. Lester Rawson 04/19/2001 11:09 AM 
Kate, Please approve and autoschedule 3/31 Annuity 586477 3/31 Annuity 586498 3/31 Transmission 586421 Les 
That sounds great. Just let me know when you guys are ready to run the test upload. I can validate the deals and help work out any glitches, although it sounds like everything will go smoothly. Thanks for all your hard work on this - having the swaps automated will make my job much easier. Now you can kick back and relax before you make my job obsolete! 
I thought it might behoove you guys to know about this, even though I am unclear as to its meaning myself. Basically, Cara made a change in scheduling that she did not change in Enpower, and it has to do with an ongoing deal being managed by the short and long term northwest desks. In addition, Carla and I zeroed out a deal for Diana Scholtes in scheduling - 473338 - selling to Modesto at NP-15 for BOM on peak. For some reason, she just needed it zeroed out for tomorrow, so we did not change the deal in deal entry. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks, Kate 819-2181 
I show now two Smurfit Deals, 403522 for 25 flat, at 54.65,    and 246859.1 for 15  hlh, AND 25 hlh,   and 246859 for 15 llh AND 25 llh. I have zeroed out the 25's from 246859 in Scheduling, and we are flat now.  I did not change it in the deal because we were calcing, and I want to check with Diana first before doing it. What I show in Scheduling is a sale to Smurfit for 40 mw flat, which is what is actually scheduled 
If I don't drink anything, you get a ticket to the Blazers/Lakers game on Dec. 13. If I do drink, you pay for it. How's that sound? Kate Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Here are the people who handle confirms in Houston: Melissa Ann Murphy Sharen Cason Kim Hundl EB 3115 1400 Smith Street Houston, Texas 77002 Hope that helps! Let me know if you need anything else. 
This deal has been changed to AEP. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/12/2000 02:01 PM 
Matt Motley ref: 478877 Amerex shows cp as AEP not Sempra 
How many times will I have to remind them? Mike Driscoll added comments on both these deals - they would definitely like the special language added in the confirm letter. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 12/12/2000 02:01 PM 
Hi Kate! I have two deals that extent past April 2002 (Deal #478879 & #478878).  The traders didn't enter any comments about special CAISO language to be entered.  Will you ask them if they want us to enter that language? Thanks! Kim 
Per Greg Wolfe and Valarie Sabo: Do not verbally confirm these deals. Greg Wolfe is preparing a confirm letter himself. Sharen Cason was handling this account with Greg Wolfe, John Malowney and Valarie Sabo yesteday, so she would have more detailed information. Let me know if that does it! Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 12/12/2000 02:19 PM 
Hi Kate, We had a deal with Hinson Power Company, Inc. yesterday that we ended up not confirming because the comments said that it was a buy-back of part of a one-off deal and that Legal would prepare a special confirm.  There are no comments entered for these deals that would indicate that they are the same type of deal.  Are they?  Should we prepare a confirm letter? Thanks! Kim

The first two deals were already entered by Chris Mallory. Numbers are 478469 and 478477. I'll add APB as the broker on both those deals.

The strips in this deal have been changed. Total MW for the deal is now 24,800. If this solves the problem, great. If not, let me know. Thanks, 
Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if you need anymore information. Thanks, 
I've forwarded this message to Geier and Bill Williams III, the Real Time manager, who will remedy the problem - probably something to do with deal blotter defaults. Thanks. Kate 
478199 has been changed to 164.95 price. And 477087 has been changed to Q3-01. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/12/2000 07:56 AM 
has 478199 been changed yet? Kate Symes @ ECT                12/11/2000 04:39 PM 
Yes, these are deals 478198 and 478199. Both are entered under Natsource, and should be for Q1-01. 478199 was entered with the wrong price (165.05). It should be 164.95, and I'll change it when the Risk girls are done with their calc. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/11/2000 02:32 PM

I've changed 469388 to include a broker fee - trader mistake. Mike Driscoll and Swerzbin swear that the other two should not include broker fees. Driscoll just checked with the Natsource broker, who cleared this up with his back office - so they should agree now. Let me know if there is still a discrepancy. I believe the Natsource broker is changing this. Thanks, kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/11/2000 12:39 PM 
457489 .0075 459812  .0075 i talked to you about these trades a couple of weeks ago.  the backoffice of the broker got back to me on these deals and said there should be a fee.  can you pls talk to the trader on these deals. thanks also can you check on this one 469388, broker has .0075 
Contact name: Kevin Markovich Phone number: 406-496-5476 Kevin actually sent an e-mail to Melissa Ann Murphy regarding this deal, so if you need more information, she'd probably be the one to go to. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 12/11/2000 08:00 AM 
Hi Kate, I need to get a contact name and phone number for this counterparty so that I can get a verbal confirm on this deal.  Please see if John can give you this information.  Have a lovely day! Thanks! Kim 
These two are the same deal. We just added TFS in there as the broker - Mike forgot that. But we recognize the trade as Cal-01, not Q3-01. Mike just talked to the broker, who's going to pull the tapes from Friday to determine who's correct, but for now he wants to leave it as Cal-01. I'll let you know if we hear otherwise. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/11/2000 07:21 AM

If any issues with the scheduling sheet come up this weekend be sure to call me any time. 503.975.6747 
Don't worry about it. Actually, I kind of like to know what the schedulers are dealing with, as oftentimes in the thick of things they're too busy to explain to me why and how something I do affects them. It's all about the chain reaction in this place, I'm beginning to notice. Heaven forbid I was the weak link! 
Thanks for fixing that stuff, Stan. Do you need me to autoschedule the deals? Kate Stanley Cocke 04/19/2001 09:16 AM 
Audrey, Concerning deal #579038:  This was a mistake on my part, the price should in fact be $80 (as the APX is showing).  I've fixed the price in Enpower. Concerning deal #581335:  This trade did take place between Enron and Sierra Pacific Industries (not the APX).  I mistakenly put that deal in under the wrong counterparty.  I've fixed the counterparty in Enpower. I will ask Fran Chang to autoschedule both deals.  Let me know if I need to do anything further. Thanks, Stan Audrey Cook 04/19/2001 08:50 AM 
Kate & Stan, Deal #579038.1 Enron is showing $85 for the offpeak load on 4/13 & 4/14..... APX is showing $80 for offpeak on 4/13 & 4/14....please verify and correct if necessary.  I have also attached APX invoice per the internet website below for both days. Deal 581335.1 APX is currently not showing that this deal occurred for 4/16 for offpeak load (see screen  below at the bottom).  Please verify if this is some other c/p's deal.  Thanks. ajc Note: Please include Godfrey Hyde on your response since I will be out of the office on leave beginning Monday.  Thank you. 54 
I guess EVERYONE is going at a mad pace today, because we just checked with the Amerex broker, who said he's in the process of putting that second deal in - meanwhile his back office is trying to check out! What the...? So Amerex should see the second deal, identical to the first, any second. Let me know if they still don't check out. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/08/2000 12:28 PM 
Amerex shows this deal once and Mike Swerzbin shows it twice ref 477089 and 477088.  Can you check with Mike and see if this is a duplicate of not. trade date 12-8-00 Sell  Bonneville Power Administration  $700 MID COLUMBIA  1/1/01 - 1/31/01  25mw   onpeak  .0075 fee 
All of these deals are in the traders' books, and we're working right now on getting them in the system. Market is crazy, prices are insane, traders have been trapped in meetings all morning trying to get a handle on it. I'm sorry - we're hurrying. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/08/2000 12:14 PM

The broker put delivery point in wrong for a second and then changed it. It is Mid-C. Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/08/2000 12:19 PM 
ref 476900 Amerex shows delivery as Cob and we show Mid-C 
Thank you! The itemization was absolutely no problem, and please let me know when I can do things like that to make your job go more smoothly. I know the market got chaotic late yesterday; so I probably could have assumed that our net position would be off today and at least one other person would know that. But it seems that in this business, assumption can cause a small problem to breed and multiply into one of mammoth proportions down the line. So I thought I'd ask. In the future, is it you I should come to, or real time? Thanks again for your help. 
She didn't ""warn"" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails. But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better. I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know. Thanks a lot, 
It's done! Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 12/08/2000 06:51 AM 
Please go ahead and change it. -Thanks! Kate Symes @ ECT                12/07/2000 05:24 PM

This deal is in ""Pending - revised after sent to Ctrpty"" status.  Some changes have been made to the deal, but it still has an SP-15 delivery point with Firm Energy.  Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt. or the energy type that is wrong? Thanks for your help! Kim

I've auto-scheduled deals 566424 and 566426, and I'm including the Real Time spreadsheet for 4/9. The volumes I see in this sheet match the deals in our Scheduling system exactly (deal in question was 576512). Please let me know if this sheet is different than the one you were given, or if we've got another problem. And let me know if those first two deals show up on your CARP report. Thanks for your time on this, Kate 
Kate, Thanks for the update.  The changes you have made to deals 566424.1 and 566426.1 are not reflected on the carp report - maybe these need to be auto-scheduled??  As for 576512.1 I've added the hours in question to the spreadsheet.  If you need more clarification, please give me a call. Thanks Brooklyn 713.853.1909 
I wanted to introduce myself and let you know that the Portland West Desk has a new person in Deal Control. I'm sure you know from working with Carla Hoffman that the position requires quite a bit of communication with your group regarding Enpower program development; so if there is anything I can do to facilitate the speed or success of your tasks, please let me know. The first Enpower question I have is regarding the Enron Online Report. Apparently Carla had requested a few changes, which were then put into a stage version of the program. I'm wondering if we can get that report into production, and more importantly, if we can make a few more minor changes to it. Right now I'm running reports by logging on as Carla, which is fine, but eventually we'd like to see the EOL report up and running for everyone to use. I know that Carla and Nicolay have worked on it in the past, and I think it would be relevant to talk with them about issues and obstacles they found in the report. I look forward to meeting you (via telephone or otherwise!). Thanks, 
Bob says this deal is on SP-15. Let me know if Amerex still disputes. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/06/2000 03:02 PM

This is an index forward deal sold to EES by EPMI Short Term California - 80 MW, off-peak hours, on NP-15. I just spoke with Niclas, who confirmed this was the information he was looking for. If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to e-mail or call. Thanks, Kate West Desk Deal Control 503.464.7486 Carla Hoffman 12/06/2000 11:30 AM 
Hi Kate, This deal needs to be researched.  Can you help looking into its origin? Thanks, Carla 
I talked to Phil about a trade on  11/11/00  regarding 640 MW deal number 456233.1 could you please send me  and Jennifer Johnson some more detail about this deal. Is this an hour a head deal? What hours are involved? Thanks alot Niclas 
In regard to the special delivery point language for April-02 and beyond: Please use me as a liasion between the Portland traders and yourselves to ensure these deals get entered correctly. The traders are aware that they need to specify whether or not they'd like the counterparty to see this special language; however, if deals get through to the Confirms department without specification in the comments section, I'd like to be notified. In this way, we can resolve the matter quickly and efficiently and hopefully avoid a larger problem down the road. Thanks for your help on this.

I got a hold of Southern finally, and Mark Watts is out until Monday. The assistant who I spoke to knew pretty much nothing about this, so he said he couldn't verify whether or not they would be willing to ADP the deal. But according to our traders, they spoke with Mark Watts yesterday afternoon, and he agreed to ADP the December futures deal. If this still seems to be a problem, please let me know. Otherwise I'll plan on talking to Watts on Monday. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/06/2000 06:17 AM 
Hi Kate, the person at Southern that called Joe Hunter is Mark Watts.  His phone number is (678) 579-3470.  He may be a trader. Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks, Melissa (713) 853-1886 
Just FYI - this is the kind of stuff I think makes this job so interesting! 
You're welcome so much! 
Yes, Mike would like special language included in this deal's confirm letter. I spoke with him and a couple of the other traders, who said that they were aware of the change coming in April-02, but weren't aware they needed to enter comments in the deal. I'm sending an e-mail out to all of them to remind everyone to enter comments in deals that go past April-02 if they want special language. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 12/06/2000 07:13 AM 
This deal with Colorado River Commission is for calendar 2002.  We were told that we may need to enter special CAISO language for deals that extent past April 2002, but that the traders should be entering comments to indicate this.  Does Mike want us to include this language in the confirm letter for this deal? Thanks for your help! Kim 
BLOOMBERG 585337 - changed to APS I can't remember - did we decide to use APS as CTPY name with Bloomberg only until they change it to Pinnacle in their system? This won't mess up confirms later?

That's funny, because that's the guy who Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley told me agreed to ADP the deal. I just gave him a call, but no answer. I'll try back in a bit, but I think we should be fine considering Mark Watts supposedly already agreed. Thanks a lot, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/06/2000 06:17 AM

This is Mike Swerzbin's deal, Long Term Northwest desk, which he neglected to input before our risk group started calcing. It's in there now and the number is 474641. And Bob Badeer just entered his TFS deals, so you should see those in there now. Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/05/2000 02:49 PM

I've spoken with Tim Cannon at Sempra, who said that what he needed was for our broker and his broker to talk to each other and agree that this deal has gone physical and is no longer on NYMEX. Then I talked to Matt Motley, who talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully solve this once and for all. You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties. I would be happy to do that each month when we exercise our futures options, but I want everyone involved to be aware of the procedure. Thanks a lot for helping on this. Please let me know if you find out anymore. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/05/2000 06:45 AM 
Hello, I left a message for David Dupre and he has not called me back.  If you want to have Matt call Tim Cannon at Sempra that would be fine.  His phone number is (203) 355-5190.  I don't know why this has been so difficult.  If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he handled these deals in the past. Thanks, Melissa (713) 853-1886 Kate Symes                12/04/2000 06:31 PM 
Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him. Thanks, Kate 
Thanks for checking on this. Kate Stephanie Piwetz   12/05/2000 08:27 AM 
Yes, the following trade was cancelled, Bloomberg failed to send a cancellation.  Called Bloomberg, spoke to Trish, and she emailed me a cancelled copy.  Thanks Stephanie Melissa Ann Murphy 12/05/2000 08:46 AM 
According to all the guys at the Long Term Northwest desk, this trade was cancelled by Bloomberg. Let me know if Bloomberg still thinks it's good, and I'll have the traders call over there. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/04/2000 02:46 PM 
Hi Kate, I have a broker confirm from Bloomberg for the following deal: 
Dead deal. See previous e-mail. Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/05/2000 07:26 AM 
Prebon sent over another confirmation for this non-verbaled deal: Enron sells to Pacificorp Dec 6- Dec 31 25 Mw of Mid-C at $551.00 
These three deals, plus the one in the second e-mail you sent, are dead according to Chris Mallory. He said Prebon should not be confirming them. Please let me know if Prebon still disputes this. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/05/2000 07:17 AM 
Hi Kate, I have three deals so far that I did not verbal with prebon on yesterday and they sent over confirmations for them. Can you please check with Chris Mallory and see if these are good deals. Sell to PGET January PV 25 mw at $260.00 Buy from Aquila January PV 25 mw at $260.00 Buy from Edison Mission Dec 6- Dec 31 Mid-C 25 mw at $550.00

apb shows this deal should be with mieco. thanks 
How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December? Why is there a man parked outside my office incessantly tooting ""Jingle Bell Rock"" on his horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I began this e-mail with lines of whining? I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, but that's what makes everyday interesting. Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in (or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard. Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? Or ugly? Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd, and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season. Kate 
I realize this is late notice, but it just occurred to me that I never discussed my Christmas vacation plans with you when I transferred into Trading. I have a family trip planned and paid for, so I hope it won't cause too much chaos if I'm gone. I understand the tendency for people to feel lost and helpless without me. I'm supposed to be in California with my dad on Dec. 22, then in Mexico with my mom from Dec. 26 to Jan. 2. So I basically need to miss four days of work. Again, I'm sorry to bring this to you so late, and I'd be glad to do any amount of work before or after, or even spend my holiday entering deals on the computer in some exotic Central American internet cafe. I've heard they're great places to rage. We can discuss the logistics when you're back in the office. And by the way, the flame in this e-mail does not indicate anger, but rather is meant to be a festive, joyous, holiday-time explosion. 
Yes, it should have been Sierra Pacific Power Co. I've changed it in EnPower. These traders' heads are starting to spin with all the variations on counterparty names, as I'm sure yours is as well! Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton 04/18/2001 02:25 PM 
One more question, I promise.  Bob Badeer did this deal and entered it as Sierra Pacific Industries and I just changed it to Holding Company.  Should it have been Sierra Pacific Power Company because the delivery is Palo Verde and the Holding Co. deals are all SP15. 
Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him. Thanks, 
According to all the guys at the Long Term Northwest desk, this trade was cancelled by Bloomberg. Let me know if Bloomberg still thinks it's good, and I'll have the traders call over there. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 12/04/2000 02:46 PM 
Hi Kate, I have a broker confirm from Bloomberg for the following deal: 
The first deal is no good - Bob checked it out with Smitty at Prebon. The second two were Tim Belden deals. Following are the numbers: 473320 sells El Paso 25 MW 170.00 Mid-C Q2-01 473321 sells Grant County 25 MW 175.00 Mid-C Q2-01 Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/04/2000 02:31 PM 
I am missing the following deals per Prebon for Bob Badeer: Enron sells PGET 25 mw January Palo Verde at $260 Enron sells El Paso Q2 Mid-C at $170 Enron sells Grant County Q2 Mid-C at $175 
I've changed this to 50 MW - miscommunication between Puget and Richter. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/04/2000 01:24 PM 
On this deal for Chris Mallory prebon says it should be 50 mw and we show it as 25 mw. Can you please check with him.

Hello, I entered the TransCanada deal.  It is deal # 473100. Thanks, Melissa (713) 853-1886 
I actually did get that last e-mail, but somehow it ended up buried at the bottom of my in-box, just like so many other things. As far as the Blazer ticket trade, I believe I bought a call from you on the Laker game, and you bought the option from me on the Cavaliers - so I can choose to exercise on 12/13 at 7 p.m., and you can choose to exercise on 1/16 at 7 p.m. In other words, no matter what happens, I'm going to both games. Got it? As far as good stories from that night, I probably have the best, or at least one of the more hilarious, of those circulating the floor. And no, it has nothing to do with me. Ask me about it later, and I might be able to give it up for firm delivery of a seat at next week's game. Think about it. 
I don't know if you saw my second e-mail, but I checked it out with Chris Mallory, who did the deal, and he verified the price at $214.95. If Prebon still disputes this, let me know and I'll have Mallory talk to Prebon. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/04/2000 10:40 AM 
Kate Prebon shows $114.95 as the price and we show $214.95 Kate Symes @ ECT                12/04/2000 12:31 PM 
This is actually deal #471975, which I just fixed because Jeff forgot to put the broker name in there. It is with Prebon. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/04/2000 10:18 AM 
JEff Richter Prebon sent over a statement where: Enron buys from EES 12/5-12/30 25 mw of SP-15 at $114.95

471898 this deal is under prebon, should it be apb or does a separate deal need to be entered? thanks 
Oops, and one more thing. The price on this is entered both in Jeff's trade log and in Deal Entry as $214.95. I verified that with Chris Mallory, who's working on the California desk today. If Prebon still has a discrepancy, let me know. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/04/2000 10:18 AM

I've changed deals 581499 and 581605 to Sierra Pacific Power. They're suposed to be transmission deals, they were just in with the wrong counterparty name. And thanks again for working so hard to finalize this Sierra Pacific Holding Co. thing. Kate Rhonda L Denton 04/18/2001 01:39 PM 
Kate, I am changing the forwards to the HOlding Company.  There are 2 transmission deals with Sierra Pacific Industries that I think should be Buy/Resales.  We do not have transmission with either entity.  Can you check and see if the counterparty should be changed or they should be Buy/Resales? Thanks.

471977 was done with APB. I just changed it. 471975 was with Prebon. That's changed as well. These deals were both sleeves in which Jeff entered the broker name on one side but not the other. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/04/2000 10:18 AM 
2 deals that were input today for friday which one should be for apb? 471977 or 471975 both are under no broker.  i show one with apb. 
This has been changed - I guess old habits die hard, huh! Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/04/2000 10:07 AM 
deal  471553 should be under Pinnacle West Capital Corporation  not APS. Thanks!! 
These two deals are with APB, not Amerex. I've changed them in the system. Thanks for the heads up. Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/04/2000 07:47 AM 
Kate,  Can you check with Sean Crandall on these two deals because Sean with Amerex says he did not do these deals with them. Deal 471842 Sell Avista 12/5-12/31 Mid-C  50 mw at $310.00 Deal 471841 Buy Powerex 12/5-12/31 Mid-C 50 mw at $310.00 
Yeah - I pretty much became part of the furniture yesterday as I recouped from the brutality of that weekend. I ended up at a random friend's house at about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about 6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen 
Yes, this is correct. Les Rawson, our services guy, did this deal which he explained is a little strange because the company we're buying generation from didn't want to provide firm energy, so we're selling the unit contingent instead of firm to Avista. Anyway, that's how he tried to explain it to me. I hope that helps. Thanks, Kate P.S. Although the energy is correct in these deals, the days are not. I'll be changing 471884 and 471891 to reflect Mon. through Sat. on peak hours instead of M-S, Sundays and Holidays, on peak. 
All of Jeff's deals should be in. I spoke with Diana and she said she had entered these two deals. I'm looking for the deal numbers, but according to the trader, these are in the system. Let me know if you still can't find them. Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 12/01/2000 02:48 PM

This is a Tom Alonso deal; and it's for heavy load, and since 12/31 is a Sunday, the term will actually end on 12/30. I can change the end date in deal entry if that makes things less complicated; but either way the deal will end on the 30th. Please let me know. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 12/01/2000 08:19 AM

Hey there Mr. Real Time. Looks like you did a deal with Pacificorp on 11/28 - EPMI STCA buys 8 MW @ $60 for hour 2. These eight silly little megawatts have unbalanced our book and driven the schedulers to near insanity. No, just kidding. But I think there should be a sale of 8 MW from Nevada to Mead on hour 2 somewhere in there. I don't know - I'm not the expert, which is why I'm asking you. Will you please let Lisa Gang or me know how to fix this. I'm more than happy to do it, just wanted to double check with the man who created the mess in the first place. (Kidding again.) 
Melissa - I think we've finally reached a conclusion on the long term PX Index deals. I've entered the following comment in the six deals still in the system with Constellation at the old index: Constellation and EPMI have agreed to leave deal at PX Index. Counterparties' positions tie out - index price should not be relevant; however, index offset will. Per Bob Badeer, 4/18/01. KS This is exactly how Bob explained it to me, and he said it was exactly as Constellation understood it as well. So if this sounds good to you, I think we're set. If not, please let me know and we can make whatever changes are necessary. The deal numbers, for reference, are - 453152/453175/453294/462109/471888/471889 Thanks for your patience on this, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 04/17/2001 11:02 AM 
Hello, I guess if he wants to leave the deals as they are in the system then the accounting group will see zero for an index price and they will see the index off set price.  If he and Constellation both agree to do nothing to these trades (not to revise the confirms or change the index on the trades) then we can put notes in the trades explaining that.  I just want to make sure that Constellation agrees with however we handle this. Thanks for your help, Melissa Kate Symes                04/17/2001 12:28 PM 
I asked Bob about these this morning, and he said he's still got to work this out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at Constellation for him. Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed price? We'll fix this today - I promise. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 04/17/2001 08:12 AM 
Hello, any news on these Constellation Cal PX trades? Thanks, Melissa 
I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 03/29/2001 11:13 AM 
Hello, I hate to bug you with this.  Whenever you can spare a second would you ask Bob about this?  I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks. Thanks for your help! Melissa 
Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of these trades start flowing in July of this year. The deal numbers are as follows: 453152.01 453175.01 453294.01 462109.01 471888.01 471889.01 Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so I can send a letter for them to sign. Thanks, Melissa 
Well, the origination tickets are up for grabs if you want them. I have been informed by Mollie, Oh Holy Keeper of the Tickets, that you must, and I quote, ""come over here and beg me"" if you want to procure free seats to tonight's game. The ball is now in your court. I'd suggest driving down the middle, faking to the left, butt-kissing to the right, and taking it straight to the hole for a slam dunk. Good luck! 
Thanks so much for setting this up. I'm so excited! And I promise not to scare these poor kids away. 
Just FYI - This should cut down on the paper trail a bit. Kate 
Kate, I was not aware that it was being faxed.  I found out that T Jae Black on the East Trading desk was faxing it.  I went ahead and contacted her to let her know that there was not necessary.  You should receive an updated Credit Watchlist every Monday.  Please email me if you don't receive it. Thanks, Veronica Kate Symes                11/30/2000 09:23 AM 
I was just told that we are being sent the Credit Watchlist Update via fax, in addition to the one you send me via e-mail every couple weeks or so. Since I already receive and print out the list for all of our traders and mid-marketers, I thought it might cut down on some work for someone if they didn't have to fax it to us as well. I don't know if that person is you, or if you might know who I can contact; in any case, Iwe don't need the watchlist faxed to the Portland office. (Anything to take one extra step out of the day, right?) Please let me know if I should contact somebody else. Thanks so much, Kate

Is Bob still entering his deals? 
I just heard back from Holli Krebs, who verified that Puget is right on this deal - the term should be December through February. I've changed it in the system. Thanks, Kate 
Thanks - Enron designed that stationary specifically for me. What with my 
So, I got the scoop from Phil, and he says that YOU called him and told him the Riverside deal would be decreased to .55 from the usual .8 - go figure! Also, it looks like Jeremy just missed the .8 mw of generation in the 4/15 and 4/16 sheets, which in turn I did not include in your sheet. I've revised it and attached the spreadsheet, but please let me know if you have any other questions. Daniel Kang@EES 04/18/2001 06:47 AM 
Hey Kate, For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right? Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday (which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks. Dan

I'd like to introduce myself, as I'm sure we'll be in frequent contact in the coming weeks while I adjust to my new position at the Deal Control desk here in Portland. Please feel free to call or e-mail me with questions, concerns, alerts, or suggestions - I'm eager to learn as much as I can about this job and take it in new directions. So if there is anything I can do to make your jobs function more smoothly, let me know. As a first order of business, thank you for the heads-up on the new version of Deal Entry. A couple of our schedulers have been experiencing delayed efficiency with the program  today - I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the new version or possibly our Terminal Server connection. Just wanted to let you know, in case anyone else has the same experience. I look forward to working with you, and again, feel free to call me anytime. Thanks, Kate Symes 
RE: My newly formed case of dyslexia! I switched the MW hours on these deals. 469098 should have 10 MW with Sempra. 467455 should have 50 MW with SCEM. These are correct in the system now, but I just wanted to alert you to my error. Thanks, 
Here are the deal numbers, with correct counterparty names and MW hours. I changed deal 467455 and added one new forward: 467455 10 MW 175.00 Palo Verde Southern Company Energy Marketing 469098 50 MW 175.00 Palo Verde Sempra Energy Marketing Please let me know if there are anymore questions. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 11/29/2000 07:02 AM 
Hi Kate, Just checking on this deal.  Is this gonna be an exchange for physical and the counterparty name will be added later?  It's been ""new"" for a couple of days now, which is fine, I just wanted to make sure someone is working on it. Thanks, Kim 
I've got Mike Swerzbin checking on this deal. He says Holli Krebs actually did the deal, so he's trying to get a hold of her right now to verify the term. I'll let you know as soon as I find out. Thanks, Kate 
I'm sorry if I confused you with my e-mail last night, but I think I might finally have the futures figured out. Now, instead of one deal number with no counterparty name, we now have two deal numbers, two counterparties, and the correct number of MW in each. Imagine that! Here is the updated information: 467455 10 MW 175.00 Palo Verde Southern Company Energy Marketing Mark Watson 469098 50 MW 175.00 Palo Verde Sempra Energy Trading Chris Bennett I hope this makes more sense; please let me know if there's anything else I can do. Thanks,

This deal finally got sorted out this morning. I believe Kim Ward and Matt Motley worked out another deal with Deseret to offset their loss on this one. But 465821 stands as Enron had it - we sell to Deseret. If you have any other questions, please let me know. Thanks, 
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to track down this name and number, but I finally spoke with someone at Puget who said Suzanne McFadden is the person you need to talk to. Her number is 425-462-3844. If you need any other information, please don't hesitate to ask. ] Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 11/28/2000 07:41 AM 
Can you please get a contact name and phone number for this counterparty from Mike Swerzbin as soon as possible? -I need to get a verbal confirm on this deal so that we can send out the confirmation letter and the number we have in the system has been disconnected.  Also, we're checking on that other deal that I asked you about yesterday (I thought we confirmed it under the original deal # so I wasn't sure if we needed to confirm it again) Thanks! Kim 
Actually, no, there weren't any COB futures for December. Thanks for checking, though. Kate Cara Semperger 11/28/2000 04:35 PM 
there were no COB futures? Just checking , there normally are. c Kate Symes                11/28/2000 04:32 PM

Judy - I just heard from Kim Hundl in Confirms that you had a discrepancy regarding a Short Term West Hourly deal entered for 4/4/01. Deal 570892 was originally entered as a buy of 5 MW for hour ending 11. Then the trader extended the deal, which is something Real Time traders do often, but when they do they rarely modify the deal in EnPower Deal Entry. They simply make the change in Scheduling. Because of that, unfortunately, you can only see the true total volume of the deal in our scheduling system. At any rate, I've corrected the Real Time sheet for 4/4 to show the correct volumes for the correct hours; and I'm terribly sorry for the confusion. Please feel free to call me or e-mail any questions you have regarding EPMI's coverage of EES's load. I'm noticing that nine times out of ten, the discrepancies originate when Real Time is hurriedly sending spreadsheets to you guys and not making sure that they match the deals we have in EnPower. Also, I was wondering if you could tell me what database or report you're looking at to tie out our deals with your records. I think if I knew more about your perspective, I'd be able to help more efficiently. Attached is the revised Real Time spreadsheet for 4/4. And again, please call with questions. Thanks, Kate

You're right. This deal does not need to be confirmed again, says Monica Lande. I'll change it in the system as soon as our calc is done today - about 4:30 p.m. PST. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 11/27/2000 02:34 PM 
I think this deal should have been entered as ""no confirm.""  Can you please change it?  If I am wrong, please let me know. Thanks! Kim 
God, that's so nice of you to thank me. So many of my students just spread their little wings and fly away, forgetting that I MADE them goddamit. Anyway, I'm glad you had fun in Maui. I honestly think it's pretty much impossible not to. I'm getting ready to go back, hopefully at the end of this winter when I'm nice and frostbitten, in time to see the whales, which by then will be like my family as I will have spent the previous six months porking out on turkey and stuffing and washing it down with quarts of eggnog. If you're planning any more trips in the future, my full list of city guides can be accessed at www.katerockstheworld.com. It's a start-up operation, but I plan on retiring in about.....wait, hold on.....I just retired. See ya! 
Thanks for the in-depth information on our man of the hour, Ken Lay. I never could have imagined he was such a diverse guy - walks on the beach, stormy evenings by the fire, kittens, karaoke? Who knew! Do you think you could find out his star sign for me? Thanks,

1. 468359 is Mike Swerzbin's deal. He entered it incorrectly in his log. It's changed now. 2. 468404 and 468405 - Bob Badeer was given the wrong numbers by Amerex. He's changed the deals to reflect Amerex numbers. 3. 468302 is Donald Robinson's deal. I'm tracking him down right now to check on the term. 4. 468427 is $177, not $197. Jeff has really bad handwriting. I'll change this as soon as the calc is done (about 30 min.). 5. I've left Jeff a message - he's at an off-site meeting today and is probably giving a speech right now.l I don't see these deals in his trade log, so I really need to talk with him in order to find out whether or not he did them and where they might be.

did you even find out about deals 457489 and 459812? thanks Kate Symes @ ECT                11/22/2000 11:51 AM 
I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker fees of .0075. I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 11/22/2000 09:19 AM

Finally! This deal has been deciphered and changed. I killed legs 3 through 7, which were all inadvertantly entered as forwards instead of index forwards. I checked on the Dow Jones Palo Verde index price for those days - 10/3/00 through 10/7/00 - and verified that 5% was greater than $5.00. Legs 2 and 8 already reflected the 5% offset, not $5, so I didn't change anything on these. The new leg numbers are 420886.52 through 420886.56. If there are any further changes to be made, please let me know. Otherwise, thank you so much for your patience and cooperation. Kate 
Just wanted to keep you posted on this deal. You called me earlier and said that the counterparty, Deseret, had recorded this deal with Enron buying. We entered the deal with Enron selling. I have Matt Motley, Kim Ward, and Tim Belden reviewing the tapes of Kim Ward's conversation with Desret last week, in which it is clear that she was selling to Deseret. She's spoken with her contact there, who still disputes the deal and says we were buying. They're all talking it over right now, and I'll let you know as soon as we make a decisiion on whether or not to change this deal. Thanks for your patience, 
Just a heads up from Chris Foster - 
I've got Tim Belden checking on this. His first reaction was that it sould be confirmed. I'll let you know as soon as he gets back to me. Thanks, kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 11/27/2000 02:34 PM 
I think this deal should have been entered as ""no confirm.""  Can you please change it?  If I am wrong, please let me know. Thanks! Kim 
Mom - I know how if feels when things start building like that. I'm finding that ""alone time"" is really the only way to cope - especially during the holidays. But don't worry about getting upset - you have every right. I am really sorry that I haven't helped you with Anna's finances, but I've felt so overwhelmed just making it to and from work everyday that I haven't managed to fit in much more. Just when I think I might be getting on top of things, I do something like lose my glasses, which then takes priority over everything else I thought I would finally be able to do, as I cannot see a word I'm typing at the moment. IThe madness is neverending! I hope it's comforting to know that no one has it anymore together than you do. 
Dave - I'm the new Deal Control staff person here in the Portland office, and I've been told you're the person to contact regarding counterparty match-ups for our futures deals this month. The futures were done today, and if you could let me know of the corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out, that would be very helpful. If there is anything I should know about your job or how we might help each other work better, please let me know. Thanks a lot, Kate 
I've handed this over to Jeff Richter, who will speak with his contact at Aquila to sort this out. We were both confused about the discrepancy, however, because if the deal didn't exist there would have been problems in scheduling on Oct. 12; and so far we haven't heard anything. I'm sorry this didn't get taken care of more quickly, but Jeff was in a meeting this afternoon. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   11/27/2000 01:06 PM 
Kate, Aquila noted on our confirmation, that they DO NOT KNOW TRADE IN SYSTEM. Lisa Robinson (back office at Aquila) said she asked her trader and he does not know trade.

Sean Crandall just changed both of these deals. 464181 should have been a buy, and 464182 should have been a sale. Hope that checks out correctly - we couldn't find Diana Scholtes anywhere. Thanks, 
I see the deal showing a price of $119.76, which matches the sheet for 4/9. I'm sending you the sheet I'm looking at in case you don't have the latest version. Please let me know if you still don't see the correct price. Thanks, Kate Judy Dyer@EES 04/18/2001 10:37 AM

I will check with Prebon asap. Kate Symes @ ECT                05/02/2001 10:56 AM 
I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds! Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades as they are. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 05/02/2001 08:59 AM 
That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you double check with Bob for accuracy. Evelyn Kate Symes @ ECT                05/02/2001 10:43 AM 
Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need to have the same hours...... Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 05/02/2001 08:43 AM

Hello I am missing a Tom Alonso Deal Bloomberg bro confirm 11/20/00 Enron Buys IdahoPower Co Palo Verde Dec2000 25mws 125.00 on peak Thanks 
Wow! I bet you're sick of explaining that one to all the newcomers. That's about what I figured was going on - an overlap of names used by different members of the Enron family. Thanks so much for taking the time to respond and explain. And thanks for the welcome! 
Hi Rhonda - I was told you're the person to contact regarding changes in the Enpower counterparty list. Several items are outdated or have gone through many different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the traders and others who do deal entry. My sensitivity to this is heightened because I'm new to the Deal Control position here at the Portland West Desk, and I'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't. Monica Lande suggested I ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to stay in the system. I'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections. For example, Duke and El Paso both have five different names in the system; Arizona Public Service Company has become Pinnacle; and other names were just tests that are no longer used. Please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an urgent request, and I completely understand if the list needs to stay as is. Just checking. Thanks, Kate 
I'm so stoked you're going to Buena Vista Social Club. I can't believe you are such a rotten ""bik"" that you didn't invite me. What's up with that? My advice on the Outward Bound thing is to hold off. Not for selfish, wine-swilling reasons, of course; but because I know how tiring it gets to be living out of a suitcase with no dinero for a period of time. I have to say that sticking around Portland for the last six months has given me a renewed sense of mental health. Granted, I'm not totally sane yet, but at least I can imagine what it would be like. If you came home and turned right around and went to Colorado, you'd feel unprepared and maybe a little overwhelmed. Think carefully about how much Outward Bound would pay you in comparison with how much money you actually need to get by. Then add $500/month to that figure, and you'll be about right. It always sounds easier than the reality - I'm only speaking from Maui experience here. If you want to do a whirlwind Denver thing and have a great, rustic, totally broke time, then totally go for it. But if you feel like you're getting to the end of your rope with scraping by and feeling unsettled - which it kind of sounds like you are - then hang in P-town for awhile. Like I said, I'd feel SOOOO much better about taking off on my next adventure NOW than I would have even a couple months ago. And it's only been six months since I got back - that's not really too long to wait. In the meantime, you don't have to live with mom. The Malachowsky's room will be open, although for all the help I've given them I wouldn't be surprised if they don't want a Symes there anymore. Then there's always my future apartment. I'm thinkin' downtown for sure. Anyway, we'll talk more about it in Mexico. Don't stress - whatever you're meant to do, you'll end up doing whether you like it or not. Love, 
This deal is definitely on peak, says Matt Motley. It's a spread trade with Natsource, and both are logged in his book as on peak. Let me know if the broker still disputes this. Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 11/20/2000 01:11 PM

Bob Badeer changed the time zone in one of these deals - apparently that's what was throwing off the MW totals. So 458406 and 458405 should match now. Please let me know if there is anything else. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 11/15/2000 03:07 PM 
458406 i don't think this deal is entered correctly, the hours are not matching the other deals.  can you pls check on this deal thanks 
I think she'd do that. Her parents are out of town right now, so she's house/cat-sitting for them. I don't know when they get back, but let me check with her because it could get a little hectic if she had to be on the 
That sounds like a good one, mom. Like I've said before, I think it's a great idea and would be perfect for you. Now I think you should start taking steps to make it happen. I know you could get your house sold, no problem. And you should think seriously about putting it on the market soon, as I'm starting to get the feeling it can take quite a while to actually sell a house. Let me know how I can help - for example, Brian has some friends who rent out a great cottage in Kihei for $100 a week. He can also get really good deals on rental cars. If you start shopping around for a cheap ticket now, you could take a scouting trip this spring and make plans to move by the following winter - just in time for whale-watching. 
Well, I only went to the gym once last week, and then pretty much ate and slept all weekend, so I'm feeling like a pasty white blob of winter blubber. I'm just starting to get ""homesick"" for Maui, so Mexico will come not a minute too soon. Also, Molly and I went to see this movie last night, Requiem for a Dream. It was psychotic! It made me feel like moving to a farm and becoming a marathon-running vegan or something. Truly a horrible, horrible depiction of modern-day addictions and the messed-up way our society quells them. So, needless to say, I am MAKING myself go to the gym today. Anna's job opportunity sounds great, although I'm bummed we won't be roomies anytime soon. Maybe I'll get transferred to Enron's Colorado office. 
Mom - Thanks for the heads up. I am having the same nightmare with US Bank that I've had each time I've deposited any money: they won't let me have it! I've been meaning to e-mail Anna and let her know, but that's gone by the wayside along with pretty much everything else since I started this new job. I tried to close my account on Thursday in a last ditch effort to get at my money, and they politely told me I could close it on the same day I could get money out of the ATM, which will be on Wednesday. Until then my hands are tied. I'm really sorry about this - I know Anna needs help, and believe me, this isn't very convenient for me either. I'll e-mail her right now, and send her money on Wednesday. Give me a call later if you'd like to meet at the gym. 
Hey Kysa - I hope you're still at your computer. Amy's number is 464-7404. I'll try to call you in a minute and make sure you got this. And yes, dinner's still on, even though I'm feeling motivated to make toast or something equally effortless, so come without an appetite. (Just kidding - but I'm seriously open to suggestions.)

Hi Kate - I emailed Amy this morning.? I was going to give her a call today, would you mind c-lling me w/ her number.? Call my cell 503-706-5308.? Hope you are having a good day.? Is dinner still on tonight, 7:30pm?? Kysa Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com

Can you please change the bottom start/end date to reflect 11/21 - 11/30. The top start/end date shows 11/21 -  11/30 and the bottom shows 11/21 - 11/21. Thanks! 
I'm sorry - this was the first correction I received this morning and since it didn't come in the form of an e-mail, I unfortunately overlooked it when I was finalizing the deal error report. 
I'm taking over Carla Hoffman's position at the Deal Control desk in Portland, and I've got a request from Kim Ward to look into this deal entered incorrectly by our Short Term Southwest desk. Unfortunately, I need more information, such as the deal number and term, in order to make any changes to it. If you have this or know who does, please let me know and I'll be happy to make any necessary changes to this deal. My number in Portland is 503.464.7486. Thanks, Kate 
Please let me know if this format is accessible and useful for you. I know some of these deal changes aren't relevant to your calculation discrepancies, but I included everything just in case. If you'd like it pared down or beefed up, don't hesitate to ask. Thanks for your patience. 
Thanks for taking the initiative to get everyone together in the spirit of spending Andy and/or Gray's money. Things like this need to happen more often, in my opinion. 
I changed this deal, by the way. Please let me know if the broker thinks he's 
Mike has this deal in his trade log as 25 MW, but he said he'd go with the broker on this one and sell 50 MW to BPA. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 11/17/2000 02:55 PM

Here you go, Kim. I've added a couple more counterparty names to your list, and made a few minor changes that I thought might clarify the reasoning behind and origination of these ""no confirm"" deals. The one counterparty name I couldn't recall was Bonneville - do you remember who requested that we not confirm these? Please let me know if you have any questions on the additions. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 04/17/2001 02:43 PM 
Hi everyone! I have begun to document all special situations and counterparties that are exceptions to our ""not to be confirmed"" rules.  Thus, in the future, when we need to answer questions regarding why certain deals are unconfirmed, there will be no confusion about where the directives not to do so originated. Please review this document carefully.  Go ahead and make any changes that you'd like -but please change your font color so that I will know which items you have added.  I will incorporate all of your edits to the master document and save it to a common drive where it can be accessed and updated whenever necessary. 
This deal should be with APB, not Prebon. Trader error. I'll change this when the calc is over - in about 45 minutes. Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 11/17/2000 02:30 PM

Kate, When you get a minute (at 8:00 tonight?), would you, please show Theresa and I were the auction stuff is in Word?  I am going to have her call the vendors we haven't hear from (the majority of them) on Monday. Thanks! Mollie 
We just changed the deal - it was input correctly, but the computer did not change the time zones correctly. That's why we were off 25 MW. I'll let Duong Luu know of the problem. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 11/17/2000 12:39 PM 
i was talking about the total mws, they have 23,775, we have 23,800.  i think they entered the strips wrong.  can you pls check on that. thanks Kate Symes @ ECT                11/17/2000 02:17 PM

You rock, Angela! Don't worry, I'll be my usual quiet and unassuming self when I come by for lunch. Although, if you guys are having hotdogs, doesn't that mean that everyone pre-ordered? That would leave me ""sans hotdog,"" which would be tragic. Let me know. 
I think we ran into this problem before where the California schedulers, for whatever reason, didn't pull the .8 Riverside deal into their sheet, and therefore I didn't see it or add it to the EES sheet. Let me just check with Phil on this to make sure he didn't do it for a reason; then I can amend the sheet and re-send it. And on the Wed./Thurs. generation volumes - I can only assume that Phil spoke with Riverside at some point about the change to .55, but again I need to speak with him to verify this. He should be in the office soon, and I'll let you know as soon as I find out. Thanks, Kate Daniel Kang@EES 04/18/2001 06:47 AM 
Hey Kate, For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right? Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday (which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks. Dan 
Thanks for checking. I changed this deal to reflect off-peak hours only. Also, Tom Alonso just let me know that deal #460678 actually has a Mid-C delivery point, not Palo Verde. I changed this as well, but wanted to let you know so you can re-confirm. Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 11/17/2000 10:20 AM 
Hi Kate, I called Seattle City Light to verbally confirm this deal and they said that it should be Off Peak.  I spoke with Matt Motley who agreed.  Can you change this deal to Off-Peak hours?  If you want to check with Matt, that's fine. We're not supposed to make any changes to West deals otherwise I'd do it myself. Thanks! Kim 
Jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly. Here are the deal numbers. 461029 Williams 115.00 461030 EES 114.95 461801 Mieco 115.00 461802 EES 114.95 And Deal #461139 was actually a Short Term Southwest deal done by Tom Alonso with Williams for the same price on the same days, but with Prebon. Confusion! 
These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon - Sat. This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days. (This has since been fixed!) I've changed them in the system and was told to let you know so you can re-confirm the deals with just on-peak days. Sorry about the hassle. I promise I'll get the hang of this soon! Thanks, 
Mike has 25 MW with no broker fee in his trade log. I just spoke with him and he's going to call Natsource to confirm this. But this deal should be correct as it is in the system. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 11/17/2000 07:47 AM 
the broker has 23,775 as total mws, and also has a fee of .0075. 
I just talked with Mike, and he thinks this trade was made on the 14th, but possibly entered on the 15th and back-dated. He's coming in to the office in a few minutes and will call the broker to be sure. I'll let you know as soon as they've worked it out. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   11/17/2000 08:31 AM

I'm sorry for the delay on this, Tim. I've been in contact with Will Smith in Houston since yesterday to try to fix the problem of PX, Imbalance, and Tie Point deals uploading as Enron Online deals. Here are the correct statistics.

Sorry for the confusion, Sharen. I checked with the traders, and found that Deal #458391 does NOT need to be confirmed per Paul Choi in Mid-Marketing, who entered the deal with Valley Electric. Deal #457963 DOES need to be confirmed. It was a trader mistake. Thanks, Kate 
Thank you all for being so patient with me while I am under Carla's wise tutelage. Hopefully I'll be up to speed in the next few days, but if you notice me doing anything insanely wrong, don't hesitate to yell. One thing that has lagged slightly, but will be making a comeback tomorrow, is the Deal Correction Report. Every afternoon I'll check up on discrepancies noted by Houston and determine the source of the error. If the source of the error is you, me, the broker, or the computer gods, it will be noted in the error report and given to Risk Management to assist them in their daily calculation. Thanks again,

I'll try to contact Evelyn (who I think checks out with Prebon) to see if she's missing any deals. Let me know if APB gets back to you. Thanks, Kate Kerri Thompson@ENRON 11/14/2000 03:06 PM

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal #458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be changed, I'll follow up with those too. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   11/14/2000 02:16 PM 
Hello- Looks like alot of Mark Fischer's west deals are coming over as CAISO firm energy, for example deal 458255.01.  Please change, needs to be Frim Energy, we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter.  CAISO energy on NP 15, SP 15, and Zp 26 delivery points only. Thank you Stephanie 
Thanks, Laura. Today is the kind of day I need to be reminded of SOME reason 
Here's what I've come up with so far on these deals. There are just two more that are going to require a little bit more attention - 566426 and 566391 - the SP-15 deals for 4/2. I'm sorry it's taken me a few days to get back to you on this. Please let me know what you think, and we'll go from there. Thanks, Kate Trading Support 503-464-7486

Here are all of the deal numbers that correspond with today's tie point, Cal PX, and Cal Imbalance deals. I erased the EOL transaction numbers on the first four, but I believe they were going in a sequence beginning at 627. Thanks so much for your help on this. 458259 458260 64 65 66 Tie Points 67 69 70 458271 72 PX 73 458276 58 Imbalance 
Just FYI - The tie point and Cal PX deals we uploaded this morning did in fact load as Enron Online deals. Oh joy! I talked to Will Smith, who said he thought he'd heard this complaint before and very cordially agreed to take a look at it. I just thought I'd keep you informed of the latest episode in what I'm sure will be an award-winning series. (How about ""The Good, the Bad, and the Cal PX Bridge""?) 
Deal 456717 has been changed to reflect Pinnacle West Capital Corp, and the traders have been reminded of the name change. Chris Mallory said he entered the index deal selling to Calpine at about 2:15 PST today. The deal # is 457473. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 11/13/2000 03:00 PM

Thanks. I just checked Peoplefinder and all the new information is in there. One thing I couldn't change, however, was my department and supervisor. This may have to be changed by HR or my new supervisor; but at any rate, I now work in West Power Trading and report to Jeff Richter and Tim Belden. Thanks for your help. 
Both of these deals were broker errors.

I checked with Sean, who said he's finished entering his deals. Mike is just finishing up with his. Jeff Richter, however, still has about 8 deals to enter. This should be done within the next few minutes. Please let me know if these don't come through shortly. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 11/13/2000 02:19 PM 
I am missing alot of deals for Mike Swerzbinh and Sean Crandall.  Do you know if they are still entering deals? 
Thank you, Evelyn. I've back-dated Deal #456173 to 11/9. Let me know if there's anything else I can do. Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 11/13/2000 08:15 AM 
Sorry... the deal number to be backdated is 456173 
Can you please back date deal  to 11/09-00 I spoke with PGET and they recognize this deal as brokered through Prebon also.  I am still waiting for Prebon to claim the deal. Carla Hoffman@ECT 11/10/2000 03:08 PM 
Sean is entering the first deal as we speak. I will let you know as soon as we have a deal number. Sean said he is sure the second deal was done through Prebon. No one is there right now, but he will double-check with them. Again, I will let you know as soon as we confirm this. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 11/10/2000 01:06 PM 
ISSUE 1 Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal traded 11-9-00 where: Sean Crandall sells SCEM Dec'00 COB at $107.00 25 mw I did not confirm this deal with them and I don't see it in the system. ISSUE 2 Prebon is just now claiming  that they did not do this deal from 11/7/00. Can you please check Sean or Dianna book because I have it checked as verballed but now they are saying it is not there deal.: Enron (Sean Crandal) buys from PGET 25 mw of NP-15 for 11/10-11/30 at $95.00 
Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of this message. A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals on Friday. I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error message stating the following: 
No - I left all of that Christmas Party stuff at Theresa's desk when I first moved. If there ever was a business card, it would be there. Sorry! Kate Mollie Gustafson 04/17/2001 04:05 PM

Hi Stephanie - I just spoke with Diana about this deal and she indicated she had already cleared it up with you. Let me know if there's anything else. Thanks! Kate Stephanie Piwetz   11/08/2000 02:42 PM

Please join me in congratulating Kate on her new position at the Deal Control desk. She will make the change from Origination to Trading effective Wednesday, Nov. 8. We wish her success in the endeavor, even as we are beside ourselves at such a loss. Our new clerk, Theresa Villeggiante, will join the ranks on Thursday. In the meantime, please try to ween yourselves away from using Kate's services. Direct all requests and assignments to your respective Administrative Assistant.  This will help us keep track of tasks and complete them in a timely manner. Thanks for your help and congratulations, Kate! 
I've been working with Laura Wente to locate these documents for a couple days, and I think I've found what you need.

To all of you who are without the luxury of a dial tone this morning: Qwest Communications is working on the malfunctioning phone circuit. We don't know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented. Bell, Alexander Graham b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh d. Aug. 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Can. Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone (1876). For two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction, with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing through nearly 200 editions in English. Young Bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession. His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his 30th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training. Alexander (""Graham"" was not added until he was 11) was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell. Apart from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High School (from which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family trained and self-taught. His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in Elgin, County Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution. In 1864 he became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted his first studies in sound. Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through life--as a teacher-scientist. In 1868 he became his father's assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America. The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis, which had also struck down his younger brother, and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell. Concern for their only surviving son prompted the family's move to Canada in August 1870, where, after settling near Brantford, Ont., Bell's health rapidly improved. In 1871 Bell spent several weeks in Boston, lecturing and demonstrating the system of his father's Visible Speech, published in 1866, as a means of teaching speech to the deaf. Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips, tongue, and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way. Young A. Graham Bell, as he now preferred to be known, showed, using his father's system, that speech could be taught to the deaf. His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture. Even while vacationing at his parents' home Bell continued his experiments with sound. In 1872 he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf, edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer, and continued to study and tutor; in 1873 he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University. Never adept with his hands, Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson, a young repair mechanic and model maker, who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity. Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results. The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard, two deaf students whom he helped, were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits. Nevertheless, during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands. It is scarcely surprising that Bell's health again suffered. On April 6, 1875, he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph; but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop, while maintaining his daily professional schedule, Bell had to return to his parents' home in Canada to recuperate. In September 1875 he began to write the specifications for the telephone. On March 7, 1876, the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number 174,465 covering ""The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically . . . by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the 
As per your request, here are the names and addresses of people Laura Wente and I sent maps to today: Tim Carlberg Avista Corp. 1411 E. Mission P.O.

What better time to start thinking about the winter holidays than on Halloween?! Just a reminder that our happy little office will be hosting a Holiday Party & Benefit Auction on Saturday, Dec. 2, beginning at 6 p.m. and lasting until the wee hours of the morning. We hope that everyone will be able to attend, which is why we're reminding you while the smell of pumpkin-insides and candy corn is still fresh in the air. We will be holding a benefit raffle and auction again this year, and all proceeds will once again be matched by Enron Corp. Donations will be divided between Portland's Raphael House, a shelter for battered women and their children, and the Court-Appointed Special Advocates, a group that assists foster children and at-risk youth throughout the court process. But who said charity couldn't be a hoot? There will be a pangea of prizes and a gaggle of goods for everyone (think Blazer tickets and autographed Blazer basketballs!). And a BAND! A swing band! It will prove to be the most 
Here are the absolute, final, once-and-for-all-not-to-be-changed-again vendor letters. 
Thought it would be a good idea for you to have a copy of this. 
Yes - I was also going to mention that I talked with Christian Yoder about this, and he confirmed that the counterparty name in the contract is The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Port of Oakland board, and on and on and on. So we'll be using that name, NOT the Port of Oakland, when doing deals with this counterparty. And out of curiosity, does anyone you know of trade with simply the Port of Oakland? Thanks for following up, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   04/17/2001 03:26 PM 
all looks good, I verballed the deal with Wing, as The City Of Oakland.....thanks sp Kate Symes                04/17/2001 03:22 PM 
I've changed the counterparty name to The City of Oakland - and the contact is Wing Lau. His number is (510) 627-1457. According to Stewart Rosman, the middle marketer who did this deal, City of Oakland is the same entity as Port of Oakland; however, City is the counterparty name in the system which is linked with the correct contact info. I tried to look up the contract in Livelink, but I keep getting an error message. Is there any way you can check on this contract to make sure we're entering these deals with the correct counterparty name? Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   04/17/2001 01:17 PM 
Please ask Bob for a contact, if you place it in the comment section we can add it. Port Of Oakland Thank you 
After researching the position further, I am very much interested in formally applying to work in Deal Control. I have spoken with Jeff Richter, Val Sabo, and Carla Hoffman about the requirements and responsibilities of the job, and I have a good understanding of the kind of candidate they're looking for. I feel I fit that profile and am excited by the challenge it presents. I have also spoken with Mollie Gustafson and Chris Calger, who have given me their support in pursuing another opportunity within the company. (Although they would be understandably heartbroken.) Please let me know at your earliest convenience how to proceed in applying for this position. Thank you for your help, Amy. 
You didn't know that? It's actually Mary Katherine Symes. My parents decided that Katherine Mary didn't sound ""Catholic"" enough; but they still wanted a daughter named Katie, so they went right ahead and called me that from the day I was born. Needless to say, it's added an unnecessary element of confusion to my life in that people are always wondering who the hell this ""Mary Symes"" person is. Thanks for noticing, though!

NOTE FROM THE EDITORS The AmeriFlash Newsletter would like to keep you informed on global wholesa= le=20 news as well, so we have added business highlights from Enron's original=20 electronic newsletter, GlobalFlash, which was created by Enron Europe. 
Just in case you're checking your e-mail in between spa sessions, here's an update: The BPA Business Plan has not yet arrived. Sir Speedy just arrived with copies of the EIS, which were supposed to be finished at noon. So I'm a little frustrated with this lack of efficiency. I've left a message at BPA regarding the whereabouts of our order; I've scolded Sir Speedy for the delay; and one way or another I'll get the documents out to Terrell Gault and Jim Fell tomorrow. I'm sure the last thing you want to hear while you're escaping from it all is that things aren't going according to planned back in the office; but I thought you should know just in case you hear from either of these guys. Nothing to worry about, though. You can now resume your poolside position. 
Whatever she's making now is not enough. Vickie Aldous went above and beyond the call of duty, not only locating, copying and expediting the article to me, but all within two days of my request. And it was for a good cause - we'll be donating the proceeds from our holiday party/auction to the Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Last year the proceeds went to Emanuel Children's Hospital - $20,000 from auction attendees plus matching dollars from Enron Corp. resulted in a hefty check. I'm sorry we didn't connect while you were in Portland. I got the message on Monday and figured it was a little too late by then. Hope the reunion went well. I'm scrambling to be svelte and successful by my 10-year high school reunion, which descends upon me in less than four years. I know I'll need at least that much time, having spent four years of my life with that bunch of overachieving Catholic girls. I just had a surprise visit from some Ashland friends on Tuesday, replete with an extra ticket to see Santana at the Rose Garden. What an awesome concert! I must say I'm thoroughly enjoying city life again. But I'll need to come to Ashland soon for a dose of good old-fashioned familiarity. So, I guess this was the long way of saying yes, I got the article, and thank you so much for such indispensible help. 
I'm dragging myself out of this office. I can hardly keep my eyes open, but it's well-deserved. Santana concert last night with friends from Ashland. The social schedule just never lets up. I don't know how feasible it would be for me to spend two months resisting the temptations of hand-holding boys and shadowy bars. But I will think seriously about the idea. Have a safe trip back home. Oh, and my Christmas plans still stand - gone from Dec. 22 to Jan. 2. Maybe it's you who needs a schedule rearrangement. 
I have just a couple questions about your expense report. Let's go over it whenever you get a chance. 
I would be very interested in finding out more about the Deal Control position and what it entails. Coming from a background in print journalism leaves me somewhat at a loss for practical experience; however, I make up for skills in my ability to learn quickly and work aggresively. I'll come by sometime today to talk further about this opportunity. Thanks for the notice. 
Please join me in welcoming Angela Cadena and Mike Danielson to Enron North America. Angela has joined West Origination as a senior specialist.

She is most proud of her latest project - a 15-month-old baby girl named Maxim. Mike has been with Enron for more than two years in East Origination and Enron Online. He will be based in San Francisco as a Director for West Origination. Mike hails from Florida and comes to us most recently from Houston. Please introduce yourself and make him feel at home on his frequent Portland visits. 
You'll be staying at the beautiful Phoenix Inn in sunny Eugene this Wednesday evening. You can check in at anytime, but if you need to cancel, let me know before 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Your confirmation number is 251832, and the reservation is under Todd Perry (to assist in the check-in process). If you have any other questions, let me know or call the Phoenix Inn at 541.344.0001. And have a pleasant stay. 
I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds! Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades as they are. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 05/02/2001 08:59 AM 
That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you double check with Bob for accuracy. Evelyn Kate Symes @ ECT                05/02/2001 10:43 AM 
Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need to have the same hours...... Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 05/02/2001 08:43 AM 
sorry it is 598739 Kate Symes @ ECT                05/02/2001 10:25 AM 
598736 and 598737 have been changed to off-peak hours. But I can't pull up 306927. Is this the right deal number? Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 05/02/2001 08:03 AM 
Bob Badeer deal 306927 Prebon shows as off-peak hours....enpower has peak hrs Bob Badeer deal 598737 Prebon shows as off-peak hours....enpower has peak hrs Bob Badeer deal 598736 Prebon shows as off-peak hours....enpower has peak hrs 
Both deals have been changed to reflect a flat $15 fee. And thanks so much for following up with the IT request for a default change in EnPower. Just let me know when you hear back. Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 04/17/2001 03:24 PM 
deal 582589 and 582423 Can you please adjust the fees to reflect $15.00 flat.  FYI please select flat instead per mw in the field to the right of currency field. Thanks 
That is the commission for those trades. The rate that Bloomberg Powermatch now charges for cash trades is $15 per trade. 
You're booked in Mt. Bachelor from 9:30 to 11 a.m. on Tuesday. I'll swing by Starbucks in the morning and pick up a variety of bagels and cream cheese for six people. We'll get a pot of coffee in there and you should be set. Let me know if there's anything else I can do. 
I took a message from Pat Brown at Avista this morning. She needed to book one more spa reservation for Jean Gonnella. The only time Jean can do it is between 3:30 and 6 p.m. on the Thursday they arrive. She would like a deep cleansing facial and a french manicure. If there isn't time for both, she'd just like the facial. Please call Pat and confirm the reservation time when you make it. Her number is 509.495.8123. Thanks! P.S. I don't want you to think I'm passing the buck. I would have taken care of this myself, but Mollie said you had a bunch more reservations to make on Tuesday morning. Good luck, and let me know if you need help. 
I know I already discussed time off at Christmas with you, but I have really indecisive parents who are divorced and like to do completely opposite things for the holidays, so I have one modification to make. If I could take off from Friday, Dec. 22, to Tuesday, Jan 2, then I can accomodate both of my parents and head off a potentially disastrous fight over which kids go with which parents. It ends up being two more days off than I had asked for before -  the 22nd and the 2nd. I'm really sorry to ask for so much time off, but I wouldn't do it unless my life were going to be in jeopardy if I didn't. Thank you!

I have re-scheduled your conference call for Thursday, Oct. 20, from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. Dial-in number: 1-888-476-3762 Host code: 652393 Participant code: 234986 Should you have any questions, don't hesitate to call me at 503-464-3748. 
I've ordered the 1999 Annual Report for Scottish Power, as I noticed it was not in the company file. It should be here tomorrow or Friday at the latest. If you need the information sooner than that, I can download the report from the company's website, although the document is understandably bulky. Please let me know if you'd like a print-out. Also, if you'd like, I can talk to Sue about CASA's financial needs. Mollie and I had discussed splitting the auction proceeds between two charities; in that way we can share the wealth and not inundate an organization with more than they can manage. It's something to think about in case CASA doesn't need much help.

In reviewing Jeff Shields' expenses for the previous two months, I have found two travel itineraries which came without prices on them. Jessica and Mollie have both checked their e-mail and confirmed that the only documents sent did not detail the cost of the trip. The prices I need are from the following trips: Itinerary only - August 28, Alaska Airlines, PDX-SeaTac-Helena-SeaTac-PDX, Reservation # AS/WXOKNK (reservation made August 24) Itinerary only - Sept. 6 to 7, Delta Airlines, PDX-Salt Lake City-Spokane-PDX, Reservation # DL/V2KIC3 (reservation made September 6) Thank you so much for your time.

Here's the latest version. Sound better? 
Have fun with these! 
This is the last e-mail I received from Laura. Looks like she forgot the attachment the first time. 
I think I found what you're looking for: www.ferc.fed.us Once you get to the home page, click on the ""gas"" icon. From there, hit the link to the ""FERC Gas Tariffs Page."" Then it gives you a choice of viewing the tariffs in HTML or saving them to a different file. I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to review this information. The website is updated every 30 days, or so it said, so you may just want to keep it bookmarked and check it out whenever you need the information.

Here's a rough version. I think I included everything you mentioned. Let me know if you think anything needs to be added. 
Have fun with this! 
Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt. Bachelor conference room for your Monday morning staff meetings, 9 to 10:15 a.m., from now until this time next year. Hopefully this will eliminate any last minute confusion like what we ran into this morning. If you have any other questions, please let Mollie or myself know and we'll address them as quickly as possible. Thank you - Kate Symes 
I don't know if this is at all what you were looking for. Jessica's version will probably work better. 
I notified Jim Fell and Terrell Gault of the delay in getting the documents to them, and Jim actually said he had both the Business Plan and the EIS and therefore didn't need either. Hopefully the Business Plan will arrive from BPA today and I'll send it off to Terrell. Also, I'm sorry about the errors on the place cards. I was in a hurry to get them out to Sir Not-So-Speedy and overlooked those details. I hope it didn't cause too much confusion.

Here's the correspondence between Evelyn in the Houston Confirms group and Paul Callahan at Bloomberg outlining the broker's new $15-per-trade fee. Please let me know if you have questions or would like me to talk to someone at Bloomberg about this. I'll also check with Tim to find out if the fee change was ever negotiated with Enron. Thanks, Kate 
Kate for our deal 582589 and 582423 these deals according to Bloomberg the fee should be $15.00.  Please pass on to Mark and Tom. Thanks! 
I've changed the counterparty name to The City of Oakland - and the contact is Wing Lau. His number is (510) 627-1457. According to Stewart Rosman, the middle marketer who did this deal, City of Oakland is the same entity as Port of Oakland; however, City is the counterparty name in the system which is linked with the correct contact info. I tried to look up the contract in Livelink, but I keep getting an error message. Is there any way you can check on this contract to make sure we're entering these deals with the correct counterparty name? Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   04/17/2001 01:17 PM 
Please ask Bob for a contact, if you place it in the comment section we can add it. Port Of Oakland Thank you 
It's been changed to Avista. Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 04/17/2001 12:44 PM

Tom and Mark are not spot traders, they're cash traders. This is what I was referring to yesterday - that Real Time is now being charged $15 for trades - but cash and term traders should still be charged the traditional $.005. Why is Bloomberg recognizing these trades as Real Time? Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 04/17/2001 12:33 PM 
Hi Kate, per our discussion on yesterday about the $15.00 flat fee on Tom's and Mark's deals, here is Bloomberg's response.  Please pass this info to all of our traders.  Please let me know what the response is from them. Thanks 
Evelyn, as of April 16, 2001 our charge for Spot trades is a flat fee of $15/trade. 
Thanks for doing that. And those deals didn't show up in my query because I was looking for trades done under the Short Term West Services desk - I didn't realize Chris was also entering these under Short Term California. Just let me know if there's anything else I can do. Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton 04/17/2001 11:20 AM 
What about 573679, 579822, 579826 and the 2 transmission deals that are in Enpower?  I will change them as soon as Sam gets the CP set up if its okay with you.  Then I can tell Kim Hundle to resend the confirms. Kate Symes                04/17/2001 11:34 AM 
Thanks for following up on this, Rhonda. I believe you just spoke with Chris about the executed original of this contract. Please let me know what else I can do to speed this process along. I ran a search for deals the West Services desk has done with this counterparty (which were entered with Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc.) and came up with only three deal numbers. They are: 580832 580137 580136 Would you like me to change these over? Or are you doing that along with the re-confirmation? Please let me know when you get a chance. Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton 04/17/2001 09:19 AM 
Because of credit reasons, the name above will remain the name under the contract.  Global Counterparty has agreed to set up this dba as listed on the contract.  Once this CP has been set up, I will need the trades moved to this CP and the deals will need to be reconfirmed in the accurate name. If there are no objections, I will move the deals and instruct the confirm person to resend the confirms.  I will also move the contract to this new name.  Genia will prepare the amendment covering just the change in the credit provisions. If Portland holds the fully executed original, please forward to me at your earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or further instructions, please contact me at X35871. 
Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need to have the same hours...... Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly. Thanks, Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 05/02/2001 08:43 AM 
sorry it is 598739 Kate Symes @ ECT                05/02/2001 10:25 AM

Here you go, Chris. Please ignore the last four days, as they are still under construction. And let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Kate 
I asked Bob about these this morning, and he said he's still got to work this out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at Constellation for him. Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed price? We'll fix this today - I promise. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 04/17/2001 08:12 AM 
Hello, any news on these Constellation Cal PX trades? Thanks, Melissa 
I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 03/29/2001 11:13 AM 
Hello, I hate to bug you with this.  Whenever you can spare a second would you ask Bob about this?  I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks. Thanks for your help! Melissa 
Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of these trades start flowing in July of this year. The deal numbers are as follows: 453152.01 453175.01 453294.01 462109.01 471888.01 471889.01 Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so I can send a letter for them to sign. Thanks, Melissa

This deal was a physical payback to WAPA, and it should be in at a zero price. I've added a comment into the deal to explain this, and I asked Holden to put comments in any weird deals he enters from now on. Thanks for catching this - it does need to be confirmed. Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 04/17/2001 09:05 AM 
This deal has no price entered -should we not confirm it?  or is it wrong? Thanks! Kim 
I'm not sure why you're seeing a price of $65.70 come through on this deal, but I'm looking at the deal in EnPower right now and I see a price of $65. If you could let me know what report is showing the incorrect price, I might be able to figure out why. Thanks, Kate Judy Dyer@EES 04/17/2001 08:16 AM 
Your deal # 581358.1 is showing a price of 65.70 but on the Real Time spreadsheet, I see 65.00.  Which is correct? Thanks for you help Judy 
I just spoke with Sean and he said he was indifferent on the subject - so you guys can go ahead and confirm these deals. I'm looking into why Puget sales seem to be coming up ""no confirm."" Thanks for checking, though. Kate 
Mark - I'm so sorry I haven't responded yet, but yes, I did get your e-mail. I actually solved most of the issues detailed on the spreadsheet, but wanted to finish before I sent the document back. I've attached the spreadsheet with what I've done so far, and I'm forwarding most of the remaining deals to Bill Williams in Real Time. The two deals with volume discrepancies are going to take some looking into - I think they're in the system correctly and it's probably just an error in my spreadsheet - but I'll let you know. Again, sorry for the delay. Thanks, Kate Mark Confer 04/17/2001 05:50 AM 
Kate did you receive my e-mail from the weekend for EES April activity?   I know you may not had time to look at them, I just want to make sure the e-mail got to you since it was the weekend when I forwarded it to you. Thanks, Mark

I've never seen anything but a .005 broker fee on Bloomberg deals. Tom Alonso wanted to know when that fee changed.......we're confused! And the Matt-Bob deal swap - I guess it was just a last minute decision on their part, and they should have let the broker know. Matt said the trade needs to stay in Bob's book, and just to check it out as a good trade with EPMI. Let me know if you still have problems with this.

I can't seem to pull up 598391 - is that the correct deal number? Kate 
This is a Real Time deal, and that desk enters deals a bit differently than I do. When they initially do a deal, they enter it for a certain hour or set of hours. Then, if they agree with a counterparty to extend the deal to flow through more hours, they change the deal in Scheduling, not EnPower. The way to see the true volume of a Short Term West Hourly deal is to look in the ""View Actuals"" tab. If you look at this deal, you'll see that they extended the initial 5 MW at HE 11 to look like this: HE 11 - 5 MW HE 12 - 5 MW HE 13 - 5 MW HE 14 - 4 MW HE 15 - 4 MW HE 16 - 4 MW HE 17 - 5 MW +__________ 32 MW Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Here's the latest I've heard from EES regarding ways in which we've managed to thoroughly confuse them. I'm researching most of these questions, but as with last month, there are a few Real Time deals they don't see in the spreadsheet you guys send to them. Would you mind checking this out when you have a minute (or despite the fact that you don't)? If you revise anything, just let me know or e-mail it directly to Mark Confer and Brooklyn Couch. Thanks, Kate 
Kate, I looked over the list below and 90% of them look easy, just a few updates to the schedule or real time sheets and April activities will be well on the way. Please let me know what you think, If I can help from this end I will be glad to. Thanks, Mark

I've gone ahead and entered the counterparty name ""Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc."" in Chris Foster's deal #573679, in the interest of moving it along through the confirmation process. (The deal was done on 4/6 and flowed on 4/10.) I spoke with Bob Ellery (Sierra) yesterday and he seemed fine with the name we have in our system, although I'm sure he's not the final authority. Then I spoke with the Confirms group today and they were ready to get the deal off of their new deal report. So, since I haven't heard anything to the contrary, I changed the deal from it's ""new counterparty"" status. Please let me know if this presents a problem for any of you. Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support

I'm just going to leave this deal with ""New Counterparty"" for the time being. I had changed it to Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc., but it sounds like there may be a problem with this name. Please let me know what I can do to help this along, or give me a call when a decision is reached. Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton 04/12/2001 11:48 AM 
Sam, Please contact this CP (info on Kate's previous email) or find the dba information online with D&B or Lexis Nexis so that we can get the true lowdown on this name.  I don't think we should take the trader's information as gospel, for as you know, they are not always accurate.  Please let me know as soon as you get this information.  Thanks. 
Looks like we might have to modify this name in EnPower after all - The dba on our master agreement is ""Sierra Pacific Industries"" with no ""Inc."" at the end. I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that, although the company is a corporation, they never use ""Inc."" in their contracts. Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master agreement because of those three pesky letters. Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you. In case you'd like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 - it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April. Thanks again for all your help.

Bob Badeer just entered the Cal-02 deal under Long Term California desk. Deal # is 580382. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   04/12/2001 12:29 PM 
Kate, just a heads up, I called to verbal a trade with Riverside and he mentioned there was another one for Cal 02, we verballed 579012.01 for Q1 02. Do not see other in system. Thanks Stephanie 
Thanks for checking on that, Rhonda - I'll make a mental note of it. Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 04/12/2001 01:34 PM 
According to Rhonda we never use BP Amoco however, she thinks the Calgary office does. Thanks Kate Symes @ ECT                04/12/2001 03:13 PM 
I've changed this to BP Energy - and I was wondering - didn't BP Amoco change over to BP Energy? Do we ever trade with the old counterparty name anymore? Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 04/12/2001 12:29 PM 
Cara Semperger deal 580011 CP name should be BP Energy not BP Amoco. Thanks

Okay - I've changed 578812 to Sierra Pacific Power Co. I asked Bill about this and he said he didn't realize the counterparty was in with Sierra Pacific Industries and not Sierra Pacific Power. The Real Time guys pay as little attention as possible to counterparty names, unfortunately. Thanks for catching this, Kate Rhonda L Denton 04/12/2001 10:41 AM 
When we do not have a transmission contract with an entity, we usually do a buy/resale to cover the transmission over their system. Kate Symes                04/12/2001 11:17 AM 
P.S. I'll ask Bill Williams about Geir's transmission deal. Can I ask, though, why it looks like it should be a buy-resale? Kate Rhonda L Denton 04/12/2001 09:03 AM 
When the contract is fully executed, just forward it to me in interoffice mail.  I do have questions about the name that the contract has been written under and the name that the deals are under in Enpower.  Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. is in global counterparty and the deals have been changed in Enpower to this CP.  The problem is that the contract and the confirms will not agree as to who is the correct CP.  We have always confirmed deals under the name of the entity with whom we have a contract.  Please let me know if the name will be changed on the contract to reflect the correct CP or will we amend the contract to add ""Inc."" to the end of the name and set up this dba in global counterparty.  I need to know before we can confirm these deals. In additiona, Geir has entered a transmission deal for this CP.  578812. Should this be a buy/resale? Kate Symes                04/12/2001 10:35 AM 
I sent a copy of the agreement to Melissa Murphy via fax. I'll need to get ahold of Chris Foster, who is in your Houston office at the moment, to locate the original.

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa.

Just let me know how I can help. We've already entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner we can change that the better. Thanks, Kate 
I've added a comment in each leg of 597246 - ""Deal modified from three separate index-forwards to one deal with three legs."" Does that work? And I'm checking with John Malowney now to see if the confirm you've already sent out will suffice - he's in a meeting right now. I'll get back to you in a moment. Thanks, Kate

Okay - I can forward the contract along on Monday when Chris Foster gets back. Also, I think I'd like Chris and his contact at Sierra to talk over the issue of whether we'll amend the contract to include ""Inc."" or whether we'll amend the counterparty name in EnPower. I've left a message for Chris regarding this question, and hopefully we'll touch base sometime today. I will let you know as soon as I hear back.

Yes - I've been working with Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty and Melissa Murphy. The new name has been entered into the system, and deal # 573679 has been changed from New Counterparty to Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. (That's the name Sierra Pacific Holding Co. is doing business as.) Thanks for checking in on this, though. Kate Rhonda L Denton 04/12/2001 07:08 AM 
I have been out of the office.  Has anyone responded to you on this? Kate Symes                04/09/2001 02:06 PM 
Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!) Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
Yes, the correct name does include ""Inc."" at the end. And yes, Steve Hall said the master agreement works for this trade. He and Bob Ellery at Sierra talked over the agreement and decided to use the name that Sierra Pacific Holding Co. is doing business under. I've changed the deal (573679) in EnPower. Please let me know if you turn up any more questions. Thanks, Kate Melissa Ann Murphy 04/12/2001 06:52 AM 
Hello, Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. is a choice in Enpower.  Is this the correct name with the ""Inc."" on it?  I am assuming that Steve Hall said it is OK to use the master agreement for this trade. Thanks, Melissa Kate Symes                04/11/2001 07:38 PM 
Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. - Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list in EnPower.

It was great to run into you, too. This shrinking world never ceases to amaze me......to end up working in the same building, different industry, over a year later? Crazy. So, on lunch or a beer after work, just let me know the time and place. Lunch is a rarity with me, but I love to have an excuse to breathe fresh air in the middle of the day. And I need to plan ahead as well. I'll keep the week of the 22nd open - sound good? Talk to you soon. Kate John Enders <jenders@ap.org> on 04/11/2001 08:59:19 AM 
Kate: It was great to run into you. I'm glad you've found something interesting to do in Portland. I'm up to my ass organizing the state AP broadcasters convention at Sunriver the weekend of the 21st. After that, lets plan to have lunch, or maybe a beer after work. As I said, I come in early and leave at about 3:30 each day. Lunches are possible, but I need to plan ahead. Again, good to see ya. John

Okay! Real Time has finally drilled down on the problem we were having with deal 564094 (STCA buys from EES/HE 9-22 @ $160) and corrected the Real Time sheet to reflect our price. I apologize for the delay in finding the source of the problem, and as it turns out it was just a matter of someone putting the wrong price in the sheet they sent you. Very frustrating, I know, but I've attached the correct sheet nonetheless. Please call or e-mail with questions, and I'm sure I'll hear from you soon! Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486 
Thanks for following up on this, Melissa. I've forwarded your e-mail on to Chris Foster and asked him to discuss the counterparty name with Bob Ellery, his contact at Sierra Pacific Holding Co.

Hello, Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty called this company and he was told that they should be set up in our system as Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc.  The contract has the long name on it so I am planning on asking Rhonda Denton about this tomorrow when she comes in.  I am not sure if it will work this way or not.  If you know anything else about this let me know.  Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. is in Enpower but I am not certain if we should use that name. I will let you know what Rhonda says tomorrow.

Chris - Here's the latest I've heard on our request for a new counterparty name (Sierra Pacific Holding Co.) to be added to EnPower. I faxed the master agreement to Melissa Murphy so the Confirms group could reference it; then she passed the pertinent information along to Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty, whose job it is to set up new counterparties. But it looks like your contact at Sierra is saying this deal should be done with Sierra Pacific Industries - the parent company - rather than Sierra Pacific Holding Co. Do you have a preference either way? Maybe you could contact Bob Ellery and discuss this. Just let me know which name to add to the deal. Thanks, Kate 503-464-7486

I spoke with Chris, and he called Alicia who said she still believes the deal should be for April, not May. Chris said they are in a dispute at this point, because he believes the term should be May. So he asked me to leave the deals alone for the moment, and he will be in touch later today. Would you like me to make a note of this in the comments sections of the deals? Kate Stephanie Piwetz   04/11/2001 07:55 AM 
Kate, I called Alicia Izarraraz from Atlantic to verbal trades and she was inquiring about the term of trade, May delivery, she thought they were going to be for April delivery. Deals 576274.01, 576275.01.  Kate, can you ask Chris to call regarding inquiry.  Her cell phone is 949-637-4878, her desk number 562-499-3201 she said she will be out if the office soon.

Here's the latest - The Short Term West Services desk bought power from Sierra Pacific Holding Co. for 4/29 and 4/30. Then, Bob Ellery, our contact there, called the Real Time desk and said they had lost a unit and needed to buy some of the power back from us. The deals are in our system as follows: 594854 EPMI buys Sierra Pac. NP-15 4/29 - 45 mw round-the-clock 4/30 - 40 mw round-the-clock $218 off peak $328 on peak 595714 Short Term West Hourly sells Automated Power Exchange (Sierra's scheduling coordinator) NP-15 4/29 - 19 mw round-the-clock $228 (Total Value = $103,968) Because Sierra's buy-back was in the Real Time market, we sold to their SC, not Sierra itself. Also, confirm letters don't go out on hour-ahead trades, which could be why you're running into some confusion. Let me know if this helps, and I'll continue to look for a deal flowing on 4/30. The Real Time group told me there was one, but it's only for the first 6 hours, not the whole day. I'll get back to you soon. Kate Mark Confer 05/02/2001 07:20 AM 
Kate, what is the latest regarding Sierra Pacific Industries and the buy backs for the 29th & 30th in the amount of $103,968 for each day?  Let me know if I can obtain more information for you.  The payment terms are net 5 days after receipt of invoice, which they faxed to me on April 30th. Again, thanks for all your help regarding this and all the EES items. Mark 
Chris - Looks like these deals might have been entered for the wrong term. I'll check with Jeff on this, but if you recognize that the terms are wrong, please let me know and I can fix them. Here are the deals: 576274 STCA buys ARCO SP-15 May-01 On Peak 15 MW @ $260 576275 STCA buys ARCO SP-15 May-01 Off Peak 15 MW @ $135 Thanks for checking on this. Kate

To re-cap: I've changed three Short Term West Hourly deals to reflect what all parties have agreed to - EPMI sells to Sierra Pacific Holding Co., HE 23-24 on 4/28, HE 1-24 on 4/29, and HE 1-6 on 4/30. Instead of selling to the Automated Power Exchange, we'll be using them as the broker, paying a $.03 per MW fee, and selling to Sierra Pacific. Following are the changed deal numbers, for reference: 595705 595714 595819 I believe this should clear up any discrepancies we had among different counterparties' invoices. Now all we have to do is cross our fingers....no, just kidding. Please let me know if you have questions, or if problems arise from these changes. Thank you, 
Here's the path to the California prices sheet: P:Trading/California/CAScheduling/Cash/Position/CA/2001/feb2001/Cal Prices 
Broker is right - I've changed the deals to Allegheny Energy Supply Co. Thanks, Kate 
Hey - Are you guys boycotting CAISO energy? Kate 
All these have been changed to CAISO firm energy, and deal 576511 has been changed to Reliant Energy Services. Thanks for catching these. I'm forwarding this e-mail on to the Real Time group (again) as a reminder. Thanks, Kate

I've modified these deals to read as follows: 572069 West Services buys from APX NP-15 On Peak - 12 MW @ $245 for flow 4/6-4/7 Off Peak - 12 MW @ $150 for flow 4/7 TOTAL MWH = 480 576468 West Services buys from APX NP-15 Off Peak - 12 MW @ $140 for flow 4/6 TOTAL MWH = 96 Please let me know if this is correct. (I hope!) And don't hesitate to call me with questions or other deal corrections. I will be running between two different desks today, so if you can't reach me at my regular extension (503-464-7486), I can be reached at 503-464-3823. Thanks, Kate 
Deal has been changed to The City of Oakland, a municipal corp., and contact info has been added. Kate 
I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to Idaho in the hour-ahead market. Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   04/02/2001 12:00 PM

I spoke with Paul Choi, the mid-marketer who did this deal, and he said the deal should be with The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation, not Port of Oakland. Also, the contact is still Wing Lau @ 510-627-1457. I'll change it when Risk is done with the calc. Thanks, Kate 
How in the hell do you get out of work at 3:45? Well, you've inspired me - I'm going to haul ass home and maybe make it there by 6 pm - whoo-hoooooo! But seriously, call me tonight if you get a chance. If not, I'll try you (if I can dig up your home number somewhere) or call when you get into town this weekend. I'll be around, so we HAVE to hang out at least once. 'Kay? Or I'll just stalk you. 'Kay? Take care. Love, 
I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of three separate deals. So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter. Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it right away. Thanks for your help on this, Kate

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa.

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name Chris Foster has requested: Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries Address: PO Box 496028 Redding, CA 96049 Or: 19759 Riverside Ave. Anderson, CA 96007 Phone: (530) 378-8179 Fax: (530) 378-8139 Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already entered Chris's deal into the system with ""New Counterparty,"" so the sooner we can change that the better. Thanks, Kate

Joanie! I have been soooo busy lately and I'm starting to feel like I sold my soul to the Enron devil. In fact, I have no time to be writing this e-mail right now, but I've been meaning to drop a line and catch up with you. I also just ran into Brigdet (from the class below us at SMA) at lunch - apparently she's married to some baseball player. Crazy! So right away I had to contact my ever-realistic ""single"" friend to bring me some sanity. I'm actually dating a guy right now, but it still gives me the chills to hear about anyone near my age walking down the toilet...I mean aisle. Anyway, call me, or I'll call you tonight - let's dish! I hope everything's great with you - I expect nothing less. I have lots of interesting stories to tell about how and why I've come to the decision that I'm sending my roommates to rehab. Love, Kate 503-464-7486 (work) 503-288-6546 (home)

I've added the fee - these are supposed to default when traders enter the deals in Enpower, but for some reason Bloomberg fees aren't coming through lately. I'm checking with IT on this. Thanks, Kate PS - I'll add you to the Deal Correction Report mail list starting today. Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 04/09/2001 12:59 PM 
deal 574356 Jeff Richter Kate Bloomberg shows a fee of .005 on this deal and we show no fee. Thanks 
This is an index forward, so for round-the-clock deals we enter more than one in order to have peak and off-peak hours settle against the different index prices. 596722 is the off-peak part of this deal, and 596723 is the on-peak part. Let me know if this makes any sense. Thanks, Kate 
Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!) Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 
Here you go! 
Both have been changed to CAISO energy. 
I've changed both deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Tom said the guy who calls him from this counterparty each day says he's from Florida Power & Light - so he's going to ask him next time which counterparty he'd like us to specify in the deal. Also, I changed 570450 to a price of $80. Thanks, Kate

Hello, Sierra Pacific Power Company called me and they don't recognize this trade.  Could it possibly be with another counterparty? Thanks, Melissa (713) 853-1886 
This deal discrepancy seems to have a few of us stumped - so I'm referring it to all of you in hopes that we can solve this today. Following are the terms of the deal: Short Term California buys Enron Energy Services Hours: HE 6-9 Delivery Point: SP-15 Term: 3/29/01 Price: $110 The deal was entered by Bert Meyers, a Real Time trader, on behalf of STCA. It was extended for HE 9 through 22 at a price of $160. In the spreadsheet Real Time sends to EES each day, it shows the deal as a sale at a price of $130, not a buy at a price of $160.  My first instinct was to simply modify the spreadsheet to match the deal in Enpower, but EES claims they see the price coming across as $130. I'm reluctant to send any more incorrect information to EES, as we've already dealt with enough confusion over this matter. Please take a look at the deal and its corresponding documents, and let me know which is the correct price. Thanks for your help,

Evelyn - Here's the status of those year-long deals I changed last night. Everything should look good now - 571920 now has 25 mwh and 571801 is killed. Let me know if you still see something wrong. Thanks, Kate 
This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no value for either of the deals. I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks, Kate

This is what amerex is showing and this is what I have confirmed. Kate Symes @ ECT                04/05/2001 04:59 PM 
Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May? Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 04/05/2001 03:03 PM 
Amerex is showing a deal on their checkout I did not verbal Enron buys from Aquila Sept. 01 PV 25 mw peak hrs at $292.50

Thanks for the clarification (Mike was a little off!) - we've killed 571801 and restored 571920. Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 04/05/2001 02:42 PM 
571801 is the deal that is not good.  It is for Cal'02. 571920 for Cal'03 is a good deal and it was verbaled Kate Symes @ ECT                04/05/2001 04:29 PM

I'm just sending the sheets that are saved in our system. Bill Williams told me he cleared everything up on the Real Time side yesterday, but if the volumes in these documents still look wrong, please let me know. Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 
You are such a renewable energy stud! I'm excited to see you and Elliot transform the way the world thinks of POWER. K 
This deal has been autoscheduled and should show up with correct on peak volumes on the new CARP report. 
Thanks for letting me know about the change in this deal. I looked at the audit viewer, and it jogged my memory a bit. Mike originally entered this deal as Q2 off peak; then he came over to me the next day and said it should have been Cal'03-Cal'04. So we changed it, and it must have messed up the strips somehow. Anyway, if it checks out with the broker, that sounds good enough for me. Thanks again, 
Thanks so much, Willie! 
I just talked to Chris about this. Apparently, the Reliant trader thought he was clicking an SP-15 trade, and called immediately afterward to ask Chris if it could be adjusted. It was more lucrative for Chris to do this deal at SP-15 than NP-15 anyway, so he agreed. I guess I'm unclear about the exact EOL guidelines in a situation like this, but please let me know if there's anyone you'd like me to talk to. Chris didn't have the trader's name offhand, but I could probably get him to research it a bit more. Just let me know what you need from us. Thanks, Kate 
I've added the third leg to deal 566375 and changed comments in each leg to reflect that. We had a bit of confusion about who was actually adding the new pub code, but it's in the system now and the deal is ready to be confirmed. Just a note - I previously had all the Sunday and Holiday hours in the off-peak leg of this deal (so Risk could calc the value correctly), and now I've deleted those strips to account for leg 3 which contains only Sunday and Holiday hours. Please let me know if anything looks different, other than that, on your end. Thanks, 
Just a reminder - We have added a new pub code to EnPower. The code is for the Dow Jones COB Sunday Index. Please advise that the Portland West Desk has one deal in the system at this time against that index, and more may follow. Thanks for your help with entering these prices. 
I sent an e-mail to Les Rawson about these deals yesterday, but - oops! - he's not in the office. I just had Stan Cocke enter the unit names in them, so you should see the following in the comments section - 568866 - unit name is Willamett Industries Albany Paper Mill 568864 - unit name is Grays Harbor Paper Mill 568860 - unit name is Las Vegas Cogeneration Facility Thanks, Kate Kimberly Hundl@ENRON 04/05/2001 07:51 AM

I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet. It should reflect the latest volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing between EES and EPMI. Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an attempt to feed them through to the CARP report. Please let me know if you see the changes come through, Mark. The autoscheduled deals are: 533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01 535419 - 3/2/01 535420 - 3/2/01 566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01 550208 - 3/15/01 The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet. +____________ =         1016.75 Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up for March! Thanks, Kate

I just finally heard back from the traders on this deal. Apparently, Idaho's schedule was cut by the ISO on Sunday, and therefore, we had to cut our sale to them. The deal was originally 25 mw on peak, but was cut about 10 mw each hour. That's why each hour now shows 15 mw and some scraps. The remainder of the schedule we sold in the hour ahead market. This is a typical maneuver when the ISO cuts schedules, but I guess you guys haven't had to confirm daily deals in this situation before. Let me know if this is going to be a problem, and we'll figure something out. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   04/02/2001 12:00 PM 
Kate, please check, deal 565759.01, I verballed the trade with APB on Friday 3/30/01 Enron Sells Idaho 4/2-4/2 220.00    total mw s400 sp 15 Looks like it has been changed, each hour a different mw. Please let me know the details. Thanks Stephanie

Here is the information I received back from IT in Houston regarding the Forward Obligation Report. It looks like, for our purposes, the most accurate way to run the report is showing only term deals. The ""Schedule"" and ""Liquidate"" versions of the report do not capture desk-to-desk deals, and therefore will not show our traders' positions in relation to each other, which I believe is what we're looking for. Am I right? Or totally crazy? Let me know what you think. Thanks, Kate 
Good afternoon, IT Wizards - I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a chance. Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support
