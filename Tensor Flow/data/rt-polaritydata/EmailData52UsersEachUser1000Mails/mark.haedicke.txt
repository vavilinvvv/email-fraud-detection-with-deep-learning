How would we do this efficiently in EWS?  Mark 
Pete Van De Gohm of EES has again raised the topic of inventorying our trade secret protection which has been discussed from time to time.  I have visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue. Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to a specific operating group. I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit. Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in agreement with the proposed plan.  Please respond as soon as possible if you 
What is the status of our discussions with Carlos?   Mark 
Mark,  although I will hate to lose  Carlos and everyone here at EECC and NEPCO wants him to stay, in point of fact he has repaid his debt to society and is entitled to look at opportunites outside of EECC now. Please feel free to talk with him. He is discussing matters with Vicki et al now, and  she is aware that he will be contacting ENA (EWS?)as well. As background, it was understood at the time we took Carlos on board that his long term career interests were not limited to our construction work, and, consistent with his resume, I have kept him mostly focused on our equity and finance related matters (including work-outs).  I do think well of Carlos, and certainly believe that he is a lawyer that Enron wants to keep. Carlos Sole 12/01/2000 09:36 AM 
Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

Dave: I have attached the ""time allocations"" (which are used for inside costs only) by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement? Mark

Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program: 1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary. 2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is being scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further. Mark Haedicke 
I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I propose the following: 1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 months 2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only the deal terms at the end of a call The first change could be made immediately and the second change would require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes. Mark Haedicke

My accomplishments for the year 2000 include the following: 1.    EEI Form Master Power Contract -- ENA Legal led the industry development of the first master power contract.  The form is rapidly becoming the industry standard for North America and in the process dramatically lowering costs and increasing liquidity.  In October, we put an EEI into place with PG&E with the result that Enron credit exposure is $50,000,000 less than under the prior contract. 2.    New Legal Risk Rating Methodology -- implemented a legal rating system which simplifies the review of legal risks and makes it much easier to determine whether or not we are being appropriately compensated for the legal risks. 3.    EWS Legal Website for Training -- website has gone live for training regarding all major EWS legal issues.  This website will reduce training costs and increase availability of training to all employees. 4.    Developing New Businesses -- integral part of developing and structuring Enron Online, bandwidth trading, equity trading, Clickpaper.com, insurance, pulp, coal, Japan and Australia. 5.     Litigation Settlements -- many disputes were settled favorably including Fort James, California Px, TVA and BPA. 6.    Deal Machine Never Stops -- projects having lots of complex legal issues cutting across multiple disciplines including MG Metals, Las Vegas Cogen II, Pastoria, sale of the Peakers, sale of HPL, Electrobolt, JV with Texaco (Bridgeline), posting agreements for Enron Online, East Coast Power, QF restructurings like Motown, Project Summer (sale of international assets) and on and on. 7.    Deregulation of Energy Trading -- ENA legal formed an energy coalition and worked through ISDA and our Washington office to pass legislation to significantly reduce CFTC oversight of ENA's trading business. 8.    Management -- built a deal-oriented team that understands the underlying businesses and is working to share the legal technology across

This is about a trip to Brazil.  She asked me to pay the $6000 in expenses. Do you see any rationale to pay for this?  Mark 
Mark, Thanks for looking into the People's to People program for me.    Instead of asking Cliff for full funding perhaps it would be ""better received"" to suggest 50% funding?   If it doesn't look like that would work either, would it be ok with Enron's policy to go on my own? Thanks.  (I hope that I'm not being a nuisance about this Mark, if so, just say the word and I'll drop it!) Monica

Mark, Just wanted to let you know that Sheila has been doing a truly outstanding job for West Power lately.  There has been some big, thankless challenges related to transacting around our new finance vehicle, Turbopark, and she might feel a little beat up by the experience, but she has performed extremely well.

Alan, As we discussed the other day, I'm forwarding my ""work list"" of projects either currently or soon to be underway that will be led by V V Rao's team out of Singapore (with support from Dubai and Houston): 1. Australia -- Northwest Shelf LNG ""Wedge Quantities"" bid.  Proposal for mid-term, firm (but declining over time) LNG supply for merchant trading activities prepared and being sent to NWS next week.  Preparation and negotiations of SPA, transportation and marketing contracts to follow. 2. Australia -- Northwest Shelf LNG Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft prepared and being sent to counterparty next week.  Negotiations to follow. 3. Indonesia -- PERTAMINA Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft prepared and being sent to counterparty next week.  Negotiations to follow. 4. Japan -- Osaka Gas Co. Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft prepared and sent to counterparty.  Expect responsive comments next week. Negotiations to follow. 5. Malaysia/Spain -- LNG fuel supply for Enron's Arcos IPP in Spain -- initial term sheet under development.  Expect this one to heat up in the next few months. 6. Malaysia -- Malaysia LNG Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft prepared and will be sent to counterparty later in the month.  Negotiations to follow. 7. Malaysia -- ""Bintulu Hub"" e-commerce venture with Malaysia LNG, Malaysia Int'l. Trading Co., Enron LNG Marketing and Enron Networks -- under development.  Legal needs will depend somewhat on final deal format.  Goal is to be set up for LNG commodity and LNG transportation capacity e-trading (possibly on a Deal Bench auction site platform) by year-end.  May expand to cover crude oil commodity and transportation capacity trading as well following recent meetings in London. 8. Japan -- LNG Receiving Terminal & gas and power marketing joint development project with Enron LNG Marketing LLC, BHP and EnCom.  Initial draft of joint development MOU prepared.  Negotiations to follow. 9. Korea -- KOGAS Winter Cargo Supply & Transportation Opportunities -- under develoopment.  Various MOU drafts have been exchanged, but deal structure and timing keep moving around.  Legal needs will ultimately depend somewhat on final deal format. 10. Master LNG Vessel Transportation Capacity Access/Trading Agreements -- under early development, but should accelerate to match pace of no. 7 above. Document will then be used to propose access to numerous other LNG vessel owners/charterers who may wish to participate with Enron in making a market for spare transportation capacity.  Initial draft underway in Houston, but may be handed off to Singapore at some point. As you can see, there's presently quite a lot of activity being undertaken from Singapore.  Much of this has arisen since the beginning of this year. Nancy and I have been involved in preparing initial drafts, providing comments, etc. from Houston (and occasional fly-in appearances)  and V V presently has on-the-ground legal support from an excellent Linklaters Team based in Singapore.  Matt Lee has now circled with V V's team and is undergoing both intensive commercial LNG training and intensive LNG trading contract training.  I suspect that on average this year, we could easily use 70-100% of  Matt Lee's time (depending on how the above activities progress). Kind regards, Dan 
Thanks for raising the issue.  Keep me posted!   Mark Christian Yoder 03/08/2001 09:38 AM 
Whereas in the California phase of the western power crisis, we had to deal with the emergence of a new governmental agency, CDWR, and figure out whether or not and how it might pay us,  in the next, northwest phase, where we will probably have to deal with the disintegration, or at least misbehavior,  of a powerful federal rogue agency, BPA, one issue that will invariably arise is payment default by BPA.  As we have blithely sailed along with BPA up until now, we often say to ourselves,  ""Oh, when you contract with BPA, you are backed by the good faith and credit of the United States of America.""  I would like you both to put your heads together and decide who at your firm can give us a memo addressing BPA's payment mechanisms from a legal, statutory perspective.  It bothers me to hear things like;  ""they only have $700 million in their warchest,""  or ""if they can't make their Treasury payment they are toast.""  What do these kinds of remarks mean to us legally? Are we contracting with the surplus bloated   Treasury of the United States of America or are we going to have a rude surprise and find out that we are contracting with one of these discrete funds that can run out of cash and be held hostage by warring politicians?   We need a concise legal analysis of this point very soon. ----cgy 
Do you have any comments on this contract?  Please let me and Chris know. Mark 
Mark - Attached is a draft of a 3 year, 30 MW power transaction that Enron Canada Corp. is contemplating entering into with Atlantic Packaging Products Ltd.  The form of agreement is the one-off industrial form that is back-to-backed  by the British Energy supply source.  We have used this form for the Sunoco, TransCanada and Ivaco transactions.  As with the other agreements, the transaction is conditional on, among other things, Ontario Market opening occurring by November 30, 2001. Regards CJG 
Mark: I would like to get together at the AGM.  I will ask my assistant to work on a time would could meet and propose that to you.  Hope things are going well. Mark Haedicke Mark.Harding@CliffordChance.com 03/07/2001 12:55 PM 
Mark, Remembering that we missed each other in London, will you be at the AGM in DC? If so, shall we get together briefly? I met Mark Evans from your team in London recently and had a useful chat about the state of the relationship between CC and Enron. I also know that David Yeres from our NY office met with you some time back in Houston. He will also be at the AGM and would, I know, like to follow up on that meeting. Best regards.

Tim agrees that a half day legal strategy session about the pending summer melt down should happen sooner rather than later.   I understand that Richard and Elizabeth are scheduling a trip to Portland for the first week in April. I will coordinate their schedules with Tim's and tie down the details. Here is what I intend to do in the meantime.  Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated: Get our major summer trading positions identified and get the contractual underpinings organized.  This is something that Kim Theriot's group can help us with. Meet with our  fundamentals leader and our head scheduler to try to understand as much as we can about how  shortage scenarios might unfold and what power flow behavior at the key delivery points might look like. Meet with Steve Walters of Stoel Rives to get his mind focussed on big picture early positioning moves we might wish to take with BPA. Get Marcus Wood to help us refine our understanding of BPA Surplus firm and Excess Federal Power and how BPA might reasonably be expected to act with respect to each. Get credit to figure out if there is anyway we can get BPA to post a large amount of LC collateral to us. ----cgy 
Peter: As we have discussed, I think we probably need someone other than Dan.  I don't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers in Canada.  I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.  We can't ignore that.  Let's generally talk that through with Jim. Regards, Mark Peter Keohane 03/07/2001 08:46 AM 
Mark, a few thoughts: 1.  Dan Fournier asked me to go to lunch so he could update me on his ""very positive meeting"" with Jim and you.  I told Dan, politely, that I am very tired of talking to the issue and really have nothing more to add.  I hope that is OK with you.  To be honest, I am really tired of talking to the issue and dealing with Dan Fournier's political maneuvering, but I am also concerned that it seems apparent that the result of his meeting with you and Jim is that he thinks he is back in the saddle with Enron.  I have lost trust and confidence in Dan Fournier and as I mentioned Dan's approach within Blakes becomes exclusive and results in inefficient allocation of Blakes resources to our files.  He tries to conquer the client and thereby alienates the talent within his firm.  I know for a fact, after he has squeezed others out on our work and his mismanagement of this issue with Enron, that if Dan is back in the saddle, many of his partners will not been keen on doing our work under Dan's terms.  I also know that there is a philosophy in Houston to commercial people not having say in legal retainers, but I believe that the senior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions, particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market, have an important place in the relationship, and in that regard, I know Fournier has lost the trust and confidence of Rob Milnthorp. 2.  Regarding Donahue Ernst and Young, it should be borne in mind that the initial contact to doing work at their firm was through Jordan Mintz and Morris Clark on the tax side.  I also know Jordan thinks well not just of their firm but of the multidisciplinary business model.  I also think that Jim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away, and likely to expand in Canada, the US and Europe and is something we likely cannot ignore.  Also, the circumstances you will recall for us using DEY initially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retail market, where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were all conflicted and in an area where Blakes is particularly weak in Calgary.  (We first approached Stikemans, which had conflict with Enmax, and Bennett Jones, which had a conflict with ATCO.  Other firms which we do not typically use but which had experience also had conflicts.  After that, I solicited written propsals from both Blakes and DEY and interviewed with them with the retail team.)  Frankly, DEY has done good work for us.  E&Y is also very well situated on the market development side in Ontario, a leading proponent of deregulation of the Ontario market, and worked with us to set up our systems in Toronto for market opening. 3.  Should I e-mail to Jim a proposed agenda for our call on the 20th outlining the firms we currently use in different capacities in Canada? Blakes, Bennett Jones, Stikemans, Oslers, Donahue E&Y, or is a less structurd call anticipated? Peter. Peter.

Enron Canada plans to subscribe to a private placement of common shares in Impact Energy Inc. as a merchant equity investment, which private placement is closing tomorrow. The acquisition will be made pursuant to a standard long form subscription agreement.  Impact Energy is a publicly traded Canadian junior oil and gas company (trades on the TSE under the symbol TEY), which resulted from the reorganization of Startech Energy by and with ARC Energy in January 2001.  Kyle plans on subscribing for 545,455 common shares at a price per share of CDN$0.55, for total consideration of $300,000.25.  Under Canadian securities legislation, there will be a hold period imposed on the shares of one year from the date of issuance of the shares, meaning that Enron Canada will be prevented from reselling the shares in the open market for one year, unless it resells them pursuant to another exemption from the prospectus requirements available under such securities legislation.

Hi Mark, Sami Arap, John Novak & I are in the process of developing a new matrix for arbitration in Brazil on certain types of trading contracts for your approval.   Until that is complete, however, Sami & John have identified the following spot market contracts as needing immediate approval for dispute resolution clauses agreeing to ICC administered arbitration in Sao Paulo or Rio.  As you are aware, this is somewhat contrary to our traditional policy for out of country ICC arbitration.  The counter parties in these transactions will not agree to arbitration outside Brazil.  Given the nature of these contracts, I believe ICC administered arbitration in Brazil is an acceptable means for dispute resolution.  I've discussed this with Rob and he is in agreement subject to your approval. Regards, Michelle

Mark - I'm attaching the March report for EGA.  I understand that the length is still probably more than you want -- we will keep working on winnowing it down.  I tended to leave in more discussion of troubled projects like SECLP and Dabhol. I hope all is well.  I've been on the road for some time and am currently in Singapore.  I'm likely to head back to Bombay for at least the first few days of next week. Bruce 
Put this meeting on my schedule.  Mark 
FYI, more background. JWVS 
On Thursday afternoon, March 22, at 2:30PM in the Doubletree La Salle Ballroom, we will have an All Employee Meeting to discuss Enron Engineering and Operations Services (EEOS).  Mark Frevert and Dan Leff will join Brian Stanley, John Gillis, and the two of us for this discussion.  Led by Mark and Dan, we have been on a corporate journey to determine the best method to provide a resource base for the building , operating, and maintaining of our existing and planned major assets. The discussions evolved around two major issues. First,  most of the engineering and project management resources were concentrated in the former EE &CC, but operational resources were spread among several groups.  OEC provided operational support to some, but not all Enron assets.  Second, the clear need for both the engineering and operational resources was in Wholesale not Retail (EES).  There will be some need to help EES bridge into Industrial clients, but this need is minor compared to the requirements of Wholesale.  As a benefit of the time Mark and Dan plus other Executive Committee Members put into the decision  to form EEOS, we believe we are correctly positioned to effectively address Enron's major project needs.  Our Thursday meeting is an open forum to discuss these and other issues you might have with our new or perhaps more clearly defined position. We look forward to seeing you on Thursday. Keith Dodson Chief Operating Officer - EEOS Ken Bean Vice President - Operational Energy Corp. 
I don't have a problem with it, subject to our normal litigation exception. Mark ""JOHN G KLAUBERG"" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM> 03/14/2001 06:04 PM 
Mark: I am attaching a copy of a brief memo I received from one of my partners in our Houston office about a potential representation of a company called Centrans, which apparently is a partner with Enron in a Guatemala power project.  Centrans apparently plans to sell a piece of its interest to a Fund, in which Enron also owns and interest (although I do not know how much). We would represent Centrans in selling its interest to the Fund.  I am not sure, but I do not get the sense from my conversation with my partner that Enron plans to take an active role in the Fund purchase.  So, from a conflicts analytical standpoint, this would seem to be analogous to LeBoeuf representing a buyer in connection with the sale of an asset to a corporation in which Enron is a shareholder. Do you have any concerns with LeBoeuf representing Centrans on this sale? Are there any unique facts or circumstances here that you may be aware of that could create a potential problem from your standpoint?  I assume this transaction would fall within your ""world"" but, if not, is there somebody else that I should check with on this?  We understand that Thelen Reid & Priest is representing the Fund. Thanks, as usual, Mark, for your consideration.  Perhaps you could just reply to this e-mail or ask Janette to give me a call if it is ok.

Mark, I thought you might be interested in the attached note Elizabeth kindly sent to me.  I can't emphasize enough the number of significant issues we were able to accomplish in Blue Range, which included not just the first decision in Canada regarding the categorization of physicals and financials as forward contracts (we call them eligible financial contracts) entitled to protection under insolvency (which Elizabeth has referred to as the safe harbor), but also included:  the first decision in Canada that a shareholders claim against management for neglect, although normally an unsecured claim is subordinated in insolvency; a decision confirming rights of set-off both before and after the insolvency; and at least quadrupling our anticipated recovery by making a bid to by Blue Range's assets out of the insolvent estate.

We are implementing a legal team meeting with a smaller group that will meet during weeks when we don't have the all hands Legal Staff meeting.  The Legal Team meeting will be held every other Friday at 9:00 Houston time (currently 12:00 noon S?o Paulo/Rio time) starting tomorrow.  The idea of the smaller group meeting is to get updates on the key deals/assets in the region so we can keep Houston current on a weekly basis when the larger legal staff meeting is not scheduled. While the group included on this call may change from time to time as deal priorities change, currently I would like to allocate reporting responsibility as follows:  Arap (key trading/origination deals); Watanabe (Eletrobolt); Vasco (Elektro); Porto (CEG/Gas Business Unit); Mendoza (Transredes sale process); and Novak (Cuiab?). I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Bob:  I am going to pass on the playoff tickets.  Thanks.   Mark ""Baird, Bob"" <RBaird@velaw.com> 03/27/2001 01:45 PM 
Mark and Rob: Rockets have been looking good (despite the recent slump) and have a chance to make the playoffs.  (I heard on the radio this morning that Hakeem may be back.) So the Rockets have sent out invoices for playoff tickets.  We are supposed to respond by this Friday, March 30. This year (perhaps because they know there's a decent chance they won't make the playoffs) the Rockets are invoicing playoff tickets in two installments. The first installment covers rounds one and two, and the second covers the Western Conference Finals and the NBA Championship. I can't tell whether if you commit for the first two rounds you have a legal obligation to buy the second and third if they make it to the Western Conference Finals, but I assume that doesn't matter (we should assume that a commitment now means a financial commitment for the entire playoffs). Rounds 1 and 2 encompass 6 games.  $549 per seat, or $2,196 total.  That's two games in Round 1 at $88.50 per ticket, and four games in Round 2 at $93.00 per ticket. Rounds 3 and 4 (which we wouldn't have to pay for until later) are $916 per seat, or $3,664.  I assume that Rounds 3 and 4 will include 8 games. For the regular season I had 6/44 of the tickets, which is 13.6%.  That's approximately 1 ticket in Rounds 1 and 2 and 1 ticket in Rounds 3 and 4. I'd be glad to spring for that, although if you all want all the playoff tickets that's fine also. So I suppose how much it's going to cost each of you depends on whether my ticket is Round 1 or 2.  If it's in round 2 each of you would pay $912 for the first two rounds, and if it's in round 1 each of you would pay $921.  If the two of you want all the playoff tickets, each of you would pay $1,098 for Rounds 1 and 2. This year the Rockets are saying that if the tickets are not used you can ask for a refund by the same means that you paid.  So what I would propose to do it put all the charges on my credit card and if they don't make the playoffs that charge will be reversed; and it may not even make it on my bill if they don't make the playoffs. Since I will put it on my card I won't need your money until about the 20th of April. So please let me know if you want to commit and whether you want me to take a ticket out of each of the sets of rounds. (I'm fine either way) Robert S. Baird Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.

I am ok with your slate, but need some Houston people on board as well.  I think we can shorten the Houston list by taking me off since John Novak will be on the board.  I leave it to Bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the list further.  Mark Orlando Gonzalez@ENRON 03/27/2001 01:51 PM 
Did you  get a chance to review the Elektro board make up.  I would like to finalize before the next ordinary shareholder meeting in Brazil.   Thanks --------------- See attached regarding Elektro's board membership.  We would suggest that the board slate be made up of Brazil residents in order to facilitate the necessary meetings. I would like to include Joe Kishkill, John Novak, Brett Wiggs, Britaldo Soares and Joao Carlos Albuquerque, all members of our executive committee to substitute Rick Waddell, Diomedes, Jim Bannantine, and Rick Lammers.  If  you agree, I will talk to Rebecca to finalize.  Thanks 
Bruce,  This solution does not work for Brazilian entities for legal reasons.    I will send a summary of the current situation and a proposal to resolve. We can discuss during your visit.  Thanks Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 31/01/2001 19:26 
Folks - The Legal Specialists in EGA are working up new director/officer slates for the EGA entities.  We will be appointing the following list of directors for EGA entities: Rebecca McDonald Jim Hughes Jeff Sommers Jim Derrick Mark Haedicke There will be some exceptions to this slate, particularly where local law or the necessity of regular board attendance requires additional (or even different) directors to be appointed.  These will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Allow the Legal Specialists the opportunity to come up with their tentative slates and then we will give them to the regional heads for comment. Some of you will be asked to resign your current directorships.  I hope that no one will take offense to the fact of of the changed slates -- none is intended.  We have found that this common slate has made corporate governance more efficient and less complicated. Thank you for your cooperation.  Please pass this message along to others in your respective groups as you deem necessary. Bruce 
Orlando: As per your request, please find bellow the names of all of the present members of Elektro's Board. Firstly is to be mentioned that according to Elektro's By Laws, the Board may have a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 7 permanent members (one obligatorily must be elected by appointment of Elektros' employees) and a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 alternates (one obligatorily to act solely as alternate to the employees' representative at the Board) Permanent members: Diomedes Christodoulou (President) Orlando Goanz?lez Ricky Linn Waddell Geraldo Gon?alves Pereira (elected by appointment of Elektro's employees) Vacant (3) Alternate members: James Martin Bannantine Richard Allan Lammers Ricardo Louren?o Carneiro (alternate to Geraldo Gon?alves) Vacant (3) The election and/or dismissal of the Board members has to be decided by the shareholders of the company. Normally the election o the Board members takes place at the annual Ordinary Shareholder's meeting. (This year, our OGM is scheduled to take place on April, 29th.) However this matter  can also be decided at any time via an Extraordinary Shareholder's Meeting  that has to be called trough a  Board Resolution that  has to be publicized at the Official Gazette no later than 8 days prior to date of such EGM. Should the present number of the Board members be maintained (i.e 4 permanent and 3 alternates), the election of new members (from our side) will have to be made upon the resignation of those presently on seat. Should you deem necessary, please call me at your earliest convenience. Least but nol east As I vave mentined to you the other day, it is quite normal to appoint the senior legal council as an alternate to the permanent members of the Board so that he may legally be present at all the board meetings

Enron Canada Corp.; 2.  Enron North America Corp.; 3.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited; and 4.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. The one key sticking point relates to the governing law is to be England and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of English courts. I have suggested to the counterparty that we use New York law as a compromise.  However, in the event that they will not accept the amendment, are you okay with using the law of England and the exclusive jurisdiction of English courts? Please let me know your thoughts when you have the opportunity.  You can reach me in Houston at 52520 and in Calgary at 820-6708. Thanks, Mark Powell 
It looks great.  Mark Vance Meyer@ENRON 03/27/2001 06:39 PM

Louise: Is Enron ready for this?  I think it is a good suggestion for the most significant deals.  It is really positive in that it would force dealmakers to pay more attention to what the contracts provide.  I am not sure it makes sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed.  Let's talk about what are the objectives.  Great question! Mark Louise Kitchen 03/28/2001 04:27 PM 
Response? 
We have spoken about this before, the issue is that Enron Americas has no approval mechanism for contracts. Neither does any other group but that is not my problem.  I have spent too much time reading DASH forms which really do not provide full authorization. There are two suggestions that I would like to be implemented: (i) DASH forms need to include all of the contracts which are to be signed under the deal.  So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the contracts to be signed in the deal.  Any contracts which are not included need to go through the process outlined below. (ii) All contracts need a Contract Approval Form attached and Enron's legal team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed (ie signed) by the following Enron staff. Trader/Originator ________________________________ Head of Group (VP or above)______________________ Credit__________________________________________ Legal__________________________________________ Tech Services (where applicable)__________________ Commercial Support (where applicable)_____________ A database of all completed contracts on behalf of Enron Americas needs to be maintained by Legal. Thoughts please?

As i have mentioned, I need to fill the vacant Carlos Sole slot here at EEOS. Vicki had agreed this, but I wanted to run this past you before I move on it.  Between the work we do to support the ENA projects, the Pipeline Group work, and our claims and litigation, I think I do need to fill the vacancy with a lawyer. I have identified a candidate that has significant construction experience that I would like to bring in next Tuesday afternoon for an initial screen, but before I do that I wanted to see if you are on board with me filling the slot. I  would not trouble you with an interview request unless after I meet her I think she is a strong enough candidate to pursue further. JWVS 
Print out?   Mark 
You should continue to sign the dashes and just alert me to any matter going to Frevert or Whalley.  Thanks.  Mark John Schwartzenburg@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/29/2001 02:17 PM 
Mark, I have not talked to you about whether you want me to sign-off on DASHes before they go Buy/Glisan/Skilling. I was doing so for EECC and NEPCO for Vicki, but you might want to revisit that. The attached are for two of our work-out projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Please have a look and let me know if you want to sign DASHEs for thsi unit or if you prefer that I continue to sign them.

FYI, I received verbal notice today that EPE has been fined in the amount of R$2.2 million (approx US$1.1 million) for failure to comply with its IPP license -- specifically, the failure to dispatch at 450 MW per the instructions of the ONS.  Aneel previously had delivered a notice of noncompliance to EPE and our response was delivered to Aneel on Friday, so the fine probably crossed our response in the mail. This is another salvo in the ongoing dispute as to whether our PPA, which pre-dates the new regulatory scheme, is to be treated as an exception or whether it needs to be completely renegotiated in order to be able to comply with the current regs.  In any event, it is not good news.  I will keep you posted as I get more details. Regards, John

My particular concern is that the large majority of Enron's derivatives business is in North America.  We are growing rapidly in derivatives in Europe, but still quite small.  In terms of derivatives, we are not a factor on other continents.  That is different than major equity, currency or interest rate traders.

Jeff:  Let's talk about this and how to start handling Don Black's legal work.  Mark 
FYI 
In light of the transition of the risk books to ENA, I need your input on whether we (EES) should continue to pursue our own master contracts with new trading partners.  In certain instances, ENA already has a master in place with the counterparty or in other instances (TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc. & Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation), ENA Legal is currently negotiating a separate master with the counterparty. The Gas Desk is pressing hard for a number of new masters with additional counterparties.  While we are set up to handle their requests, in light of the organization changes, it seems this may be unnecessary.  Even where ENA does not currently have or is not currently negotiating a master, they may prefer that the document be handled by ENA legal and avoid having to assign the master to them at a later date.    I would like to have your thoughts before I commit resources to handle these requests. If you prefer that we continue to pursue these new master, we have the resources available to proceed. Jim

Hurray!  More good news from Argentina!  Today the Argentine Supreme Court granted TGS an injunction against payment of the stamp tax assessed by the Province of Rio Negro pending resolution of the matter.  Rio Negro recently rejected TGS's final administrative appeal against payment of the tax with penalties and interest in the amount of US $436 million!  Rio Negro had ordered payment by April 26 and threatened to commence collection proceedings.  Recall that 3 weeks ago, the Court also granted TGS an injunction against payment of the tax in Santa Cruz in the amount of US $17 million which was unprecedented. Dodged another bullet! Cheers!

Program Dear General Counsels: The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current contracts. This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review. In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review. We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available. Please contact me by Wednesday, April 11, 2001 and advise me of the number of contracts between the United States Government and the Enron entities you represent.  In the event any of the Enron entities which you represent have government contracts, we will need a member of your respective law department(s) to pull the government contracts, and all supporting documentation, from the Enron companies which you represent and be available to work with other members of the team. If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-7224. Thank you. Sharon

Pete Van De Gohm of EES has again raised the topic of inventorying our trade secret protection which has been discussed from time to time.  I have visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue. Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to a specific operating group. I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.

I agree with your proposal.  Please communicate with Mark Holsworth.  Mark Michelle Cash 04/11/2001 11:33 PM 
Mark, As a practical matter, I believe that it will be difficult to maintain an updated inventory of confidential information on an ongoing basis.  That conceivably could be someone's full-time job, given the vast amount of confidential and proprietary projects at issue just within EWS. I do agree that we need to put some protocols in place with regard to how Enron handles different levels of confidential information (including trade secrets).  Rather than have an ongoing commission guided by outside counsel, I would suggest that Pete, Scott Tholan, the IT security team, internal corporate security, as well as legal subject matter experts get together to put forth guidelines on how information should be retained and protected. Those guidelines would describe the type of information at issue and the corresponding security measures to put in place to protect that material. For example, trading positions and curves would have one standard for access and disclosure, while personnel information would have a different one.  The benefit to this approach is that we can set the guidelines and manage on a periodic basis to make sure that they are followed, rather than create updated inventories. It also presumably would save on outside counsel fees.  I would not view this type of approach as requiring much, if any, assistance from outside counsel. Let me know your thoughts.

Mark; The Brazilian Central Bank created a structure of access to the interest rate, currency and commodity swaps international market that is based on 3 main points as follows: payments and receipts arising from hedging modes  (trading on the offshore stock market as well as on the forward, futures and option markets) as well as remittances to or from abroad inherent to these transactions (spread, commissions, premiums and so on) will be effected in foreign currency upon prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange market; remittances intended for the opening of current accounts with brokerage companies abroad as well as for deposits of collateral margins are permitted; and upon preliminary approval by the Central Bank, remittances abroad intended for collateral and escrow deposits linked to interest rate and currency swaps can be effected. The key issue of this structure is that the income tax on remittances to overseas that can be demonstrated to be remittances usual, normal and necessary for hedging transactions on the international market can be reduced by 100%.  In addition to any positive results for the foreign institutions from these operations, the spread, commissions, premiums, and other related sums. when remitted abroad, will not be subject to any income tax withholdings.  With respect to the tax treatment of losses that Brazilian companies may incur as a result of hedging operations, such losses may be deductible for the purpose of determining taxable profits, only in the event that they occur in investments on exchanges abroad.  If these transactions are not carried out on such exchanges, the losses will not be deductible when determining the taxable profits. Brazilian entities are not prevented to enter into swap or other derivative transactions on the international market in case they do not meet the requirements established above.  The consequences, however, will be the following: payments and receipts arising from such transactions as well as remittances to or from abroad inherent to these transactions could not be effected in foreign currency upon prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange market, but only through mechanisms available in the or related to the floating (or ""tourism"") exchange rate; the inflow of foreign currency through the floating rate market would be subject to IOF (tax on financial transactions) assessed at the rate of 2% on the Brazilian currency equivalent of the foreign funds entering Brazil; remittance of any amounts that are considered income of a foreign resident shall be subject to withholding income tax at 15% or at a reduced rate if the creditor is domiciled in a country  with which Brazil has entered into a double taxation treaty . To the best of my knowledge, you will appreciate that the ISDA Master Agreement has been widely used by foreign swap dealers with Brazilian counterparties. Rgds, Sami

I have seen a negotiation facility that I whink it would be worth showing to each of you for your consideration. I have suggested the 23rd or the 24th of April as possible dates for a demo, which would probably be via the Internet. Please let me know your availability either of those days. The facility is one developed by Beachfire, one of the bidders on the proposal. You should have their proposal, but I will also forward several items I have received from them. Bob

Mark:  I had a request from Doug Hawes as to whether there might be a senior Enron commercial person in France that he could make contract with regarding a project he is working on (see attached e-mail).  Since I know that France falls within your ""world,"" I thought you might have a good feeling for who Doug might be able to contact.  If you are ok with Doug making such a contact and you could perhaps suggest a person Doug could call, I know that Doug would be greatly appreciative. Thanks, Mark.

John:  I know you are busy, but when you get a chance could you let me know if you think you could get me an introduction to the Head Enron person in France assuming there is one.  The reason is I am working with a very successful LBO firm of medium size by French standards.  The project is in the process of being defined, but it is essentially a web site that brings together a number of elements of the energy field including electricity, gas and petroleum.  I would like to find out what the Enron person thinks is available and what is not available that would be useful.  It might be that Enron would want to participate in some fashion eventually, but the contact would not be about that.  It does not matter if it is an English or a French speaker.  Perhaps they run their presumably modest operation out of some other place like London.  I would be happy to go wherever the person is.  By the way, did you see the article in this week's EUW that says there is going to be an electricity trading market in France starting in May?  Because of EDF's expansion ambitions elsewhere especially in Europe they are beginning to get serious about opening up the market here.  Regards. Doug

In order to finalize the board composition for the Annual shareholders meeting to be held on April 30 I suggest the following: The board according to the by laws has permanent members (min 4, max 7) and alternates (min 2, max 4).  We are also required to have an employee representative as a permanent member and an alternate.  We would like to have a maximun participation of local residents in order to facilitate board meetings. Permanent members:                            Alternates: Employee rep                                        Employee rep Orlando  Gonzalez                                  Jim Hughes, Joe Kishkill                                               John Novak Rebecca McDonald                                Jeff Sommers Jim Derrick Joao Carlos Albuquerque Britaldo Soares This allows for five local residents and the Houston membership we needed.  I would like your opinion as soon as possible so I can discuss with Rebecca in order to elect the board on April 30th.  Thanks Orlando 
I am ok with your slate, but need some Houston people on board as well.  I think we can shorten the Houston list by taking me off since John Novak will be on the board.  I leave it to Bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the list further.  Mark Orlando Gonzalez@ENRON 03/27/2001 01:51 PM 
Did you  get a chance to review the Elektro board make up.  I would like to finalize before the next ordinary shareholder meeting in Brazil.   Thanks --------------- See attached regarding Elektro's board membership.  We would suggest that the board slate be made up of Brazil residents in order to facilitate the necessary meetings. I would like to include Joe Kishkill, John Novak, Brett Wiggs, Britaldo Soares and Joao Carlos Albuquerque, all members of our executive committee to substitute Rick Waddell, Diomedes, Jim Bannantine, and Rick Lammers.  If  you agree, I will talk to Rebecca to finalize.  Thanks 
Bruce,  This solution does not work for Brazilian entities for legal reasons.    I will send a summary of the current situation and a proposal to resolve. We can discuss during your visit.  Thanks Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 31/01/2001 19:26 
Folks - The Legal Specialists in EGA are working up new director/officer slates for the EGA entities.  We will be appointing the following list of directors for EGA entities: Rebecca McDonald Jim Hughes Jeff Sommers Jim Derrick Mark Haedicke There will be some exceptions to this slate, particularly where local law or the necessity of regular board attendance requires additional (or even different) directors to be appointed.  These will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Allow the Legal Specialists the opportunity to come up with their tentative slates and then we will give them to the regional heads for comment. Some of you will be asked to resign your current directorships.  I hope that no one will take offense to the fact of of the changed slates -- none is intended.  We have found that this common slate has made corporate governance more efficient and less complicated. Thank you for your cooperation.  Please pass this message along to others in your respective groups as you deem necessary. Bruce 
Orlando: As per your request, please find bellow the names of all of the present members of Elektro's Board. Firstly is to be mentioned that according to Elektro's By Laws, the Board may have a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 7 permanent members (one obligatorily must be elected by appointment of Elektros' employees) and a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 alternates (one obligatorily to act solely as alternate to the employees' representative at the Board) Permanent members: Diomedes Christodoulou (President) Orlando Goanz?lez Ricky Linn Waddell Geraldo Gon?alves Pereira (elected by appointment of Elektro's employees) Vacant (3) Alternate members: James Martin Bannantine Richard Allan Lammers Ricardo Louren?o Carneiro (alternate to Geraldo Gon?alves) Vacant (3) The election and/or dismissal of the Board members has to be decided by the shareholders of the company. Normally the election o the Board members takes place at the annual Ordinary Shareholder's meeting. (This year, our OGM is scheduled to take place on April, 29th.) However this matter  can also be decided at any time via an Extraordinary Shareholder's Meeting  that has to be called trough a  Board Resolution that  has to be publicized at the Official Gazette no later than 8 days prior to date of such EGM. Should the present number of the Board members be maintained (i.e 4 permanent and 3 alternates), the election of new members (from our side) will have to be made upon the resignation of those presently on seat. Should you deem necessary, please call me at your earliest convenience. Least but nol east As I vave mentined to you the other day, it is quite normal to appoint the senior legal council as an alternate to the permanent members of the Board so that he may legally be present at all the board meetings

Subcontracting Program 
Do the firms described below by Sheila come within the scope?   Mark 
Subcontracting Program Do our Contract Administration folks (Carolyn Gilley, Mary Salmonson) work with these forms and contracts.  The only ""small businesses"" that I'm aware of are the various consulting firms and other service entities (law firms, recruiting firms) that we use.  We have a consulting agreement data base and also a data base of law firm engagement agreements.  Either Ed Hearn or Kay Young could help access these contracts. Mark E Haedicke Sent by: Janette Elbertson 04/11/2001 03:19 PM 
Subcontracting Program Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts as described below by Sharon Butcher. ""The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current contracts. This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review. In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review. We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
Looks like a good candidate.  I am around all next week. Regards, Mark Peter Keohane 04/20/2001 03:45 PM 
Janette - Can you call Sharon to co-ordinate 5-10 minutes when Mark is available to discuss the attached. Mark -  I want to discuss with you a candidate, with the following background information.  Sorry for the long memo but it might make our discussion more efficient. I wanted to see if I could recruit someone with 4-6 years major law firm experience and whom I knew or could confirm by my contacts as having a reputation as a quality lawyer and person with broad corporate and commercial experience.  Perhaps I am getting too far removed from that level, but I was able to come up with only one candidate that I think is worthy of pursuing. If he proves unsatisfactory, I will then have to go to an out-placement/recruitment agency, which is relatively expensive.  That said the candidate I am suggesting would to my mind be as good or better than any candidate that we may find through a formal recruitment process.  His name is Derek Flaman.  I will send his resume to you by fax. A couple of points: Strengths: (a)  Derek comes from the Donahue Ernst and Young firm and to my knowledge is a highly regarded commercial associate. (b)  Prior to that he was at Macleod Dixon and a highly regarded commercial associate there.  The Managing Partner of Donahue Ernst and Young Calgary came from Macleod Dixon Calgary and brought Derek over with him. (c)  Derek has never done any work for us, but I have met him socially a number of times and have spoken to him about this job possibility.  I think he has a down-to-earth and comfortable personality that would suit the atmosphere and stresses of Enron well. (d)  Derek was seconded internally to Husky Oil - one of DEY's major Calgary clients - for a period and has experince in-house.  He worked for an internal lawyer at Husky who is a friend of Greg Johnston and who gave excellent reviews. (e)  Although I do not have his law school grades, he tells me he finished in the top third of his class at Queens University - which among the reputable schools in Canada. (f)  He is qualified both under Alberta and Ontario law. (g)  He has met with Milnthorp and Greg Johnston, both of whom were favorably impressed. Issues: (a)  Derek graduated from law school in '94 and since that time his career has been a bit traveled.  Although there is an explanation, his continuous experience at Macleod Dixon and Donahue Ernst and Young started in '97. Before that the history is he is from a small town in Alberta.  After graduating he wanted to work at a small firm in Toronto and had an interest in labor law, and spent his first year articling to a Toronto labor boutique.  After that year he wanted to get into commercial work and out Toronto, and moved to Fraser Milner in Edmonton.  His wife then took a position at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary however, and so he moved to Macleod Dixon in Calgary.  He moved to Donahue Ernst and Young when they established their office in Calgary.  All things being considered, I am comfortable with his experience at say a 4 to 5 year level - although compensation could then be an issue (I have not discussed compensation with him). (b)  Derek's experience has been primarily in large commercial projects, especially the off-shore oil and gas developments in Hibernia and Terra Nova for Husky.  This would require some very good legal and large project organizational skills but is obviously different from a faster paced, commercially oriented, higher volume trading atmosphere.  In his secondment to Husky however he was more involved in their retail gasoline business and natural gas marketing and,  although I am sure not the atmosphere at Enron, he tells me it is an atmosphere he is comfortable with and enjoys. (c)  Do Jim Derrick's accounting/law firm concerns apply to hiring a lawyer (as opposed to retaining counse)? I would like to get back to Derek soon to discuss next steps (interview in Houston? with whom? Vicki Sharp? get a feel for compensation expectations?), or look to other alternatives. Peter. 
Neal: Thanks for the message.  We are tracking the developments in Washington very carefully.  Have Dan give me a call, if he would like.  Hope you and your family are doing well. Take care.

May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business Wednesday.  We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday. John To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom), Coal,  LNG & Weather.   Though Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure.  Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses.   Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market. Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year. The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman. Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London. By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a part of Enron Europe. EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end. The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months. In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. Nick O'Day who heads both the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shappiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial Markets. We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come. Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.

Mark and Peter - Attached is a copy of the speech made today by the Ontario Minister of Energy.  Of course we would have been much happier with an outside date or target of November 1, 2001 or  an unconditional May 1, 2002 date; however, it at least shows a commitment to deregulation. While Enron Toronto will be busy with ongoing marketing and certain major projects in the near future (the OEFC NUG Contract Management Agreement, the G6 retail initiative and the ENERconnect amendment),  the obvious umber one priority of this office in the short term will be negotiating an extension to the British Energy Supply Contract. Regards CJG 
Mr. Speaker: This Legislature passed the Energy Competition Act in 1998 to help meet the province's long-term electricity needs and ensure that Ontarians have a safe, reliable and affordable supply of power. When this government came to office in 1995, we had our work cut out for us. Ontario's electricity sector was failing us. Consumers and businesses had no choice of who supplied them with power. And we went from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the third highest in Canada. The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe, reliable and competitively-priced electricity was no longer working. It had become out of date, inefficient and too expensive. Something had to be done. That's why I'm proud to stand up in the Legislature today to announce that: The government is confident that conditions necessary to open the electricity market to competition will exist by May 2002. The government is committed to an open market while guaranteeing a safe, affordable and reliable supply. There are some who are fundamentally opposed to opening this market to competition. Our government believes, however, that open, competitive markets are beneficial. They keep costs low, encourage innovation and benefit consumers. There are others who share our desire to open the market, but who would like to see it done even sooner. As government, we bear a responsibility to ensure the opening is done right for all involved. To do this, we are committed to opening the market at the earliest possible date, while ensuring all of the conditions required for a smooth transition to competition are met. And I'm pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the four principles guiding the government's vision have been, or will be met, by May 2002. First and foremost, protecting consumers and offering more choice. The overall market design and regulatory framework for introducing competition puts customers first. Over the long term, a competitive market will lead to the lowest possible costs and better service for all. Second, creating a strong business climate with a reliable supply of electricity. Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current needs. Announcing a firm market opening deadline today provides greater certainty to potential new investors who have already announced 3 billion dollars in new generation projects. Thirdly, we will protect our environment. My colleague, the Minister of the Environment has announced tough new emission caps for the electricity sector. They will be among the toughest in North America, matching the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Also today, Minister Witmer is announcing changes to ensure that new electricity projects are reviewed in a clear and consistent manner under the province's environmental assessment process. And fourth, we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the search for alternative sources of power. For the first time, customers will be able to make clean air a priority by choosing the type of power they want, including wind, fuel cells and solar. Giving them choice will help promote the demand for cleaner, greener electricity. And so, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Ontario's electricity sector will open by May 2002. The government is keeping its promise to introduce a competitive electricity market. We will do it, and we have put the principles in place to ensure that we do it right. Thank you.

Mark, Enron Europe's experience is that there is some resistance to ISDA documentation in most of the European countries in which we are active. Our list of countries which we feel would benefit from promotional sessions arranged by ISDA is as follows. The countries are in order ranked by Enron Europe's view of the significance of the market in each country and where ISDA resistance is strongest. Most significant market and most resistance ranked at the top of the list for both Europe and the Far East: Europe Germany Switzerland Austria Spain Nordic countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland Netherlands Italy France Poland Czech Republic Hungary Far East Singapore Japan Hong Kong Thanks Mark

A.  Corporate Structure - To facilitate the meshing of EES' existing Canadian affiliate (Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd. (""EES Canada"")) and Enron Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership (""Enron Direct Canada"")), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows: Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada. This will involve: a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.; b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada Corp. to EES Canada; and c.  a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to Enron Direct Canada. By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada, both entities will continue to operate as they do today. As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and (ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is currently. B.  Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related ""permanent establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp. would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp.  Accordingly, Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups. Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian subsidiaries.  In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me; however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume the role. With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron Direct Canada.  With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the interim. Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed on the basis of these proposals. Regards, Mark Powell

Please put on my schedule.  Mark 
Hello everyone. In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility. Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. I would like suggestions as to: 1)  Where to go. 2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings. 3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 4)  And any other ideas you have. In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month. The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference. Regards

Florida Mark, I have a unique outside counsel request on which I'd like your approval.  I am involved with a potential power plant development project with the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida.  The project would be on their land and would potentially involve a joint venture with them.  Although we are at a preliminary stage, even the initial letter of intent that we are negotiating raises unique issues that will set the precedent for our project development agreements with respect to enforceability, jurisdiction and dispute resolution matters. I have identified and spoken with Lynn Slade of the New Mexico law firm of Modrall, Sperling, Roehl, Harris & Sisk on whether he could advise us on the Indian law issues associated with this project.  Lynn and several of his colleagues specialize on Indian law matters, and Lynn has experience both with representing Enron and in handling energy transactions in general.  In fact, Lynn gave a presentation at the 1999 Enron law conference entitled ""Energy Business in 'Indian Country': Opportunities and Obstacles"" (credit goes to Jeff Hodge for remembering that presentation and suggesting I contact Lynn); Lynn has represented several of Enron's pipeline companies, as well as the government affairs department, in connection with their Indian law issues and, at one time, prepared an opinion letter for ENA in a transaction involving the Ute tribe. Lastly, please note that I had asked our Florida counsel of Greenberg Trauig on whether they had any Indian law expertise, including specifically, any experience involving the Seminoles.  Unfortunately, the Seminoles are one of their clients so Greenberg cannot represent us in a manner adverse to the Tribe. Thanks in advance for your attention and consideration of this request.

The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.  The stay allows EES to return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC receivables.

I am looking for someone in Portand to work on power plant development that will mostly be in CA and Nevada.  I would like you to talk to Sheila Tweed in my office at 713-853-7093, who is in charge of this effort on the legal side.  I will foward your resume to her and of course tell her to keep it 
FYI 
Mark: Following up on the suggestion from Al Alexanderson that you were expecting ""a phone call and a resume"" from me, I am sending you my resume as a Word document attachment to this note. I presume that you are in fact looking for a lawyer as Al described.  I'm not going to go into any detail in this note, but if you are looking, we should talk.  I have extensive experience in both transactional and regulatory aspects of energy practice. As Sr. VP and deputy general counsel at an energy development company, I did project development work, including turnkey project sales and power purchase arrangements.  In private practice, I represented some end users, but mostly utilities, in power purchases, transmission arrangements, project development, joint ventures, and all of the other business relationships and transactions that have been used as the industry has evolved from the regulatory model to the market model.  I am assuming from Al's description that you are looking for someone for Portland, Oregon, but Al said he wasn't sure of the location.  Tell me what you are looking for, and I'll give you an honest assessment of whether I think I would be a good prospect for filling that need. Al Larsen     phone 703-351-9547 - RESUME~2.DOC 
Greetings: John, I would like to promote Hodge to VP this time around.  I know our system has changed to get that done, but I wanted to get your support on this.  I believe Jeff has done a good job  and added significant value for a long time and has earned it.  Give me your thoughts. 
Wow!  Dan please go ahead and make the call and be sure to let them know we are schocked at the amount of the billing! 
I appreciate the request, but have never given the slides I use out in electronic form.  To do that we would need to have very detailed conversations about how they would be used.  Give me a call if you still want to talk about it. 
Not clear at this point.  No deals have been done.  My guess is that it will be Lance and his group.  I will let you know when it gets sorted out.  Mark ""Swanstrom, Bill"" <BSwanstrom@lockeliddell.com> 05/20/2001 12:04 PM 
Mark, who within the Enron legal group is responsible for Enron Excelerator? From what I've heard about this initiative, it sounds like it may be doing deals similar to what we've done for Enron in the past.  We'd love to get the opportunity to help -- we have valuable experience we can bring to bear in this area.  Thanks. H.

CFTC study of retail derivatives 6.  emerging market forms for paper, steel, etc. Mark Taylor will send a list of proposed topics for the European conference. Let me know what you think.

Mark:  As I am sure you agree, I thought that CA Attorney General Lockyer's comment last week in the WSJ was one of the most outrageous I have ever seen from a major public official.  I wanted to send a brief ""Letter to the Editor"" of the WSJ to that effect.  However, in light of the sensitivity of the entire CA situation in general and the further press last week in the New York Times, I did not want to do that without confirming with you that doing so would not be objectionable to the Company.  A copy of the proposed letter is attached.  I would propose to submit this in my individual capacity, not as counsel to the Company.  I'll wait to hear from you, or from Mark, Vicki or Rick before doing anything.    Thanks.

As a suggestion you might want to allocate these questions, or any others to be asked to your direct reports at your regular meeting on Monday and where necessary they can provide you with any particular details to give as full an answer as you would like. Janette could possibly ask question numbered 1. Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do. I will of course be happy to ask any question, provided you have had the opportunity to prepare an answer. Regards, Marcus 1.When will EWS Legal Department be moving to the new building and where will we be located? 2.Will all attorneys have an office? 3.While we expect all areas of the EWS business to grow, which areas , over the next 6-12 months, do you believe will grow the fastest and require the greatest support from the EWS Legal Department? 4.With the bankruptcy of PG&E what were we able to do using our existing contracts to mitigate our exposure? 5.Are there any changes that you believe we will need to make to our contracts or any new contracts we will need to consider entering into with counterparties to assist us in managing our risk in the event of future bankruptcies? 6. Are you able to tell us what we estimate financial our exposure is to PG&E as a result of their bankruptcy? 7.Why is Enron winding down its power trading operations in Japan? 
I want to be involved as we are in the process of signing up employment contracts with Sami Arap, Louise Wantanabe and Vicki Martinez.  John Novak and I need to approve all the changes.  Thanks. Mark David Oxley/ENRON@enronXgate 06/01/2001 03:27 PM

Enron has complained about the quality of the information given to Inside FERC.  It is my understanding that requesting the counterparty data is a due diligence step that the trades really happened and that Inside FERC keeps the name of the counterparty confidential.  We want the data to be as good as possible.  If my assumptions are correct, I come out -- give the name of the counterparty with stated limitations.  Jeff Hodge, please let me know if my assumptions are correct in the US. Peter Keohane Sent by: Sharon Crawford 06/01/2001 02:56 PM 
Mark, our contracts at Sumas (which is a U.S. border delivery point in British Columbia) are settled against the Inside F.E.R.C. Sumas Index. Inside F.E.R.C. is now requiring that, in addition to pure trading data, we must also provide counterparty identification.  On the basis that we cannot provide that counterparty identification, both due to contractual obligations and business policies/practices, our information was excluded from the Sumas Index for the last index period.  I know, for example, in negotiating the settlement with NGX, that the provision of counterparty identification was a matter of very serious concern, particularly for Andy Zipper who manages EOL. However, I am advised by Jon McKay that, notwithstanding these apparent contractual restrictions and business policies/practices, Houston provides counterparty identifications to Inside F.E.R.C. The problem is that if we do not provide these counterparty identifications, our information will be excluded from the Sumas Index, which is particularly problematic with Sumas already being a relatively illiquid point.  On the other hand, if we do provide counterparty identification, we run the risk of breaching confidentiality obligations, business policies/practices and upsetting our trading counterparties. I guess we have two alternatives, one is to continue to not disclose counterparty identifications and hope that Inside F.E.R.C. will change its view on this (although, as I mentioned, their position is that Houston provides them with that information), or provide counterparty identifications at the risk of getting offside our counterparties. My preference would be to do the former, but I think this is a matter you may want to review with Lavo and let me know how Houston intends to proceed. Regards, Peter 
Glad to have you as an employee of Enron!   Mark Steve C Hall/ENRON@enronXgate 06/01/2001 01:38 PM 
Mark, This article confirms your skepticism about the CDWR deal.  Davis is already planning to violate confidentiality provisions of CDWR contracts signed earlier this year.  The State of California simply cannot be trusted to honor its agreements. Look at Davis's spin on breaching contract provisions:  State negotiators ""worried little about the [confidentiality] clauses"" in their haste to sign the contracts, but now, ""administration officials insisted they are

Attached is a draft arbitration demand our outside counsel has prepared on the confidentiality issue only.  For what it is worth, outside counsel does have some concerns with just arbitrating the confidentiality issue. First, they raise the possibility that by only raising the confidentiality issue, we might be waiving the guaranty assignability issue. To try to prevent this argument, you will note that we have put preservation language in the arbitration statement of claim.  We will need to do some additional legal research to make sure that would do the trick.  Second, outside counsel tends to think the two claims together (confidentiality and the guarantee assignability) work better together.  Let's talk soon. - Letter to Timothy D. Bourn.DOC

We are currently in the process of organizing a small working group to further push our initiative in that market.

After our discussion this afternoon, I have given some additional thought -- and talked to outside counsel -- about the negative potential consequences of filing an arbitration against El Paso.  While I think we should accept the risks, here they are all from our vantage point: First, El Paso could move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim the Guaranty Agreements do not follow. Second, we could lose on our claims.  This would give El Paso the right to move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim the Guaranty Agreements do not follow. Third, El Paso could fight us on the arbitrability of the Guaranty Agreement claim.  We could end up with two proceedings -- our arbitration and a court proceeding El Paso initiates on the Guaranty Agreement claim. Unfortunately, El Paso would have the opportunity to choose the forum on the Guaranty Agreement claim. Fourth, El Paso could counterclaim on the breach of the confidentiality provision.  I think they would have a good argument that we have breached that provision by showing the Swap Agreements etc. to people outside the company such as our bankers.  I am not clear what damages they could claim based on that alleged breach. I haven't heard anything to suggest there are other claims out there for El Paso to assert, but we haven't done much investigating in that area either. I suppose if El Paso got really mad, they might look back over the negotiations in this deal and others to see if they have any other claims they could construct. Andy

1.  Enron Online Trading -- organized a legal team and solved enforceability and documentation issues around the world in a few short months for all the commodities traded by Enron. 2.  Developing New Businesses -- major contributions in developing and structuring coal, insurance, band-width and power plant transactions.  The groundwork has been laid to develop very profitable businesses in each of these areas. 3.  Aggressive Pursuit of Litigation Claims as a Plaintiff -- pursued Carolina Power & Light , Shell/Meridian, TVA, Ft. James and many others. Most have already settled with excellent results.  Successfully defended Wolfschlager, the last Panhandle case and Jolen. 4.  Lead Power Industry to Develop Master Power Agreement -- ENA lead the Edison Electric Institute coalition in developing  the first master power agreement.  ENA will benefit greatly in terms of dramatically lower transaction costs and greater liquidity. 5.  Reduced Legal Costs as Percentage of Earnings -- brought overall legal costs to less than 6% of EBIT in 1999, down from 8% in 1998, despite the upsurge in origination activity. 6.  Brought Finance and Corporate Legal Talent to Origination Deals -- as the origination work expanded dramatically and became much more complex, brought in more sophisticated legal talent to deals like UI and Peoples with great success. 7.  New Concept to Better Manage and Communicate Legal Risks -- developed the legal risk book concept to highlight where the largest buckets of legal

Mark, In a week or so Enron Global Exploration & Production will make a pitch to Korea National Oil Corporation amounting to a comprehensive proposal to provide various oil- and gas-field services to KNOC, plus offer the opportunity to provide financing, risk management and other Enron-type things.

Cedric Burgher, the CFO of Enron Global E&P, has, in the message below, sought my help with language to make the financing pitch as strong as possible but at the same time not binding on Enron. Can you look at this and offer any comments or suggestions, or have someone in the legal group of ENA respond?  I would really appreciate it. Thanks. Stephen Wallace.

More importantly, Goldman moved one of its top traders worldwide, Tom Montag, from London to Tokyo and is generally beefing up the resources in Japan.  IBJ has contacted me about energy trading and asked for copies of confirms and says there is growing interest in the market place.  That's all I can think of for now. Take care,

I agree and am copying this message to Mark and Jeff- Thanks. 
I sent you along yesterday a copy of the e-mail re the participation by Rob and me in the seminars that Blakes is doing for the traders and originators in Canada.  Thinking about it more this morning, I am wondering whether the seminars that Sullivan & Cromwell are doing in the US are too narrow in their  focus.  That is, it is important for traders not merely to understand the competition/anti-trust rules but also  the rules and practices of the market surveillance panels or committees that operate, I think, in each of the ISO jurisdictions.   It is that piece that Rob and I will be  trying to add in Canada.  Just a thought in case you want to raise it withJeff Hodge or Mark Haedicke.

Please provide your comments to me as soon as you can.  The most important thing at this point is to make sure I have the business correctly described. I am working on the letter of intent now.

There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.  The idea would be to talk about e-commerce in the energy business.  Specifically, Enron might propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.  We would probably discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA. What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting? What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting? Should legal counsel be in attendance? 
Jeff, please review and let's talk about it.  Mark

In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of thing,ie. is this some kind of ""illegality"" issue?  I am working on the second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue, I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy 
Puget Sound has filed a complaint against all jurisdictional sellers of wholesale energy and/or capacity in the Pacific Northwest, including parties to WSPP agreement.  Puget Sound requests FERC to impose price cap on wholesale sales of energy and capacity in the Pacific Northwest equal to the lowest price cap ""established, ordered, or permitted by the Commission for wholesale purchases by the Cal ISO or Cal PX . . . .""  Puget requests an effective date of December 25,2000.

Seth: There is a new senior person that was just hired in Japan to be the head of the office.  You should find out that person's name and try to meet with that person in Japan as soon as you can.  I think Enron should try to steer one of the committees to focus on energy regulatory matters in a material way.  I am not sure what committtee that would be at this point.  I think you should have this conversation with the senior person and I will work on it at the board level. Let's keep comparing notes. Regards, 
I am ok with all the changes except the deletion of the last sentence in paragraph 1.  I don't understand why Abitibi-Consolidated deleted that sentence.

Great conference in Amsterdam.  It was the best one yet.  I would like to have an IDSA sponsored energy conference in Houston sometime in the next year.  I think the time will be ripe to focus on (a)  energy derivatives around the world and (b) the application of web technology to energy.   If we do it right, we may draw a large group internationally and build our membership dramatically.  Let me know what you think. Regards, 
Peter: I think your collective e-mails constitute the legal risk memo.  What do you think the legal risk rating ought to be? Regards, Mark Peter Keohane 11/22/2000 10:28 AM 
Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following (together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the extent a risk memo is required. In terms of unusual risks: 1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master. However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds. 2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron Corp.'s creditworthiness. 3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the volume purchased is not properly hedged. 4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk (as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete control of whether or not we can comply with the rules. Peter. (Milly, sorry for not copying you on my first memo - see below.) 
Please get the lunch on my schedule and book me to take them on a tour of the trading floor.  Mark 
On Tuesday, April 11th the Chairman of Milbank, Tweed-- Mel M. Immergut,--and two of his partners who have done a considerable amount of work for Enron---Ed Feo and Eric Silverman --- are coming to Houston to pay us a courtesy visit.  I will host a lunch for them to which you are hereby invited.  Following lunch, they would like to visit with you or your designees to better acquaint themselves with the breadth of Enron's legal needs.  It might also  be useful for them to take a tour of one of our trading floors.  Please let me know if you are available to have lunch with us on the 11th and to spend perhaps 45 minutes with them sometime between the end of lunch and 5:30 p.m. discussing your group. Thank you.

What is the status of our discussions with Carlos?   Mark 
Mark,  although I will hate to lose  Carlos and everyone here at EECC and NEPCO wants him to stay, in point of fact he has repaid his debt to society and is entitled to look at opportunites outside of EECC now. Please feel free to talk with him. He is discussing matters with Vicki et al now, and  she is aware that he will be contacting ENA (EWS?)as well. As background, it was understood at the time we took Carlos on board that his long term career interests were not limited to our construction work, and, consistent with his resume, I have kept him mostly focused on our equity and finance related matters (including work-outs).  I do think well of Carlos, and certainly believe that he is a lawyer that Enron wants to keep. Carlos Sole 12/01/2000 09:36 AM 
Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

For your review -- the latest diagram for the paper website.  Michael, I am free to discuss this at your convenience.  I am hopeful this structure will be unregulated in Europe as well.  Mark 
Based on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business methods that may be novel from a patent point of view: 1.   our site is offering ""prime"" paper rather than seconds or ends 2.   credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost to customers 3.   customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk on physical paper products 4.   customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on prime offerings Please give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy. 
George, I think your proposal is a good one in light of all the facts at hand.  I think it is best if we take the high road in approach as you have proposed.  I would ask Robert to prepare a one page bullet list of your points and then let's all briefly review it.

At Sean's request I had lunch today with Bill Urquhart and Lamont Jones, who are with Quinn Emanuel in L.A.  Quinn Emanuel is a litigation firm of approximately 100 attorneys based in L..A.  Their client list and litigation record are impressive.  From what I have read and heard, they strike me as the ""Susman Godfrey"" of L.A. (and could be even better).    Bill worked with Jonathan Sumption on an arbitration, they became friends, and now whenever Bill is in London he stays in Sumption's home.  I think we should keep the firm in mind for California litigation and international arbitrations.

What is your global strategy? How will you implement it? Global eCommerce Law & Business Report can help net market makers answer these questions with rich monthly analyses of legal and regulatory issues, best business practices, and the barriers and opportunities that exist in regions around the world. In our latest issue, for example, we provide a detailed evaluation of content regulation, privacy, electronic signatures, and consumer regulation which e-commerce marketers in Japan must consider. Next month, look for a review of the regulatory environment in China. Also in the current issue, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group explores Latin America's fast growing Internet market, which is expected to more than double by 2003. Venture capital funds are funneling billions of dollars into enterprises in the region, and global players like Microsoft, AOL, and Telefonica of Spain are making substantial acquisitions.

That is a very interesting question.  I think we would eventually want to include derivatives in the cross default trigger because of their significance.  However, since we often have the far larger derivative position, it would seem at least now, this would more often work against us.

As discussed Michael 
A quick brief on the key people I have met to date follows below.  Fiona, please pull together bios on each of Enron's team members and current job assignments at Enron and forward to Sid and John so they can know who they are dealing with - - - take a little of the mystery out of first engagements!  I will forward a hardcopy diagram of the Enron/MG plc Integration plan - - - John Gill.  John's role as Assistant to the Executive is a senior commercial position.  He was recruited + hired by MG from GE Capital and has extensive experience in M+A activities.  He is assigned to MG's merchanting division and is a relatively recent hire.  I believe he has been actively involved in recruiting a 9 person structured finance team.  John, along with Sid Tipples and David Tregar, has been tasked to co-ordinate the Enron/MG integration. Sid Tipples.  Like John Gill, Sid is an Assistant to the Executive working in the financial services division.  I've had limited conversation with him.  He is actively involved in corp development. Howard Carter.  Howard is the Director of Finance in MCC.  He started his career at Anglo Chemical and Ore Co transferring to Philipp Bros when it acquired the majority holding in Anglo Chemicals.  He qualified as an accountant in 1979 and became a Fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants in 1984.  He joined MCC (physical merchanting division) when it was established in 1989.  He talked to me about a ""control"" function that his group performs that sounds somewhat like a combination of Enron's tasks for originators and structurers.  He seems to pick up several functions in the merchanting division and Michael Farmer is keen to keep him in the loop for H/R assessments. David Tregar.  David is the Financial Director.  He was educated at Lancaster University prior to joining Arthur Andersen in 1973.  He became an associate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1976 and  Fellow of the Institute in 1981.  Since leaving AA in 1978, he has worked continuously in commodity trading.  He joined MGAG in 1990 and was appointed Finance Director  of MGL in 1991.  Prior to this he worked for several US brokerage houses.  He is involved in just about everything at MG (risk, compliance, IT, treasury, banking).  Personally, David is very open and friendly. Bernard Page.  Bernard is a long standing employee of MG (since early 1970s) due to retire in October.  He's had various positions of responsibilities. Prior to Enron's offer, he was winding down his career by planning MG's relocation from One America Square to 25 Cannon Street.  Now, it looks like he will be actively involved in relocating their offices to 40 G.  Bernard tends to be a little reticent until engaged in a conversation about MG's business, etc.  He has a solid understanding of the financial services division and an outstanding working knowledge of MG's office system infra-structure - - - if he doesn't know something, he knows where to get the answer.  I get the sense he has known Michael Hutchison for a long, long time. Michael Farmer.  Michael is Managing Director of the merchanting division and has over 30 years experience in the metals industry.  He started his career with A Strauss & Co, a metal exchange broker and tin merchant.  He also worked for two other metal brokers and was formerly Desk Head (copper) for Philipp Brothers.  He jointly set up MCC, which is the (physical) merchanting division of MG, with Dieter Boettcher (Tom's father/uncle/relative???) who has subsequently retired.  Michael kindly explained the physical metals business to me and we immediately started connecting on commercial project development opportunities, particularly in copper. Michael Hutchison.  Michael is the Managing Director of the financial services division.  He was educated at Hull University.  He joined MGL in 1971, became a member of the Board of Directors in 1982, was appointed Joint Managing Director in 1984, and became Managing Director in 1995.  Between 1984 and 1988, Michael was a committee member of the LME and from 1990 has served as a Director of the LME.  Michael is a very articulate, action-oriented trader, who just wants to get on with it.  Having said that, he has been very patient and careful in explaining the financial markets to me and has provided me with a lot of resources (videos, books, brochures, reports) on the industry. Hamish Scutt.  Hamish was a banker with Kleinwort Benson for 18 years and developed a strong relationship with MG during the latter part, which led to him being recruited and hired ~3 years ago.  He is very interested in promoting a ""credit culture"" that proactively assigns  limits and measures performance.  I get the sense that he has, in his quiet and friendly way, pushed for more credit control in a productive fashion - - - he wants to avoid adversarial relationships with the metals traders.  He is very open to Enron's ideas about credit and is known by a number of people (Lee Munden, Steve Young) at Enron. Tom McKeever.  Tom is the Executive Chairman and has been involved in the metals industry for over 22 years.  He joined MG in 1994 when he became responsible for the Group's US operations.  His experience with public companies (Amax) as a manager and director made him a very credible manager for MG during their IPO and period of public holding.  He lends stability and balance to the executive team.  He is very practical; for example, he wants to know who from Enron is going to contact MG staff - - - he doesn't want them, in their enthusiasm to be open with Enron, to reveal proprietary information to an unscrupulous competitor posing as Enron! Tom Boettcher.  Tom joined MGAG in 1993 as a Vice President of the Metal Division, Head of Copper.  He became a Director of MCC in 1995.  Prior to joining MGAG he worked for 12 years as Head of Metal Department (Prokurist) at Norrdeutsche Affinerie.  I have only had limited discussion with Tom - - - he is preparing a list of development prospects based on a conversation I had with Michael Farmer. Kevin Rhodes.  Kevin is the Director of Operations for the financial service division where he is responsible for the Administration department which encompasses all aspect of back-office and trader support systems.  He joined the Henry Bath (the warehousing company) from university and joined MGL when it took over Henry Bath in 1992.  I have not met Kevin, yet. Timothy Jones.  Tim is the Director of Trading for the financial services division.  He joined MGL in 1980.  He was educated at Homefield College, Christchurch, and started with MGL as a trainee trader.  He has been MGL's Senior Trader for several years.  He was appointed a Director of MGL in 1995 and is a member of the LME Ring Committee.  I have not met Tim, yet.

Neil, Mark Haedicke is an ISDA Board member and works for Enron Corporation.  Mark is going to be in NY next Wednesday with two other colleagues visiting NY banks to discuss automating the derivatives back office and STP.  Would you be available to meet with Mark and me from 1:30 to 3:00 at 270 Park. I've cc'd Mark on this in order to cut out the telephone tag if that time isn't good for you.  I am available all next Wednesday and they are visiting JPM from 10:00 to 12:00. Dennis 
Cliff, please find the legal opinion we previously discussed.  Mark 
Mark-    I'd like to invite you to pareticipate in the newly formed Houston Chapter of the Texas General Counsel Forum.  GC and their direct reports are the targeted membership and the organization has been very successful in Dallas.  Led by several local GC and supported by only a few large law and accounting firms, the Houston effort is just beginning.  Current participants include Chase, Reliant Energy, Compaq, Texaco, Equiva, American General, Sterling Bankshares and others. A breakfast meeting is scheduled for June 13 at the Doubletree in Allen Center at 8:00 a.m. in the Granger A conference room.  Each organizer is inviting two guests and I hope you can be one of mine.  Of course,  we would also like Jim to participate and membership is open to all GC or their direct reports in a company. Vince may visit with Jim about this group. I have copied below a blurb desciribing the TGCF and membership plans. Let me know by phone or email.  Thank you very much. I just got back form 6 rounds of golf in 3 days at the Inn of the Mountain Gods in Ruidoso. And a little time in the casino. Have you played there? My game can be desrcibed as "" arguably improving early beginner"", says the rest of the foursome. The Texas General Counsel Forum is an organization whose mission is to facilitate communication and information sharing among general counsel and outside counsel of best practices for legal department management and for effective communication between the legal department and executive management. Membership is open to general counsel and their direct reports with management responsibility for legal affairs of their companies, and to select outside counsel who provide services to corporate legal departments. Directors and members of the Forum will be present to discuss the organization's goals, purpose and activities. Information about up -coming events and membership applications will be available. 
Don: I would like to attend with you.  I will check with my assistant to make sure I can do it. Take care, 
Bob: After last year it is a close call, but I want to do it again.  I am willing to go for one-half again but am ok with only a quarter of the games.  Let me know when you need the money and I will scout around to see if anyone wants a quarter of the games. 
Janet, I received your message and heard you loud and clear.  We need to diversify the talent working on your deals.  Let's get you together with Julia next week to discuss. Janet R Dietrich 06/06/00 04:01 PM 
I just heard that Chris Gaffney is transferring to the Toronto office. His skill sets/capabilities have been critical in the closing of both the UI and NSTAR deals and he has been actively engaged in the long-term NSTAR deal, Con-Ed, and our Project Green Jacket. It is critical to our business to have no transitional period with attorneys and I expect his replacement to be fully up to speed (i.e. knowledge of the power market, understanding of structured power transactions, etc) relative to definitive documents around these transactions. Chris is definitely a loss to our team. Please advise as to his qualified replacement on these specific deals.  Thanks. 
Mark, what has been mandated by AA and what is your recommendation.  Mark

ISDA PRESS REPORT, THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2000 * US Regulators Find Flaws In Commodities Overhaul Bill - Capital Markets Report, 6/14/00 * Japan Online Power Trading May Spark More Deregulation - Dow Jones Energy Service, 6/15/00 * Philippines Relaxes Banks' Requirement To Raise Capital - The Wall Street Journal Europe, 6/14/00 * Danger Signs - The Economist, 6/10/00 Capital Markets Report, 6/14/00 US Regulators Find Flaws in Commodities Overhaul Bill By Dawn Kopecki WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. financial regulators at a hearing Wednesday faulted legislation aiming at rewriting the nation's commodities laws for going too far in some areas at streamlining the laws overseeing derivatives products and futures markets. Some officials criticized the bill, introduced by Rep. Thomas Ewing, R-Ill., chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management, for diminishing the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission over certain derivatives products. The legislation, as well as a companion bill introduced by Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind., would streamline the laws overseeing derivatives products and futures markets as well as deregulate some aspects of that industry. Lawmakers have been struggling all year to revamp those markets. The Commodity Exchange Act - which expires Sept. 30 - determines which agency, the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has jurisdiction over what derivatives products. A tugging war between the two agencies over how to redraw those lines has slowed progress on the legislation. Annette Nazareth, director of the SEC's division of market regulation, faulted Ewing's legislation for creating a new kind of deregulated futures trading facility, but then giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over the securities traded on those new facilities. ""The (SEC) does not believe that there is a justification for eliminating the traditional role of other regulators, including the SEC, in regulating markets and intermediaries that trade such government securities and other products,"" Nazareth said in written testimony. She noted that it's especially important that the SEC retain its authority ""when these products would be traded on facilities subject to even fewer 
Rick: As you know, Clinton should sign, over the next couple of days, legislation on electronic signatures.  There is a big need to standardize the approach with respect to e-signatures on trading contracts and maybe confirmations.  I think this is an area that ISDA could provide leadership and possibly make money through a protocol.  Let me know what you think. 
Bob: I think the RFP looks great.  The one question I had was whether or not we wanted to put in the RFP our objective in terms of income from the facility. Also, should we encourage joint bids?  Take care. 
Peter: At this point, it seems to me, it may be helpful, but not materially helpful to bid through a separate entity.  Do you disagree with this conclusion? 
Lance, it looks fine to me with exception of the reference to Kinneman. 
Please look at this and give me your comments.  Mark 
Mr. Haedicke, My name is Shari Fleishman.  I am an attorney with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. in Washington, D.C., and I was referred to you by Charles Moore. Thank you for agreeing to help us arrange interviews with Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford.  To give you some background, we are representing Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. in a breach of contract dispute with Central Resources, Inc. regarding losses and costs resulting from Central's alleged default of its obligations under the terms of natural gas and crude oil swap and swaption transactions.  Statoil alleges that Central did not provide the credit assurances required once it exceeded its credit limit, so Statoil terminated the transactions.  During negotiations, however, prior to termination, Central and Statoil were negotiating with Enron regarding a possible assignment of the transactions to Enron.  This was not consummated, but we would be inquiring into the circumstances surrounding the proposed assignment.  We would like to interview Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford regarding these discussions concerning the potential assignment, in o! rder to evaluate whether there is any need to depose either of these individuals. Please let me know if you need anything further, and again, I appreciate your cooperation in arranging these interviews.  You can call me at 202-887-4387, or e-mail me, to discuss arrangements.

Steve: Attached is a series of press releases by MG Plc regarding their metals website, the first of which was launched on or about October 4, 1999. I also have a message in to the attorneys at Enron that worked closely on the acquisition, but one of our commercial people understands the site to be an on-line brokerage system (like E*Trade) -- the press release on the launch of the system (at the bottom of this message) indicates that the site is an LME trading and execution system.

Bob: We are working on a ""protocol"" re electronic signatures.  Is this something isda would want to be involved in?  Maybe money could be made.  Let me know. Mark 
Mark: Pursuant to our discussion last week, below is a rough draft of a proposal for an electronic signature protocol, which could be presented to ISDA for further consideration and discussion after we have further discussed: E-Signature Protocol Objective: In light of the enactment of the US federal legislation on electronic signatures (effective as of 10/1/00), a simple, reliable, and enforceable protocol should be established to facilitate the electronic execution of Master Agreements (and confirmations where required).  To facilitate the wider use of electronic contracts, this protocol could be endorsed by ISDA. Hopefully, it would become a standard that others would use for all types of contracts. Perhaps, if necessary or helpful, the adoption of the protocol could be done electronically by each party unilaterally agreeing to abide by it, possibly using the same type of approach ISDA used in connection with the introduction of the EMU currency a few years ago. Initially, the protocol would be primarily applicable to U.S. counterparties, but it could be expanded to non-U.S. counterparties as e-signature laws like the new U.S. law are enacted across the globe. Basic Protocol:  By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the following steps: 1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement, and appoint one of the parties (""First Party"") to prepare the document for electronic signature; 2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement; 3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in his/her name and title in the blank signature block); 4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party (""Second Party""); 5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party  electronically signs the agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in his/her name and title in the signature block); 6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party, accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and 7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties. Also, the following could be considered: (a) adding to the protocol that each party,by adopting the protocol, agrees to be bound by any agreement entered into by means of the protocol, and any other appropriate language to enhance the enforceability of the ""e-signature"" process and (b) adding to the preprinted form of the Master Agreement, a provision whereby each party adopts the electronic signature protocol endorsed by ISDA as in effect from time to time.

Gary There follows a summary of the key information required in order to be able to estimate, under SFA capital rules, the likely regulatory capital requirements of the proposed bond and equity trading businesses in London. The summary has been prepared by Andy Cornfield who is our resident expert on the SFA's capital rules. As previously discussed, EEFT - our SFA regulated agent through which we currently propose to run this business - is subject only to very modest regulatory capital rules since it does not take any principal positions.  Our view, however, is that a bond and equity trading desk of the type discussed will (sooner or later) become subject to SFA capital requirements and so it makes sense now to estimate the likely extent of that capital. It would be very helpful at this stage if you (or someone in your group) could provide a guestimate (based on the US model, but modified where you think the European positions might be different) of the likely volumes and constituent parts of these businesses: after 12 months of trading after 24 months of trading after 36 months of trading Please contact Andy or myself if you would like to discuss this. I look forward to hearing from you. Best regards Paul

FYI on the lawyers conference.  Mark 
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows. ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo. The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval. Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events. 1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and ENA. 3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form. 4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of the Chairman for final approval. Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts. If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978. Thank you for your cooperation.

I would envision getting up to speed on business opportunities in Ontario and addressing the questions you raised.  Your proposal makes sense, but I would like to defer our decision until we have had a chance to talk it through. 
Yes, Michael raised it to me, so that is all clear.  With respect to the candidate you mentioned, I think I would need to review his resume and see what the arguments would be.  Let's get together and talk about this before you go to the recruiters. 
Rosemary: Yes, I would be happy to.  I would like to get some time on the schedule to review the plan for energy both in North America and Europe.  It seems to me that we ought to have a meeting in Frankfurt in Sept and a seminar on energy in Houston over the next six months. 
Please add this to my schedule.  Maybe, I can fly to Toronto the next day. Ask Chris Gaffney if September 21 works for him instead of the dates I proposed in August.   Mark 
Mark, As you may know the ISDA Members Update and E-Commerce Forum will be held in New York on September 20. The morning session will be devoted to committee updates and the afternoon to e-commerce. Would you be available to give a 10 minute update on the activities of the Energy Committee. Look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Rosemary 212 332 2555 
Chris: 
Please review the attached summary of legal risks. 
In preparation for our meeting on Monday, I listed the key legal issues re the PPAs. 
I think you need to do their reviews.  I would coordinate with Jeff Hodge to

Alan, are we doing anything on Aer*x anymore?  Please let Mark Holsworth know.   Mark 
I understand from the Corporate Secretary that AER*X Inc. was a subsidiary of Enron Power Services.  AER*X Inc. has been dissolved according to the Corporate Secretary in 1994.  This company owned the mark AER*XTERT which subsequently was assigned to Enron Power Services.  As I said in my previous message, the mark is up for renewal.  Are we using the mark and if not, there would be no basis to renew it.  Can you please help me? 
personal data 
What topics do you think would be appropriate?  I will have just a few minutes.  I was thinking CFTC, electronic trading, physical trading forms and continued opening of power markets in North America to trading. Mark 
Mark, We are putting together the brochure for the Members Update in London and New York.  We would like to list the topics to be covered during each presentation in bullet points on the agenda.   What topics would you suggest we list for Energy. Thanks in advance for your help. Regards, Rosemary 
We should include ISDA energy definitions, CFTC matters re energy and an overview of power deregulation developments in North America.  I might also add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power trading form.  I am thinking 4 slides at the most.  Is that what you want? 
Michael: The September ISDA meeting is coming up and I am starting to plan my schedule.  I will be in London on Monday and Tuesday, Sept 12 and 13.  I will also be in Frankfurt on Wednesday and Thursday.  Are you free for dinner on either Monday or Tuesday?  Who is the best person in Frankfurt to give me an overview of the trading markets in Germany? Regards, 
Jane: There are lots of countries that at first did not allow derivatives and later changed the laws to allow them.  Bob Pickel, the GC of ISDA in NYC could give you info on this or Jeff Golden at Allen & Overy in London could give you info.

Dear Mike, Per direction from Cathy Phillips, here is the information about The Patent & License Exchange (pl-x), and its potential role in Enron's e-commerce/exchange initiative. The Patent & License Exchange, Inc. (www.pl-x.com), since Jan 1999 has been the operator of the safest global marketplace for intellectual property rights.  pl-x promotes liquidity in the market through novel financially-oriented content and risk transfer tools backed by world-class companies. Strategic partners include Ernst & Young, Swiss Re, and Chicago Title Company (NYSE: FNF).  pl-x's most recent round of financing brought in $30 million in March, from a 10-member syndicate including Softbank, Polytechnos, Texas Pacific Group and TMCT Ventures.  The Board of Directors includes the most recent Commissioner of the US Patent and Trademark Office, Bruce Lehman and former Managing Director of Mitsubishi Electric Company, Takashi Kiuchi.  Subscribers include Avery Dennison, Dow Chemical, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Mallinckrodt, Aventis, Gateway, Honeywell, and over 190 others. pl-x also just received the Forbes.com ""Best of the Web"" award: http://www.forbesbest.com/b2b/asp/tearsheet.asp?reviewNO=1738&industry=Miscell aneous Enron's leadership role in the growth of online exchanges is becoming clear. We believe leadership in the Intellectual Property Asset Exchange space would be consistent with Enron's vision, and we look forward to speaking about ways of potentially working together.

1.  Legal Risk Report -- developed the concept of the legal risk report for ECT.  I began reporting and managing the ECT legal risks on that basis.  This resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract risks.  There will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on transactions and faster focus on solving problems. 2.   Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy  --  in the face of almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT.  The traders and originators helped design the policy and have ""bought in"".  Training was completed in June.  This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information. 3.  Lead power industry to develop a standardized form  --  pushed ISDA and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master trading form for power.  The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after the ECT form.  The result will be a significant saving of legal time and effort and more transactions will be completed in the industry with less risk of an unintended default. 4.  Cutting edge legal work -- identified and solved many cutting edge legal questions in connection with the start-up of many ECT businesses. These businesses include (i) the acquisition of competitive information, (ii) weather, coal, emissions, band- width and electronic trading, and (iii) acquisition of businesses through contract such as contemplated in the UI and the Peoples deals. 5.  Carolina Power & Light -- after filing suit against CP&L, acheiving a settlement at 90% of the value, despite difficult legal issues. 6.  Deals are Us  --  lots and lots of deals done.  Legal built a closer relationship with several difficult groups with improved results for the

Mark: A concern has been raised about IT service providers working on EOL or other Enron projects and then taking know-how to a competitor, such as Dynegy. Since these service providers tend to work for a lot of different companies, it seems like this is a significant issue.  How do we address this risk in the contracts? Do we need to add a non-competition clause? 
Ron: Thanks for your help.  Let's get together for lunch some time.  Let me know what works for you. 
NIck: Do we have an erergy meeting scheduled in September.  Let's talk about this. We could do it in either London or Frankfurt doing the week of the board meeting.   Let me know your thoughts on this. 
Rick: Thanks for the message.  I have sent an e-mail to Nick.  I will coordinate with him. 
Paul: Thanks for the e-mail.  I agree with your assessment.  I also want to thank you for your support of the legal department.  We feel like we are part of the team and I appreciate your efforts in that regard. Take care,

Charles, the article looks very good to me.  I could not open the exhibits. 
It seems to me that our standard language should prohibit service providers from working on any similar project for a competitor or disclosing in any way that work was done for Enron.  Also, we may want to specify liquidated damages for violation of this covenant.  Any objections to this? 
Jay: You and I can talk through the issues.  The key point is that you have to vote the best interest of the corporation on whose board you sit and not your personal interest or the interest of Enron.  Give me a call and we can talk through the business of Convergent and what the risks are. 
Mark: Would you please propose language to me along the lines I suggested.  Thanks. 
Please take this comment into account when you draft up some language. Thanks, Mark 
I agree completely. However, we probably need to develop language that defines an Enron competitor, as people will ask and we are considerably

Jim: Per our conversations, I propose the following additions to your draft memo: Global Trading --  All lawyers providing legal services for trading activities (anywhere in the world) will continue to be consolidated into one group reporting to Mark Haedicke. Legal Risk Books -- Mark will undertake an Enron-wide long term project to categorize legal risks into standardized risk ""books"".  To that end, Mark will form a team to work closely with each General Counsel or her/his designee regarding the significant legal risks in each subsidiary company. The goal will be to help us better understand our legal risks on a consolidated basis and to provide additional tools to manage our legal risks day to day.  It is anticipated that a consolidated monthly legal risk report

FYI , some interesting issues on the new exchange . Michael 
Joe, Further to our discussion yesterday, when you mentioned that you wished to commence trading on the EEX Spot Market on and from Wednesday 9th August, I set out below the main elements of legal risk, as I see them, in the various elements of the Exchange Rules.  You should note as a general matter that the Exchange Rules are largely vague and ambiguous which only heightens the potential legal legal risk. The Counterparty to our trades Enron's counterparties to trades will be the individual market participants with whom our bids and offers get matched - our counterparty will not be the Exchange itself or a clearing house. We shall only be told the identity of the counterparty(ies) with whom we have neen matched after that matching process has occurred.  There is no mechanism to filter counterparties based on credit quality, types of counterparty etc. Hence, there is no effective credit control left to trading participants over whom they should do deals with. Collateral Arrangements As far as security by way of collateral for trading exposures among the participants is concerned, initial collateral of Euros 100,000 is posted with the Exchange in one of the prescribed methods (bank guarantee, cash,etc) via one's ""clearing"" bank.  The Exchange will monitor the exposures of all the counterparties and can require more collateral to be posted overnight, on a variation margin basis, if a counterparty is exposed over the level of collateral previously posted.  Note that the collateral which the Exchange may require to be posted does not seem to include cover for any unpaid amounts where a participant has not paid for power delivered - it appears that it will only cover the mark-to-market value of deals struck on the Exchange which remain outstanding (i.e., pre-delivery) In terms of the amount of collateral required to be posted, it would appear that each trade will be calculated on a gross, rather a net, basis (even for buys and sells with the same counterparty and not just trades with different counterparties).  The rules are very vague here.  I would suggest that your traders and RAC touch base on this issue and understand - by speaking to the Exchange if necessary - exactly the methodology of calculating our collateral posting requirement. Whilst the Exchange will monitor the participants' exposures and call for margin from the Participants' clearing banks as appropriate, there is an obligation imposed on each participant itself to be able itself to monitor its own exposures and its own collateral posting requirement.  It is unclear whether the Exchange has provided sufficient information in relation to the model to be used to enable us to fulfill this requirement.  I suggest that back office and RAC look into this immediately in conjunction with your trading staff.  Technically we can have our membership suspended if we do not comply with the Rules; more importantly,  from a good buisness practice perspective, we should be able to comply with the rules plus be able to know these figures each day.   RAC and your traders should therefore check that we can do this immediately. In the event that a counterparty defaults, there are two points to note. Firstly, what constitutes a default is unclear.  The Rules state that a default is where a counterparty is, to quote, ""unable"" to meet its obligations under the Rules.  Strictly, inability (e.g., insolvency) would not cover unwillingness (e.g.,, counterparty can pay but does not wish to pay for whatever reason).  Clifford Chance Germany have advised me that they feel that a German court would stretch the meaning to include unwillingness to meet obligations  but, of course, point out that this would be for a judge ultimately to decide. Secondly,  even if a counterparty is in default as defined, there is no absolute legal obligation on the EEX to realise / call upon the collateral posted with it.  This will depend upon whether the management board of the EEX exercsies a discretion to instruct the EEX to do so.  In my view. the Exchange could well take the view that as the trades are a matter between the individual participants (as the Exchange is not the counterparty), the Exchange may well be unwilling to realise collateral until the outcome of arbitration between the parties to a dispute.  Clearly this could be a number of weeks or months after the non-payment dispute arose and hence increasing our credit risk.  Please note that there is no clear recourse to the Exchange in the event that the Exchange itself refuses to realise collateral. If the Exchange does realise the collateral however, it will hold it for the benefit of all Participants.  Note, however, that this does not seem to cover previously unpaid amounts as mentioned above. Taxes End consumers can be participants on the Exchange.  As this is the case, if we get matched with an end consumer, then apparently we open ourselves up to potential liability to pay German energy taxes.   Clifford Chance have advise me that, whilst this remains an unresolved issue, apparently the German fiscal authorities appear only to ensure that German-based entities pay such tax, rather than foreign-based ones such as ECTRL, which is our trading participant.  If you require further details on this, please refer to Tina Ward in Tax Department. Renewable Energy Sources Act. Again, if we, as a seller, were matched with an end-consumer, then under this Act we are obliged to ensure that we source approximately 3.45% of the energy sold from a renewable source.  I understand that this is approximately 4 times as expensive as normal domestic power, coming in at around 16.75 pfennigs per kWh.  It is entirely unclear how this will be monitored and enforced in respect of dealings on the Exchange, although Cliffords' view is that this will be done in some way through the Balancing mechanism.  May be your traders should look into this in greater detail, should it be of concern. Settlement On a purely logistical level, for your general information, please note that physical power delivery is T+1, whereas Buyer settles T+2. The Exchange states that bills from sellers to buyers will go to the buyers via the Exchnage.  It is unclear how the mechanics of this work (they are not dealt with in the Rules to any greater extent).  I would suggest that your trading staff and our settlements staff look into this immediately, by speaking directly to the Exchange if necessary.  It should also be borne in mind that I assume that invoices will have to raised and issued within the T+2 framework. IMPORTANT NOTE: Clearly we want eventually to put this trading participation thorough a formal and final CACs  process (the rules have totally altered since we CACs'd it last time three weeks ago).  However, I understand that you would like to be able to trade from tomorrow, which will be a few days in advance of the CACs  process (additional rules in German have only just been sent to me, and hence I cannot tell you at present what is the import of these).  In this respect, please note that ECTRL is joining as a Market-Maker and hence, under the Exchange Rules, if you wish to proceed, we would have the obligation from tomorrow to quote firm two way prices during normal market opening hours.  The Exchange can promulgate rules prescribing the length of time for which bids / offers are active, minimum / maximum volumes bid / offerred, the width of spreads, etc.,.; I understand from Clifford Chance that the Exchange has not yet prescribed these rules.  What we do know at the moment is that if we fail ""too often"" to quote as a market maker, then the exchange can remove / suspend us as a trading participant.  In order to mitigate your risk at present therefore, you may wish to consider the size of volumes we would quote and width of spreads, etc.., and discuss with RAC and / or Credit beforehand. Finally, I understand that: (a) Dresdner's banking terms for us have still not been agreed (apparently these are being dealt with at an Enron Houston Legal Department level) and therefore I cannot tell you whether Dresdner would be willing to provide the collateral guarantee etc before these are agreed and (b) I understand that the EEX still has some outstanding points re our Balancing arrangements which would need to be finalised before we could trade.  Sandip is in contact with Enron Houston over (a) and I understand that Heribert and Michael Schuh are dealing with the Balancing arrangements. Subject to clearing the items in (a) and (b), and discussing volumes, spread etc with RAC / Credit etc.,  if you wish to proceed tomorrow, please let me know as I shall need to write to the Exchange this afternoon informing them of this (our application forms were submitted under the caveat that we would write to them when we wished our membership to go active). Kind regards Mark

ISDA will soon be in a position to make its documentation available electronically. I know that many of you have been advocating this for awhile so I am happy to say that the day will soon be here. In anticipation of that, I would appreciate your input on how the documentation is made available and, in particular, the pricing of that access. For anyone other than an ISDA member, the documents will be made available in electronic PDF form for purchase on a per document basis. For members, two additional options will be made available for access to interactive versions of the documentation: an internet version and an intranet version. The internet version will consist of the complete library of ISDA documentation in an interactive version also in PDF format. The documents will include internal links within documents (section reference to the section itself, use of a defined term to its definition) as well as links to User's Guides that have been published for a particular document. We propose that the pricing of this option will be on a per user annual fee basis. The intranet option will permit users to take the full library of ISDA documents and place it on a firm's intranet, thereby providing access to anyone within the firm who has access to the intranet. ISDA would charge a fixed annual fee for this service. I would appreciate your responses to the following questions: 1. Ignoring cost, do you think your institution would be more likely to use the internet version of the documents or take them onto your intranet? 2. If you are more likely to use the internet version, how many users would you anticipate worldwide within your institution? 3. For the internet service, would you prefer to pay (a) a high initial fee for the first user (e.g., $5,000) and a small additional fee for each incremental user (e.g., $100) or (b) a lower initial fee (e.g., $3,000) and a larger additional fee for each incremental user (e.g., $500)? Assume for these purposes that the cost of the intranet service is $10,000 per annum. 4. Would your answer to question 3 change if the cost of the intranet service were $15,000? I will not hold you to any of these answers. I just hope to get your input as we proceed to further consideration at the Board level of how electronic delivery of documentation will work and how it will be priced. Thank you for your input.

I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I propose the following: 1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 months 2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only the deal terms at the end of a call The first change could be made immediately and the second change would require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes. 
Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program: 1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary. 2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is being scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further. 
Mark, Thanks for the help.  I have worked with Anne Koehler a number of times in the past; however, since this is specifically Net Works and may be more of an acquisition than an investment, I wasn't sure who to contact.  Please find attached a brief description of the Altra Gas Pipeline Software Business, along with CIBC's Confidentiality Agreement.  I am sure you will have changes to the CA, as a result, I will try to identify the appropriate contact at the bank.  You may want to give me a call and/or Tom Gros to make sure all of his concerns are addressed. Drew x56075 - teaser.doc - enron.doc

I think partnering with a lawfirm would be a good idea re documentation. However, I am not sure the ISDA board is likely to pick a proposal that includes a competitor of the stature of Enron.

Larry: On the resume, only one comment.  I would split out Community Affiliations or just delete it.  I will give the resume to a friend of my in HR and ask where he thinks the best fit would be in Enron.  Do you want me to e-mail your resume to a few people I know in other businesses? If yes, please send again without the note to me. 
I have talked to my friend and the areas where we need help are in coal product and paper product marketing and industrial customer outsourcing. Give me a call and I can describe the opportunities and see what your interest level is. 
Bob: I think Enron is more  likely to use the intranet service.  I was unclear however, if additional service was available in the internet service, such as links to the explanatory books?  I think generally we would want the convenience of having the ISDA materials inside for use by any Enron employee.  If the cost gets too high, I don't think members will pay for it. $10,000 sounds ok to me. Regards, 
Peter: Thanks for the message.   I look forward to getting together. 
David: Per our conversation last week, I have attached a copy of Mr. Lipman's resume.  He has expressed interest in learning more about the coal, paper and steel business opportunities.  He will give you a call at 713-853-3557 to schedule a time to meet. Regards, Mark Haedicke

Mark: It never fails.  Ironically, within an hour after hitting the ""Send"" button on my prior e-mail to you, I got a call from Stephanie, Jim's assistant, informing me that Jim's travel schedule for the first week in September had changed since I had set up the appointment and so we are going to have to reschedule the meeting with him.  Stephanie gave me a couple of possible dates in late Sept. and the middle of October that I need to follow up with Steve and Peter on.  Once I circle back with them, I'll follow up with you to see what may work for you. Since I am scheduled to have a meeting in your offices on the morning of the 7th, I still plan to be in Houston.  Is there a chance that you and I could get together for lunch on the 6th or perhaps catch up for a few minutes that afternoon or the afternoon of the 7th? I'll touch base with you to see what your schedule looks like.  Thanks.

In order to finalize the board composition for the Annual shareholders meeting to be held on April 30 I suggest the following: The board according to the by laws has permanent members (min 4, max 7) and alternates (min 2, max 4).  We are also required to have an employee representative as a permanent member and an alternate.  We would like to have a maximun participation of local residents in order to facilitate board meetings. Permanent members:                            Alternates: Employee rep                                        Employee rep Orlando  Gonzalez                                  Jim Hughes, Joe Kishkill                                               John Novak Rebecca McDonald                                Jeff Sommers Jim Derrick Joao Carlos Albuquerque Britaldo Soares This allows for five local residents and the Houston membership we needed.  I would like your opinion as soon as possible so I can discuss with Rebecca in order to elect the board on April 30th.  Thanks Orlando 
I am ok with your slate, but need some Houston people on board as well.  I think we can shorten the Houston list by taking me off since John Novak will be on the board.  I leave it to Bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the list further.  Mark Orlando Gonzalez@ENRON 03/27/2001 01:51 PM 
Did you  get a chance to review the Elektro board make up.  I would like to finalize before the next ordinary shareholder meeting in Brazil.   Thanks --------------- See attached regarding Elektro's board membership.  We would suggest that the board slate be made up of Brazil residents in order to facilitate the necessary meetings. I would like to include Joe Kishkill, John Novak, Brett Wiggs, Britaldo Soares and Joao Carlos Albuquerque, all members of our executive committee to substitute Rick Waddell, Diomedes, Jim Bannantine, and Rick Lammers.  If  you agree, I will talk to Rebecca to finalize.  Thanks 
Bruce,  This solution does not work for Brazilian entities for legal reasons.    I will send a summary of the current situation and a proposal to resolve. We can discuss during your visit.  Thanks Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 31/01/2001 19:26 
Folks - The Legal Specialists in EGA are working up new director/officer slates for the EGA entities.  We will be appointing the following list of directors for EGA entities: Rebecca McDonald Jim Hughes Jeff Sommers Jim Derrick Mark Haedicke There will be some exceptions to this slate, particularly where local law or the necessity of regular board attendance requires additional (or even different) directors to be appointed.  These will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Allow the Legal Specialists the opportunity to come up with their tentative slates and then we will give them to the regional heads for comment. Some of you will be asked to resign your current directorships.  I hope that no one will take offense to the fact of of the changed slates -- none is intended.  We have found that this common slate has made corporate governance more efficient and less complicated. Thank you for your cooperation.  Please pass this message along to others in your respective groups as you deem necessary. Bruce 
Orlando: As per your request, please find bellow the names of all of the present members of Elektro's Board. Firstly is to be mentioned that according to Elektro's By Laws, the Board may have a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 7 permanent members (one obligatorily must be elected by appointment of Elektros' employees) and a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 alternates (one obligatorily to act solely as alternate to the employees' representative at the Board) Permanent members: Diomedes Christodoulou (President) Orlando Goanz?lez Ricky Linn Waddell Geraldo Gon?alves Pereira (elected by appointment of Elektro's employees) Vacant (3) Alternate members: James Martin Bannantine Richard Allan Lammers Ricardo Louren?o Carneiro (alternate to Geraldo Gon?alves) Vacant (3) The election and/or dismissal of the Board members has to be decided by the shareholders of the company. Normally the election o the Board members takes place at the annual Ordinary Shareholder's meeting. (This year, our OGM is scheduled to take place on April, 29th.) However this matter  can also be decided at any time via an Extraordinary Shareholder's Meeting  that has to be called trough a  Board Resolution that  has to be publicized at the Official Gazette no later than 8 days prior to date of such EGM. Should the present number of the Board members be maintained (i.e 4 permanent and 3 alternates), the election of new members (from our side) will have to be made upon the resignation of those presently on seat. Should you deem necessary, please call me at your earliest convenience. Least but nol east As I vave mentined to you the other day, it is quite normal to appoint the senior legal council as an alternate to the permanent members of the Board so that he may legally be present at all the board meetings 
I agree.  I want to change the reporting to be directly to me anyway.  Let's

A.  Corporate Structure - To facilitate the meshing of EES' existing Canadian affiliate (Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd. (""EES Canada"")) and Enron Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership (""Enron Direct Canada"")), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows: Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada. This will involve: a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.; b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada Corp. to EES Canada; and c.  a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to Enron Direct Canada. By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada, both entities will continue to operate as they do today. As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and (ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is currently. B.  Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related ""permanent establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp. would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp.  Accordingly, Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups. Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian subsidiaries.  In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me; however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume the role. With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron Direct Canada.  With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the interim. Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed on the basis of these proposals. Regards, Mark Powell

We will need to determine if the litigation will affect the viability of PSM as the operator or ENA as owner of the equipment involved in the litigation.

As we discussed at the Board meeting last week, the impetus for a single master agreement will need to come from several fronts, but especially from within each of your firms. The various trade associations will be most responsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a single agreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We will separately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations that sponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financial products that would be covered by such an agreement. The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to this project are the following: Securities Industry Association (US) The Bond Market Association (US) International Securities Market Association (principally Europe) European Banking Federation (Europe) The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo) Emerging Markets Traders Association The following associations may also be helpful to the process: Australian Financial Markets Association British Bankers Association Japan Securities Dealers Association Canadian Bankers Association International Primary Markets Association (London-based) ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_ If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you to discuss as soon as possible with your representative within that organization the need to support the development of a single agreement for financial products and urge them to express their support to the associations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in my memorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached an edited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussions with the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possible approaches for ISDA.

Mr. Haedicke, I'm a new hire and was recently advised to become familiar with the NYMEX.com website.  While I was there, I looked up Enron under NYMEX.com's ""member firms"" section.  I found Enron's name and your name as a contact point.  What was odd though was that although your email address appears correctly as a hyperlink (""mhaedic@ect.enron.com""), I noticed that the actual email reference was to someone at El Paso Energy, ""morrissont@epenergy.com"".  You can see this by right-clicking on the hyperlink and looking at the link's properties.   I believe this will cause emails intended for you to go to El Paso Energy. I don't know how often this link would even be used so this may not be a big deal... If you have any questions I may be reached at extension 53707.

Please propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than one month will be destroyed on that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or Richard Sanders. We are still looking at moving to recording only the deal terms -- but that is a long term project. 
Dan, I would like to have a brief meeting with the team to talk through the list -- to make sure we are all on the same wavelength.  Let's do it soon with the idea we would have another meeting to wrap things up as appropriate.  Mark Dan Lyons 09/25/2000 03:23 PM 
With respect to the laundry list Dave D sent you: 1. Press Releases-the press release has not yet been prepared, but a first draft was worked up by FCEL's consel. Cle Dade and I are going to look at it with respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so. 2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am aware of by separate email..I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on that draft, but nothing has been signed. 3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the initial draft of the ""talking points"" for the disclosure discusison. It is new and has not been discussed internally yet. 4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel.  Kay Mann is handling the ""State"" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be. 5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the purchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will depend upon the timing of the option vesting.  My gut reaction is that we will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.  I do not know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and again request Kay to please advise us on that. It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with the team on this, but I defer to your judgment.  Let me know what you want to do. Dan Mark E Haedicke 09/25/2000 02:31 PM 
Dan, please prepare a list of items you think I should sign off on and then set up a meeting where we can review that list with the whole team.     Mark 
Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward under the structure we have discussed. FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 60MW of orders; - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that call; - the transaction is fully press released immediately. CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW; - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL. I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner. Thanks Delainey

Competition in Asia Pacific Region 
Let me know if you see any problem.  Mark 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region I talked to Mark Frevert and John Sherriff and they are ok with the provision.  Mark Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Sent by: Liz N Martinez@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/25/2000 04:54 PM 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels - At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns. Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2. Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco. The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates. The following is a summary of these competition provisions: Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk management services. There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction. ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix). ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii). It does not include Japan and Australia. The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003. Thank you, Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Mark: Robin Hill gave me your name as a contact for a potential NDA with one of our prospective clients.  Would you please let me know how we would obtain an NDA between i2 and Enron Corp. for this transaction? Please call or e-mail me if you have comments or questions about this.

Robin: This NDA will be between i2 and Enron, not EBS, as you pointed out.  Who do we talk to in order to obtain an NDA with Enron Corp.? Please call or e-mail me if you have questions. Thanks, Mike Robin Hill 09/19/00 09:54 AM 
This NDA is with Enron Corp. and EBS is not permitted to bind Enron Corp. The legal department would like for all potential clients to review our form for execution.  If they present their own form we are happy to review it, however there is almost always terms of their form that need to be negotiated.  Therefore, if they review our form NDA and it is acceptable the process is a lot quicker. Attached is the NDA with EBS and C-Store Matrix to send to them for execution.   Please select the ""Read Only"" option in order to open and print.  Please print 2 originals for signature so each party has an original executed NDA, or you may e-mail it to them as long as they follow up with 2 originals.  After the other party executes it, you will need to get an EBS attorney to initial it before an EBS VP or above can execute it on our behalf.  If you have any questions please call me and please make sure I get an executed original back.  Thanks. Robin L.

Paul: It is true that there is no wall -- however, it is geographically separate. The equity trading is the end portion of the floor.  There are three hallways that go to equity trading, each about 10 feet long.  It would not be possible to hear anything said outside of the equity trading area.  Robert Bruce is working on updating our policy and procedures in Houston and by copy hereof ask him to update you. Paul Simons 09/19/2000 01:53 PM 
Mark Thanks for the enquiry. I've had discussions with Gary this week and am now working out how soft the wall can be in light of that!  I understand from Gary that in Houston the Chinese walls are not as hard as I imagined ie no physical wall or separate security pass system.  Please confirm. Many thanks Paul

I agree and am copying this message to Mark and Jeff- Thanks. 
I sent you along yesterday a copy of the e-mail re the participation by Rob and me in the seminars that Blakes is doing for the traders and originators in Canada.  Thinking about it more this morning, I am wondering whether the seminars that Sullivan & Cromwell are doing in the US are too narrow in their  focus.  That is, it is important for traders not merely to understand the competition/anti-trust rules but also  the rules and practices of the market surveillance panels or committees that operate, I think, in each of the ISO jurisdictions.   It is that piece that Rob and I will be  trying to add in Canada.  Just a thought in case you want to raise it withJeff Hodge or Mark Haedicke.

Should we reconsider this approach given the new organization. E Power interest is in cheap fuel and not the terminal or pipelines. Please advise and I will handle with Carey.

FYI.  I am working on new procedures requiring a ""budget"" for outside counsel on our more complex deals to improve cost control.  Mark 
I have reviewed the O&M Expenses for ENA Legal for month-ended August 31, 2000, as compared to the budgeted amount for the same period.  The overall legal budget was $4,835,184 over budget as of August 31, primarily due to Outside Costs which went over the planned amount by $5,094,838.  The most significant outside costs were incurred in litigation, power plant development, legally intensive deals such as United Illuminating, and misallocated costs for Projects Summer and California.  The Inside Costs were under budget in the amount of $259,654. If you have any questions, please call me at extension 35448. Deb Korkmas Enron North America Corp.

Hi Larry: I think your best shot at Enron would be in paper with Bryan.  I think we got a gift -- I remember Susan saying something.  I am just the Dad!  Everything is going well.  Keep me posted on your job opportunities or if you want me to follow up with anyone here. Mark LDLIPMAN@aol.com 10/02/2000 08:50 PM 
Hi Mark: I heard from Ted Bland last week. He said that George still has not tested the equipment and Bryan has not met with the COO about hiring yet. I am looking forward to an offer coming in this week from a small public company that wants me to develop a new business development group and increase their sales from $10MM to $50MM over the next couple of  years and get the stock price up. I am still operating the fitness company but it is quickly coming to an end due to running out of money so I am looking forward to finding a new position in the next couple of weeks. Everyone is settled into school and doing well. What is new with you and your family? Debbie and I sent you and Susan a gift a month or so ago for having Bryan stay with you. Did you receive it? I look forward to hearing from you. Larry 
Joe: Thanks for the invitation.  I would love to be there but unfortunately I can't make it. 
Does Rob want to meet on Oct 5?  If yes, I want to be done by 10:00.   Mark 
Three things: I attach a copy of the memo on the federal electronic signature law that we discussed this morning.  Mark and I will discuss with Alan his original proposal of adding a footer to company emails and get back to the group. Until then no footer will be added. With respect to Paulette, I understand that each of you agree to bear your proportionate share of her cost for the budget year 2000--although the basis of that allocation is still to be agreed. Finally, we agreed to discuss what projects we would like for our technology committee to undertake.  I propose that we discuss this topic during next Thursday's meeting--since Jim will be out of town we can have this meeting in lieu of the regular meeting.  I think having this discussion now would be helpful and I think the technology group would greatly benefit from the meeting as well.  Let me know if that is acceptable to you. Thanks. 
As I mentioned at our last meeting, we have been working with issues of electronic contracts and signatures in Global Finance, especially in the development, implementation and ongoing operations of the DealBench Internet site.  Vinson & Elkins has been working with us on DealBench and related e-commerce matters.  Attached for your information is a V&E memorandum on electronic contracts and signatures under federal, Delaware, New York, Texas and certain uniform laws. As a postscript to the meeting minutes circulated today, Enron Corp., some of its affiliated entities and third parties successfully are using the DealBench site for various types of transactions. Let me know if I can help or provide additional information on any of these matters. Regards, NJD 
Yes for the choice of law but not for jurisdiction.  We could agree to non-exclusive jurisdiction in Ohio. Mark James Grace@ENRON 10/03/2000 01:22 AM 
Mark: I am reviewing a CA that has an Ohio choice of law provision and an Ohio exclusive jurisdiction provision, although this latter provision would only apply to any injunction actions since the CA has our standard arbitration provision.  The opposing side has already rejected New York as the governing law.  Can we live with Ohio? Jim

(PG&E), in filings with the California Public=20 Utilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator=20 (Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases= =20 in the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate=20 cap from $250 per megawatt hour to $100, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour.=20 In seeking the rate cap, PG&E is joined by Edison International, the parent= =20 company of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN= ),=20 a ratepayer advocacy group. ANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale= =20 market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San=20 Diego this summer. As San Diego Gas & Electric had paid off its stranded=20 costs, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&E customers=20 were exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled=20 due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&E=20 customers=20 were not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&E had not=20 paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze. Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same.=20 PG&E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a resul= t=20 is about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7= =20 billion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&E has been=20 unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real=20 terms, PG&E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale=20 market this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers= =20 on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&E has paid about $2.7=20 billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount= =20 is growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's= =20 motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale=20 rates in California. However, even though PG&E as a whole is in debt, the utility=01*as well as= =20 other divisions under parent company PG&E Corp.=01*is still making money of= f=20 deregulation in California. For instance, PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear=20 plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa= le=20 market. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities= =01* the=20 ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power=20 assets=01*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addit= ion,=20 PG&E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing= =20 very well. And the unregulated National Energy Group=01*which operates in= =20 markets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and=20 New Hampshire=01*posted a 233-percent profit increase for the second quarte= r.=20 Thus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&E and its parent,= =20 PG&E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&E Corp. has stated that it does not= =20 support rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other= =20 states. PG&E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in=20 revenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last=20 year. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts=20 PG&E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&E wants to convince=20 shareholders=20 that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that= =20 it sells. On the other hand, PG&E is attempting to convince regulators=20 that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay= =20 for power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&E has earned cannot come=20 anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due=20 to its obligation of serving customers. PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest,= =20 or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid,= =20 something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due=20 to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the= =20 utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs= =20 are already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&E= =20 will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt=20 it has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled=20 a hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these=20 proceedings will be whether or not PG&E should be allowed to turn over=20 its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted= .=20 PG&E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based= =20 on the date which the CPUC determines that PG&E had in fact paid off its=20 stranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest. It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&E that filed= =20 the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN=20 and PG&E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most= =20 issues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want=20 to see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons.=20 TURN says that PG&E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the=20 rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted=20 from that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the=20 proceedings related to PG&E's proposal, specifically with regard to the=20 possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer= s. Within the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear=20 on PG&E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates=20 have called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation= =20 in California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&E'= s=20 proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California=20 to a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&E has=20 very clearly stated that its proposal is a ""necessary short-term step to=20 try to bring prices back in line."" PG&E's efforts really shouldn't be viewe= d=20 as a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&E is merel= y=20 attempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure=20 temporary=20 lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and=20 transfer=20 its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulati= on=20 via a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&E's best interests as it=20 continues=20 to sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&E probably recognizes= =20 that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new=20 power plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term econo= my=20 of the state.

Dave: This is for routine and ""small"" matters only.  The resolutions are drafted so that the signature authority is narrow and specific.   Frequency is only one factor.   An example would be certain defined right-of-way agreements and certain defined confirms.  I will review the authority that has been delegated currently.  [Julia and Deb, please pull the existing resolutions with delegation of authority and let's review.] David W Delainey 10/09/2000 01:37 PM 
Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.  I have difficulty with some of our VP's having signing authority.  I believe this is a significant control issue. Mark, is this widespread in ENA? Regards Delainey 
Well, I talked with legal about this and I understand that they can and do give signature authority to directors on a relatively frequent basis. I gave them the parameters for Ben to make it even easier. If they end up saying it's a bigger issue than originally articulated, I'll continue with Ben as we currently have it.  Thanks.

Although I know there are specific circumstances for Entergy and Southern's case (inadequate corp. guarantee language in the master agreements), I echo Rogers comments.  We must resolve these issues quickly. In order to make the P&L and EOL targets that Lavo and Delainey have imposed on East Power for 4th qtr 2000 and calender year 2001, we must be able to transact with all load serving utilities and all merchant marketing shops. We are agressively making markets in all regions in an effort to build liquidity, and it is imperative to remove encumberances.

Bryan - I have a meeting scheduled with Mark on Monday at 4:00 to update him on the status of a number of item associated with our Department's technology plans.  I had hoped to update him on the status of the intraweb site; however, since no one from your group has contacted me to follow-up on our Sept. 29 meeting, I was wondering if you would be available to attend the meeting I have with Mark.  If so, I would hope that we could discuss issues pertinent to moving the process along as our goal is to have a functioning web site as soon as possible.

Robert - is this legit? George - the beat goes on 
Mary: This is complicated for oil companies.  Mobil Exxon only does hedging.  Shell has at least two groups, with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly trading for profit.  BP Amoco is sort of in between.  It is very clear with respect to Cargill and El Paso and Shell -- each should be primary.  The companies may be trying to manipulate the rules by having the hedging organization send in the application. Let me know if you need other info.

It's ok to use Blakes given the conflicts.  On the structure, I will forward this message to Steven Douglas and ask for his advice. Mark Peter Keohane 10/16/2000 01:01 PM 
Mark I am following up with you regarding legal support for this matter. Mark P. is dedicated to this project and getting up the learning curve by focusing his time on understanding the regulatory/statutory/licensing requirements for a retail affiliate for Alberta electricity.  We hope to have a recommendation shortly on an action plan for the regulatory compliance requirements, a recommendation on contracting forms (separate commercial and residential consumer forms) and to begin drafting forms. However, as discussed, outside counsel legal support will be required (i) to set up/register the retail entity to do business (subject to confirmation of the outstanding structuring issue, on which I await an answer); (ii) confirm all regulatory/statutory/licensing requirements for a retail affiliate; (iii) review and advise on contracting forms; and (iv) take an advocacy position for us at upcoming regulatory hearings.  In this regard we had agreed to talk to Stikeman Elliott about representation.  It turns out the Stikemans has an unresolveable conflict, as it acts for Enmax, the City of Calgary's retail affiliate and a direct competitor.  From asking around, it also seems that any of the firms which have/may have experience in the developing retail market, have acquired that experience for a client that would put them in direct conflict as well (ex. Bennet Jones - Atco/Canadian Utilities;  Macleod Dixon and McCarthy Tetrault - TransAlta;  Burnet Duckworth - City of Calgary/Enmax/City of Medicine Hat;  Borden Ladner Gervais - EPCOR), many of whom we have no experience in dealing with in any event.  It seems to me that the available alternatives are Blake Cassels & Graydon and Osler Hoskin & Harcourt, neither of whom to my specific knowledge have specific expertise in this area.  However, as noted, those with any actual (or purported) expertise tend for that reason to be conflicted.  Accordingly, my suggestion is that I speak to Blakes to see what expertise they have, but likely nonetheless retain them (assuming there is no conflict) on the basis of their general capabilities and their understanding and commitment to Enron.  At the end of the day, even if there is a learning curve, it is seemingly learnable and inevitable.  Please let me know if you have a problem, as we need to move quickly to get on with the project. To confirm, you were going to let me know how we should proceed with structuring the affiliate (liability vs. tax efficiency), which may be affected by how and if EES participates. Once the ball is rolling on the Alberta electricity front, we will re-focus on gas and other jurisdictions, such as Ontario. Regards, Peter.

The associate here who has been asked to work on it said Mary Cook is the ENA in house lawyer working on the deal.  Before he left us a few months ago, Kevin Leitao had from time to time worked on behalf of some of our utility clients in transactions with ENA where, for example, Sara Schackleton or Shari Stack handled the transaction for ENA.  Before we go forward on this for Hydro-Quebec, however, I wanted to double check with you to make sure thare was not any problem from ENA's standpoint.  Could you reply to this and just let me know.

Dave: Based on our discussions this morning: 1.  Internal Costs -- a capacity charge will be determined for each wholesale business unit based on a time allocation matrix that each lawyer and paralegal prepares.  The time allocation matrix will be revised  during the year if material changes in the work occur. 2.  Outside Costs -- require internal sign-off by GC and COO to spend more than $10,000 on a potential transaction AND a written transaction budget for proposed outside legal expenses more than $10,000.  Wherever possible, a firm cap on legal fees should be negotiated.  A memorandum will be sent from the GC and [Chairman of the Wholesale Group?] laying out the procedure to all employees. 3.  Selection of Outside Lawyers -- expressly add billing rates and efficiency as key considerations, in addition to quality, in the selection of outside counsel.  [Dave, we need to complete our discussion on this point.] Our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel. 4.  Reopener!  -- need to review where business changes significantly. David W Delainey 10/19/2000 12:33 PM 
Guys, notes from the morning meeting.  Please review and comment. Specific action items: a) i)further calculation of ENA/Non- ENA capacity charges, ii) estimation of outside legal and iii) formulation of charge out/feedback process to the business units; b) need budget/review for competitive analysis, technical and restructuring. Regards Delainey 
Dave: I have attached the ""time allocations"" (which are used for inside costs only) by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement? Mark

I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows: 1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts. 2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed. 3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign. 4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp. 5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations. Please give me your comments.

With David Haug's help  we were able to get a significant portion of undisputed payments that had been delinquent for some time (in some cases since before the first of the year) paid. including a recent payment of $6 million. Even so, approximately $18 million still remains unpaid to EECC and seriously delinquent.  EcoElectrica has identified $8.4 million as being withheld in connection with disputed liquidated damage payments, but there remains an undisputed, unpaid balance of approximately $9.6 million that EcoElectrica has not offered any contractual or other explanation for withholding other than that  they are working on other matters. Larry Izzo needs to get these claims resolved, and at least needs a commitment from EcoElectrica to a date for formal senior management discussions under the contract from the project. Failing that, he will be directing EECC to seek clearance to institute arbitration proceedings. 
Bruce:  I am tied up for lunch, but let's get together during the day on Monday or Tuesday.   Mark Bruce Lundstrom@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/20/2000 09:25 AM 
Mark - Are you free for lunch next week?  Breakfast or a beer after work would work as well. In my view, APACHI has a limited life span and I'd like to see what opportunities there still might be for the remaining lawyers/legal specialists in my group. Thanks, Bruce 
I know this is a bit longer than you usually get from your reports, but I thought I would give you a more detailed report to begin the transition. Hope this is ok. 
Dave: I have attached the ""time allocations"" (which are used for inside costs only) by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement? Mark

Mark:  just a ""heads up"" that we may be called to react to this attached NYMERX press release since Enron added the provisions they oppose in the release.  H.R. 4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.) There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress.  The last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only obstacle to enactment in the Senate.)  The ""Energy Provisions"" discussed in this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate.  It is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being negotiated. Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in the Senate.  The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves.  All and all, this press release is outlandish. This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour. Please call if you do indeed get press calls and need our assistance.  Many thanks. EXCHANGE EXPRESSES OUTRAGE AT HOUSE PASSAGE OF H.R. 4541 NEW YORK, NY, October 20, 2000 -- In response to passage by the House of Representatives last night of H.R. 4541, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport issued the following statement: The New York Mercantile Exchange finds it particularly egregious that, by approving subsection (g) (3) of Section 106, the House would not only remove the energy and metals marketplaces from public scrutiny and regulatory oversight, but also do this in a fashion that discriminates between established markets versus start-up electronic forums. It is particularly outrageous, at a time when every U.S. consumer is feeling the impact of high energy prices, to allow lobbying by a small group of vested interests to influence Congress to take these markets out of the public eye and create an advantage for people to trade on private, proprietary systems lacking the protections of a neutral self-regulatory organization. Policy makers, regulators, and the American public will be deprived of currently available information on market participation, concentration, and financial performance. This is not only a matter of ill-conceived public policy but is also anti-competitive and directly contrary to the recommendations made by the President'sWorking Group on financial markets. Even House members who voted in favor of the bill have been publicly quoted as saying that it must be changed in the Senate. The New York Mercantile Exchange plans to fight adamantly at the Senate level to demand that this subsection either be eliminated or be amended to create a consistent regulatory policy for electronic and open outcry markets. # # # ---------------------------------- This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be privileged and confidential.

Dear Mark, I hope you are doing well.  You may be getting a call from JoAnne Pinkett regarding a proposal for future funding of the BEAR program.  There has apparently been some difficulty in communication between the BEAR board and our board. Any proposal has to make its way through the Children's Services Committee then the Executive Committee.  It is then put before the whole board for a vote.  I thought that you would be an idea person to advise the BEAR representatives as to how to structure the proposal to the Children's Committee to ensure that it is given a fair and expeditious review and decision - a proposal that would be comprehensible to board members who are not directly involved with the BEAR program.  I also thought you could give this advice without having to commit a great deal of time (including travel time for meetings). I think everyone agrees that it is a great program and that we should be supportive of such public-private partnerships.  There is probably some difference of opinion amongst the board as to how much support (and at what pace) we should give the program.  I would deeply appreciate your helping the BEAR folks make the clearest proposal possible.  I, for one, want this program to succeed.  As good as its current work is - I think it holds even greater potential for benefiting the children we serve.

I spoke to Dr. Emilio Pinto, at the Sao Paulo lawfirm of Tozzini Freire about joining ISDA.  He and his firm are doing a lot of work for Enron.  He is familiar with ISDA and said he was interested in joining.  I told him he would get a call and some materials that he could present to his Executive Committee.  I reviewed with him the cost of $10,000.  Please give him a call at 011-551-1-2322100.  I think he could help build membership in ISDA in Brazil and eventually become a rep office for ISDA in South America.  He goes by Emilio.  I am working on a lawfirm in Argentina.  Let  me know if you have any questions. Regards,

I had a brief conversation with Vicki about splitting the costs 50/50 on the legal side to be consistent with the business arrangement.  She asked to use the European operation as  a model.

To be brief, this project is percolating but being held up on the following fronts: 1.  ENA/EES issues.  I have not been involved so I don't know where it is at.  As request by Dave P., Mark P. has sent a copy of his preliminary issues memo to Vicki S. 2.  Market Achievement Plan for unsold PPAs.  The Government is expected to announce October 31st.  This will impact the market in many aspects, including the viability of competitive retail market options v. regulated rate options. 3.  We have proposals from two law firms.  Donahue Ernst & Young and Blakes. My preference would be DEY for diversification reasons, but DEY may have unresolvable conflicts which I would have to discuss with you if we are to proceed.  Blakes proposal may also have significant conflicts, which may be resolvable but which may limit the effectiveness of their representation. Nonetheless, it seems a decision will not need to be made until the end of October.  In the meantime, Mark P. is working on scoping out legal and compliance issues, as well as forms. Peter.

activities of Enron? Dear all, As we know, some of the persons on the distribution list of Polish weekly updates still receive the updates, although they have changed their positions and/or responsibilties. As we would not like to bother you with our e-mails with the reports that you do not need, please confirm that you wish to continue receiving the reports on Enron's activities in Poland. The common address ECT London European Trading will be deleted from the list as a whole. Only the persons who send the confirmation will be added to the list. Thank you. With best regards, Jarek Ferenc 
Could you please respond for me.   Mark 
According to our records all of you have some sort of high speed internet access to your home.  Either Cable Modem or DSL service.  When most of these lines where installed, we did not have a standard on how to connect back to the Enron network.  Most if not all of you are using the Client software on your PC's.  In order to provide more security to both Enron and Your PC.  We need to configure and deploy a Nortel Instant Internet Box.   the way the Nortel box works is what they call splitt tunnelling.  If it sees traffic that needs to go to enron it will go through the tunnel, other wise it goes directly to the internet. We will need to know the following information to configure and deploy the Router 1. UserName and Login if required by the ISP. 2. If you have static IP addresses, We need to know that as well. 3. Co/RC to charge for the Nortel Box (Approx $500.00) If you no longer have DSL or Cable service or You do not have either please let us know.  Other wise Please return the above information back to Enron network security. Thanks Mark Scott 
I am ok with it so long as you don't spend much time at it.  If there is a material time commitment or the company is competing head to head with Enron, then it would be a problem.  Mark Randal Maffett 10/16/2000 02:10 PM 
Mark - back in June you and I had a brief discussion re: the topic below. Nexus has now extended a formal invitation for me to join their board so complying with the Code of Ethics I sent the e-mail below to Sharon Butcher this morning.  She responded by asking if I'd discussed this with you and I relayed the essence of our brief conversation and forwarded to her the first e-mail I'd sent to you.  Call if you have any questions.  x33212. RANDY 
Sharon - eight years ago before coming to work for Enron, I was a partner in a cogen development company which we sold in 1993.  It was through that company that I developed a relationship with Enron and subsequently came to work here in 1993. Since coming to Enron, I have maintained regular contact and networks with several of my former partners.  One of them, Barry Curtiss-Lusher, started up his own oil and gas exploration and production company, Nexus Resources, in Denver.  Barry has recently asked me to join his Board of Directors. Reviewing the Enron Code of Ethics (specifically, page 57, July 2000 edition) I wanted to provide the following information: Nexus Resources, 650 S. Cherry St., Suite 420, Denver, CO  80246 Barry Curtiss-Lusher, President/CEO privately owned principle business is oil and gas exploration and production in various basins throughout the U.S., primarily in Louisiana, Kansas and the Rocky Mountain states My role as a Board member would be similar to any other Board role with regular meetings on a quarterly basis (teleconferencing is permitted under Nexus' bylaws) with all expenses, if any, paid by Nexus.  Currently, Nexus does not pay any cash stipend to its Directors.  It does, however, compensate Board members with Nexus stock.  Additionally, I would be making a minor personal investment in Nexus stock. Pursuant to the Enron Code of Ethics, I would/will NOT be performing any managerial, professional or other duties which would interfere with my own specific job performance at Enron.  Nor is Nexus currently involved in any business which competes, directly or indirectly, with that of Enron Corp. or any of its subsidiaries. Although I have been nominated and approved by the current Board of Directors of Nexus Resources, I have NOT yet accepted the position pending resolution and approval by Enron Management pursuant to the Code of Ethics.  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the information above and/or what other steps need to be taken. RANDY MAFFETT V.P. - Enron North America ext. 33212

The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over the past few years.  I think this environment requires additional time to be devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible service to our clients.  Within the next month, I have asked Janette to schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new organizational chart .  I  would envision that we would focus on the following: review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues review of the top ten legal risks form contracts and other documentation projects legal budget legal resources, inside and outside performance metrics In addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC.  Let me know what you think about that. Mark Haedicke 
Why wouldn't we use the EEI form in Ontario?  The markets will be integrated, at least in part, into the US.  We could have an annex for Ontario.  We will be using the EEI form right across the border in the US.  Let 's chat about this. Regards, Mark Peter Keohane 10/25/2000 08:58 AM 
Chris, Greg is putting the finishing touches on the Power Master as well as a GTC. Greg, Chris needs the Master form ASAP so we can take the lead on this Ontario industry form development iniative.  Can you finalize the form and prepare a bullet point memo as requested by Chris comparing the differences between our form and EEI. Greg, also you should coordinate a Calgary office meeting with traders and originators (not more than 1 hour) to unveil and explain the form ASAP. Alberta Market Opening and PPA trading commences Jan 1/01 and we may need push to get Masters signed or rely on GTC in the short term. Chris, you should do likewise in Toronto when appropriate. Milly, would it be a worthwhile expense for Greg to attend the firstOntario industry meeting in Toronto with Chris, as Greg has the background on developing the form? Mark and Elizabeth, FYI. Peter. 
Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one year.  Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to closing.  My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power contracts.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Please forward this memo on to the lawyers on your team.

Alan, I like your suggestions.  Please forward your e-mail to the rest of the ogc to facilitate discussion.  I would like to finalize this policy next week.  Mark Alan Aronowitz 10/26/2000 01:42 PM 
Mark: Got your voice mail on this. I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year. My thoughts are as follows: 1) Policy Scope: I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to trading as well as origination transactions. As you know, often there is a very blurry line. 2) Existing Masters: If a master is in place, confirmations will be used for terms of one month to greater than one year. I don't think it will be practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there are material modifications done to the pre-approved confirmation template in the master, which would require Legal approval in the present state of affairs.  I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated contracts outside a Master Agreement. 3) Order of Magnitude: We should consider having a dollar figure (determined simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or the Enron financial commitment amount), coupled with the one year or greater term, that would require the additional OGC/AGC approval in order to make sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts. I would be happy to discuss this with you further. Alan

To All - Thanks again for the participation in this project.  I believe we made some progress yesterday on the overall look and feel of the site. Meeting Notes: Mark - Presented ideas for the look and feel of the web site based on law firm web sites and intra-Enron sites.  I will continue to pursue work with the IT group on the design and implementation of the site. Michelle - Reported on her progress with the ENA PR group on a name. click.legal or click.law seem to be the favorite addresses; however, ""legalmatters.enron"" was also suggested.  Michelle will continue to work with the ENA PR group to develop a name, possible logo and slogan/tag-line consistent with the Enron vision statement. Janette - Reported on the status of the organization chart information to be used on the site.  Indicated she is still waiting for responses from several of the groups for the ""who are we"" paragraph.  She is also making progress on matching the org. chart to the individual legal team members.  Work on this project will continue. Ed/James - Both reported on the status of link identification.  Discussion took place regarding the further identification of categories associated with the links and those links that will be useful to the Department, realizing that few clients will actual access our site for links.  Work on a listing of categories and sites for these categories will continue. General Information: Subsequent to our meeting, I met with our designated IT project coordinator - Tamika Hebert.  We spent almost two hours discussing the functionality we want in the site.  Unfortunately, John Reese, our IT designer, was out of the office and unable to provide me with the design ideas he has to date.  I hope to receive these designs later today or tomorrow and will make them available to everyone for comment.  I also provided Tamika with references to some of the sites we reviewed during our meeting so that she could understand some of the look, feel and functionality we want. 
Stacy, please look into this ASAP and report back to me.   Mark

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite. As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas. This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning. ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare. Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly. Regards
