Please find attached a revised version of the market opening condition precedent language that will need to be included, for the time being, in all Canadian power transactions, whether physical or financial.  I believe this language is now in final form. Greg 
Attached is a clean version of the current draft of master netting agreement.  If interested, also attached is a redline from the last draft of the form.  One item to consider is whether we desire a confidentiality provision in this form which has not yet been included.

Due to the extent of work required to modify our annexes, GTCs etc. on EOL (IT coordination, counterparty notification and the like) and the traders' strong preference to not often make changes on EOL product documentation, we propose to implement the EOL form change in one aggregate revision as and when the trading forms committee concludes its work on events of default and termination valuation/remedies.  Should you think this should be handled differently, please advise.

We are nearing the ""final"" form of the document for further use.  I have asked Bradford to speak with you regarding use of it for major trading counterparties that may not be investment grade, but with whom Credit sees the ability to greatly enhance our liquidity via netting of margin requirements (not the small accounts). Two issues. 1.  Do you think we should write a risk memo concerning the issues surrounding the ultimate effectiveness under the Code and ""square setoff"" rights?  Basically, the intent would be to clarify that if a court did not enforce the close-out netting, and then did not enforce the square setoff, our collateral position on a trading master by trading master basis could be underwater because we would have netted the positions under the master netting agreement for margining purposes.  Further to this, the bankruptcy reform aspects of this issue are not moving as previously hoped due to consumer issues and current events. 2.  FYI:  It has come to my attention this week that Global Finance has consummated a receivable financing, and desires to consummate additional such financings which conflict with master netting agreements in place (as well as setoff language in trading contracts) and with the general concept of master netting for the future.  We are meeting tomorrow with Bradford and Global Finance representatives to gather facts, sort through the issues, and try to resolve what appear to be different objectives concerning trading receivables.  From a cash perspective, I would think Enron as whole would get more benefit from master netting (dollar for dollar benefit) than loan security (which would never be a dollar for dollar benefit)--do you think this is a correct analysis?

To my knowledge there are a variety of prepay forms of transactions. 1.  Some older forms were physically based (I think primarily with respect to gas and with Chase).  Teresa Bushman and/or Dan Lyons worked on these transactions). 2.  Newer forms are triangulated swaps.  There are a series with Citibank, related to credit link notes (see Gareth Bahlmann re link notes), known as Yosemite/Delta Transactions.  There are 4 in the series (4th series had three prepays, US, Sterling and Euro).  The 5th did not close. 3.  There is at least one other with Citibank, dated June 2001 and it is being wrapped into the pipeline credit facility and will be extinguished via the placement of the pipeline facility. 4.  I am aware of one other (via the London office) which was extended September 2001, among Credit Suisse First Boston and ENA and Barclays. I suggest you contact Lisa Bills, Joe Deffner and Dan Boyle to determine a complete list.  I believe that this detail may have been determined by one of the teams formed last week.  You may wish to check with Haedicke. In respect of accounting treatment, and book treatment, I suggest the following names:  Alan Quaintance, Clint Walden re accounting.  Dan Boyle has a name of someone who worked on placing the Delta transactions in the risk books, but I cannot remember the name.

Attached are clean and redline versions of the ""without margining"" master netting agreement.  The redline is just for your review to discern the changes. I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow. Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.  As previously noted today, the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical ""(including automatic termination, if applicable)"" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included. Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

1.  Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.  If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.  Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well. 2.  At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.  Carol and I will summarize for Louise, Bill and Tanya, but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis.

As you are aware a ""safety net"" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement. Any questions, call me. Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (713) 646-3393 (fax) 
1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language. 2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns. See attached reline version to read the changes. 3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex. 4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler. The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to ""kill"" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1). Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (713) 646-3393 (fax)

Accounting:  Information purposes. Joel:  Financing issues. Others:  Please review and comment on what is hopefully close to a final draft. Thank you everyone.

Do you have copies of the Alberta and British Columbia Acts?  I know they are less stringent than the US rules, but I don't know the exact levels. 
Speaking of Canadian eligible contract participants...I was told from an originator in Canada that per someone in Enron Canada's legal department, Canadian contract participants are not held to the same standards as US (i.e. they are not required to have minimum assets &/or equity etc.).  Is this true???  Please advise and forward to me the eligible contract participant information we discussed at the happy-hour last wednesday. Thanks WEndy

Mary, I have spoken to Taffy regarding this matter.  She said that even if we move the forms within atty.fms, that the satillite office will still not be able to access them.

Attached below for your review is a proposed short form master agreement for Canadian use on the basis of our prior conversations.  The form is now available for your use under appropriate circumstances.

Mary, All those traps with security were worked out 4 years ago.  London can get into the o: drive from there, the only directory they have access to in the o: drive is the atty.fms bank.  If we put the swap forms back there, they can get at them.  I know, because I've pulled them up myself from London. Mary Cook 03/13/01 09:39 AM

I anticipate that Samantha will be out of the office for a time.  In order that Samantha's work in progress be covered in her absence, please take the following steps.

I can't tell by Lotus Notes, is anyone aware of a ""credit sleeve"" with TMG? 
Tana, I have a favour - Jon McKay of our office is wondering if you have any record of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction dealing with ""credit sleeving""? All we have here is a copy of an ISDA with them - not what he's looking for. Thanks Linda 403-974-6908

It has come to my attention that a copy of each ECC Isda we finalize should be forwarded to you for your records.  I am not sure that this has been consistently accomplished since I was unaware.  In order to verify that you have all copies, could you send me a listing of all of your Isda ECC files on hand.  I will have it compared to our database and we will copy for you those that you may not have.  Proceeding forward, we will copy you as and when completed.  Thank you. Paralegals:  This memo should serve as notice to all paralegals that upon finalizing any ECC Isda file a copy of the blue file should be forwarded to Greg in Calgary.

Thank you! Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) mary.cook@enron.com 
Bill - If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty. Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system. My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed. In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know. Mark 
CP/ID 94330, Cargill Ferrous International 
CP/ID 94330, Cargill Ferrous International FYI... Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill, Inc. Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure. Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name. Best Rgds.

I have discussed the timing for correction publication issue with our trading desk.  Most price source publications for paper and pulp products are published only on a monthly basis and therefore the 40 days is needed in order to utilize the correction concept, which we do want to be able to utilize.

Mary, we have received an executed copy of the Lakeside financial confirm, which has been confirmed pursuant to the standard 1992 form of ISDA. However, they also executed and returned the execution page of an ISDA base contract.  Since I didn't send them any documents, I assume it came from the documents you provided to them.  Could you do me a favour and forward to me the package of ISDA documents (ie. base contract, schedule, credit support annex, etc.).  Please do not contact the counterparty. Thanks Greg 
We will have our lunch meeting tomorrow.

Dear Mrs.Cook, My partner Claude Girard and myself will call you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, your time, concerning the draft ISDA Master Agreement. If this is not convenient to you, please let me know. Serge Gloutnay 
I am working on creating a Master ISDA Agreement with HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc., to be guaranteed by Hydro Quebec.  In my work on this file, Hydro provided us with a form previously executed on the physical side and they also propose to reissue a guaranty to cover both physical and financial matters in an aggregate amount.  Question, our Quebec counsel advised that the guaranty, if executed in Quebec, would have to also be in French pursuant to the statutue regarding government papers etc.  I noticed that the prior guaranty seems only to be in English with no French, and also note that it states that it is governed by NY law.  Do you think if it is governed by NY law that the actual papering in French requirement does not then apply ot Hydro Quebec as a government entity?  Interesting.  Please let me hear from both of you.  Thanks.  Mary Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
I am currently working on a new ISDA wherein the counterparty is a US sub of a foreign Guarantor.  Upon consulting with Rhett Jackson in Tax, he thought we needed to work a form of the tax reps into the guaranty since the Guarantor was foreign.

Please forward to Louise as I did not have her email address.  Thank you. Further to documents previously submitted, please note: TAX:  Regarding tax provision with HQUS set forth in the ISDA, our tax department does require the representation in our US to US masters.  Please have your tax attorney discuss this with our tax attorney, Morris Clark at 713 853-5846.  Further, upon review of our tax comments as to the guaranty, I have been advised by our tax department that the FORM W 8BEN will not be necessary, therefore, the one sentence paragraph in my comments immediately following Specified Jurisdiction should be deleted. OPINIONS:  As I referenced in our conversation today, in respect of the HQ opinion, the definitional structure is intended to cover the Guaranty and the ISDA to the extent ISDA representations concern HQ as Guarantor and joining the ISDA for effecting such specific representations.  In connection with the Guaranty, it is intended that the opinion cover the Guaranty as it relates to supporting the particular types of underlying obligations to be entered into by HQUS and ENA, which we understand to be both hedge derivatives and speculative derivatives for up to multiple years. BOARD MINUTES:  My reading of the resolutions submitted suggests that HQ guaranties for financial derivative transactions are not affirmatively authorized thereby.  Are there other resolutions? We are all available for call at 10 your time on Monday. Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax)

Please see the attached revised form of opinion for HQ.  Since we will not require HQ joinder of Master, I revised the opinion to reflect its primary coverage of the Guaranty.

Per research at HQUS, and further research here, it is noted that there are several outstanding financial trades.  The earliest trade date is 9/11/2000.

Will you be coordinating with Enron Corp. Clement Abrams regarding Guaranties relating to the Canada confirms as well? Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
I am confused.  Perhaps we can all get on a call and talk to determine how we can best coordinate the various matters.  My experience is that often the confirm and annex issues relate and need to be coordinated together if the counterparty has comments.  Per your note I will continue to do the Powerex deal for now. By copy to Taffy I request that you set up a conference call with Greg, Tana, Mark and myself as soon as our schedules all permit.  Thanks. Mary Enron North America Corp.

No, I do not think so.  I think we might have a misunderstanding on the separation of roles between ECC and ENA.  ECC legal will do the legal work in assisting the Calgary confirm desk in preparing the actual confirms, amendments, terminations, etc.  However, ENA legal will continue to handle all legal matters or inquiries with respect to the negotiation and interpretation of the contracts surrounding the confirms which, I assume, would include the negotiation and interpretation of matters such as the financial GTC forms.  Therefore, I would suspect that the negotiation of the terms of the GTC between ECC and PowerEX, for example, would still be handled by ENA.  Also, as a result, I would suspect that the guarantees would also be coordinated with Clement through ENA.  Perhaps Mark Taylor can clarify on these points. Cheers Greg MARY COOK 11/10/2000 10:40 AM

At the direction of Mark Taylor in order to meet the EOL business demands the following files are being reassigned from Tana as set forth below.  On each file you are assigned please change the paralegal assignment in the trading database and review the comment sections to provide yourself with an update on the file and then check with the current attorney and ask if there is anything currently required of you with respect to the file.  If you have questions on the files, you should feel free to visit with Tana too.  In the future Tana will handle only limited ISDA files, but of course she is always available to answer questions adn problem solve. Panus:  Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited/ Apache Lakeside Feeders Ltd.

Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank into their own subdirectory called ""Swap Forms"" (look it up just like a person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't know if you can access other subdirectories. We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms directory. Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up. 
Please put your initial on the bottom left of each credit worksheet for easy reference by the attorneys as to which paralegal is handling each workfile. Thank you.

Jeff, thanks for your work on Bob's draft, however, for form management purposes we are going to continue with our previous style which is to include the crossborder annexes. 1.  Attached below is the ENA/US Annex A, which is the base GTC type of document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ENA contracts with a Canadian party we use the Canadian Annex attachment (also attached below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ENA contracts with a foreign counterparty other than Canada, the Canadian Annex may be utilized with additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US. 2.  Attached below is the ECC/Canadian Annex A, which is the base GTC type of document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ECC contracts with a US party we use the United States Annex attachment (also attached below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ECC contracts with a foreign counterparty other than US, the United States Annex may be utilized with additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US. At your convenience, please review the Canadian and United States annexes and advise of any comments.  Thanks again. Note to Paralegals:  Please note that the annexes are now under current forms.  If you have any questions about how they are to be utilized, please stop by to discuss.

I am currently working on a form for the master netting without the CSA.  It is somewhat complicated--so if you have such a request, please await the new form.  Do not try to do it yourself.

Attached are clean and redline versions of the ""without margining"" master netting agreement.  The redline is just for your review to discern the changes. I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow. Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

There exists another receivable financing covering power receivables structured at the corporate level.  I am working with Trey Cash and Melinda Winn to extract the receivables to enable the master netting agreements to be executed.  For now, please touch base with me prior to initialing any master netting that includes power.  Please note we are still working on the extraction from the gas receivables as well.

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.  As previously noted today, the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical ""(including automatic termination, if applicable)"" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included. Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

1.  Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.  If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.  Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well. 2.  At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.  Carol and I will summarize for Louise, Bill and Tanya, but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis.  Management has asked that we contact the counterparties at least each day and keep this moving to closure of each agreement as quickly as possible.

First, thank you all for your hard work this last week, and in advance for the next weeks to come. Second, suspend your preparation of Canada work reports for the time being.  I will let you know when to resume.  I simply do not have time to collate the report the next few weeks. Third, be sure to let me know if you are having difficulties meeting deadlines, getting enough help, or the like. Fourth, we will keep our lunch meetings as scheduled and will use the time to strategize on our current projects rather than reviewing the form etc.  We will get back to that after the workload settles down.

As you are aware a ""safety net"" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement. Any questions, call me.

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language. 2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns. See attached reline version to read the changes. 3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex. 4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler. The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to ""kill"" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1). Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (713) 646-3393 (fax)

I suggest the attached language be substituted for the current language in the schedules in respect of Engineering Report where  a PV/PDP mac is utilized.  Tana, maybe this could go as an optional insert under Docs to be Delivered, rather than back in the collateral schedule with the pv/pdp language, so people won't forget to put it in under required deliveries.

Dear Mrs.Cook, My partner Claude Girard and myself will call you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, your time, concerning the draft ISDA Master Agreement. If this is not convenient to you, please let me know. Serge Gloutnay 
I am working on creating a Master ISDA Agreement with HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc., to be guaranteed by Hydro Quebec.  In my work on this file, Hydro provided us with a form previously executed on the physical side and they also propose to reissue a guaranty to cover both physical and financial matters in an aggregate amount.  Question, our Quebec counsel advised that the guaranty, if executed in Quebec, would have to also be in French pursuant to the statutue regarding government papers etc.  I noticed that the prior guaranty seems only to be in English with no French, and also note that it states that it is governed by NY law.  Do you think if it is governed by NY law that the actual papering in French requirement does not then apply ot Hydro Quebec as a government entity?  Interesting.  Please let me hear from both of you.  Thanks.  Mary Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
I am currently working on a new ISDA wherein the counterparty is a US sub of a foreign Guarantor.  Upon consulting with Rhett Jackson in Tax, he thought we needed to work a form of the tax reps into the guaranty since the Guarantor was foreign.  I see the same issue arising in respect of certain other amendments on which I am working.  Rhett is looking over this matter now and I will advise.    Any thoughts? Enron North America Corp.

Please forward to Louise as I did not have her email address.  Thank you. Further to documents previously submitted, please note: TAX:  Regarding tax provision with HQUS set forth in the ISDA, our tax department does require the representation in our US to US masters.  Please have your tax attorney discuss this with our tax attorney, Morris Clark at 713 853-5846.  Further, upon review of our tax comments as to the guaranty, I have been advised by our tax department that the FORM W 8BEN will not be necessary, therefore, the one sentence paragraph in my comments immediately following Specified Jurisdiction should be deleted. OPINIONS:  As I referenced in our conversation today, in respect of the HQ opinion, the definitional structure is intended to cover the Guaranty and the ISDA to the extent ISDA representations concern HQ as Guarantor and joining the ISDA for effecting such specific representations.  In connection with the Guaranty, it is intended that the opinion cover the Guaranty as it relates to supporting the particular types of underlying obligations to be entered into by HQUS and ENA, which we understand to be both hedge derivatives and speculative derivatives for up to multiple years. BOARD MINUTES:  My reading of the resolutions submitted suggests that HQ guaranties for financial derivative transactions are not affirmatively authorized thereby.  Are there other resolutions? We are all available for call at 10 your time on Monday. Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax)

Please see the attached revised form of opinion for HQ.  Since we will not require HQ joinder of Master, I revised the opinion to reflect its primary coverage of the Guaranty.

Per research at HQUS, and further research here, it is noted that there are several outstanding financial trades.  The earliest trade date is 9/11/2000.

I am confused.  Perhaps we can all get on a call and talk to determine how we can best coordinate the various matters.  My experience is that often the confirm and annex issues relate and need to be coordinated together if the counterparty has comments.  Per your note I will continue to do the Powerex deal for now.

No, I do not think so.  I think we might have a misunderstanding on the separation of roles between ECC and ENA.  ECC legal will do the legal work in assisting the Calgary confirm desk in preparing the actual confirms, amendments, terminations, etc.  However, ENA legal will continue to handle all legal matters or inquiries with respect to the negotiation and interpretation of the contracts surrounding the confirms which, I assume, would include the negotiation and interpretation of matters such as the financial GTC forms.  Therefore, I would suspect that the negotiation of the terms of the GTC between ECC and PowerEX, for example, would still be handled by ENA.  Also, as a result, I would suspect that the guarantees would also be coordinated with Clement through ENA.  Perhaps Mark Taylor can clarify on these points. Cheers Greg MARY COOK 11/10/2000 10:40 AM

At the direction of Mark Taylor in order to meet the EOL business demands the following files are being reassigned from Tana as set forth below.  On each file you are assigned please change the paralegal assignment in the trading database and review the comment sections to provide yourself with an update on the file and then check with the current attorney and ask if there is anything currently required of you with respect to the file.  If you have questions on the files, you should feel free to visit with Tana too.  In the future Tana will handle only limited ISDA files, but of course she is always available to answer questions adn problem solve. Panus:  Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited/ Apache Lakeside Feeders Ltd. Ontario Power BNP Paribas (Guaranty only) Powerex Corporation Bailey:  Engage Canada Enmax Energy Dynegy US PUD #1 Clark County Orlando Utilities Commission Samantha is not now being assigned additional files because many more of her files are now high or very high.

Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank into their own subdirectory called ""Swap Forms"" (look it up just like a person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't know if you can access other subdirectories. We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms directory. Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up. 
Please put your initial on the bottom left of each credit worksheet for easy reference by the attorneys as to which paralegal is handling each workfile. Thank you.

Jeff, thanks for your work on Bob's draft, however, for form management purposes we are going to continue with our previous style which is to include the crossborder annexes. 1.  Attached below is the ENA/US Annex A, which is the base GTC type of document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ENA contracts with a Canadian party we use the Canadian Annex attachment (also attached below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ENA contracts with a foreign counterparty other than Canada, the Canadian Annex may be utilized with additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US. 2.  Attached below is the ECC/Canadian Annex A, which is the base GTC type of document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ECC contracts with a US party we use the United States Annex attachment (also attached below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ECC contracts with a foreign counterparty other than US, the United States Annex may be utilized with additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US. At your convenience, please review the Canadian and United States annexes and advise of any comments.  Thanks again. Note to Paralegals:  Please note that the annexes are now under current forms.  If you have any questions about how they are to be utilized, please stop by to discuss.

Do you have copies of the Alberta and British Columbia Acts?  I know they are less stringent than the US rules, but I don't know the exact levels. 
Speaking of Canadian eligible contract participants...I was told from an originator in Canada that per someone in Enron Canada's legal department, Canadian contract participants are not held to the same standards as US (i.e. they are not required to have minimum assets &/or equity etc.).  Is this true???  Please advise and forward to me the eligible contract participant information we discussed at the happy-hour last wednesday. Thanks WEndy

Mary, I have spoken to Taffy regarding this matter.  She said that even if we move the forms within atty.fms, that the satillite office will still not be able to access them.

Attached below for your review is a proposed short form master agreement for Canadian use on the basis of our prior conversations.  The form is now available for your use under appropriate circumstances.  Use of the form will require credit approval and credit worksheet preparation submitted to Houston legal for preparation, similar to the ISDA procedures for credit review, drafting, and negotiation.  Please inform your working groups of the foregoing.  Susan Bailey will be including this form in our current form bank.

Mary, All those traps with security were worked out 4 years ago.  London can get into the o: drive from there, the only directory they have access to in the o: drive is the atty.fms bank.  If we put the swap forms back there, they can get at them.  I know, because I've pulled them up myself from London. Mary Cook 03/13/01 09:39 AM

Tana, I have a favour - Jon McKay of our office is wondering if you have any record of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction dealing with ""credit sleeving""? All we have here is a copy of an ISDA with them - not what he's looking for. Thanks Linda 403-974-6908

It has come to my attention that a copy of each ECC Isda we finalize should be forwarded to you for your records.  I am not sure that this has been consistently accomplished since I was unaware.  In order to verify that you have all copies, could you send me a listing of all of your Isda ECC files on hand.  I will have it compared to our database and we will copy for you those that you may not have.  Proceeding forward, we will copy you as and when completed.  Thank you.

Bill - If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty. Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system. My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed. In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know. Mark 
CP/ID 94330, Cargill Ferrous International 
CP/ID 94330, Cargill Ferrous International FYI... Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill, Inc. Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure. Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name. Best Rgds.

I have discussed the timing for correction publication issue with our trading desk.  Most price source publications for paper and pulp products are published only on a monthly basis and therefore the 40 days is needed in order to utilize the correction concept, which we do want to be able to utilize.  Thus, we are not in agreement with your proposed amendment.  Please call if you would like to discuss.

I am not sure what kind of paper on the confirmation was sent to them or what they executed.  Was the confirm subject to the master?  I will have Tana forward you what we had last sent them in February.  After you receive it, give me a call.

Mary, we have received an executed copy of the Lakeside financial confirm, which has been confirmed pursuant to the standard 1992 form of ISDA. However, they also executed and returned the execution page of an ISDA base contract.  Since I didn't send them any documents, I assume it came from the documents you provided to them.  Could you do me a favour and forward to me the package of ISDA documents (ie. base contract, schedule, credit support annex, etc.).  Please do not contact the counterparty. Thanks Greg 
We will have our lunch meeting tomorrow.  We will review a few matters previously discussed, assess the status of work and projects, review confirmation signature authority processes, and discuss hedging basis risk discussed in our workbook.

Attached is a report listing all Master Contracts or 'Executed' contracts 
See the attached language per the following. Pursuant to the request of the paper/pulp trading desk via Jay Epstein, the foregoing language should be included in all paper/pulp confirmations prepared as omnibus confirmations.  This language should not be inlcuded where an ISDA is in place because the ISDA already includes pertinent language. MarkTaylor and Tana Jones:  The trading desk has also requested that this language/concept be included in all online transactions via Enron Online or Click Paper.   Tana, please speak with Mark and Jay about how this can be implemented.  Of course, the language will have to be conformed to the online documentation/definitions.

We have determined (Vickers and Tycholiz and Hodge) that no interruptible gas is transacted on line, but certain firm gas descriptions excuse performance on the basis of normal pipeline constraints (without liability).  Therefore, for Phase 1 rollout no EOL interruptible/spot GTC is needed.  In Phase 3 they may consider adding some interruptible products on line.  They do want an over the counter interruptible GTC, which will be prepared.  In any event, all EOL physical gas will be sold online in Phase 1 under the Firm GTC (until masters are signed).  The Phase 1 EOL decision tree will then be if GISB master signed, up to 30 day firm gas under GISB, over 30 under Firm GTC.  If Firm master signed, all gas under Firm master.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical ""(including automatic termination, if applicable)"" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included. Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

As you are aware a ""safety net"" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement. Any questions, call me.

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language. 2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns. See attached reline version to read the changes. 3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex. 4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler. The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to ""kill"" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1). Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (713) 646-3393 (fax)

The following points. All final revisions accepted other than as noted below. Please provide us by separate cover the generic risk disclosure as we do not intend to use it as an exhibit. Rounding:  I added liters at 5 decimal places (to coordinate with gallons). Cross Default Threshold is at 150,000,000 for all Enron parties. Part 7 revisions not completely accepted.  Please review and call, I will explain.  Note the ETA currently is between ENA on its behalf and on behalf of all affiliates.  It does not make sense to assign it. We are verifying our consent to your change in the Interest Rate definition. Please review collateral threshold to be sure it is as our credit departments agreed.  I believe it is.

By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps. Paul_Puchot@enron.net 06/07/2001 11:28 AM 
Elizabeth, We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd been negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential use in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would

Per conversation with christian, and prior discussions with cadwalader i think the memo of cad is off on cross default too.  i had noted such on my first read.  i thought what we were after was if one leg is set aside in a bankruptcy then all legs are ""set aside"" this being different than defaulted.

Great memo! Just a couple of notes. B 1 (b):  I think the master gas contract form includes Affiliates on non-defaulting party side--see end of Article 4. If a Triggering Event occurs, the Notifying Party may (at its election) set off any or all amounts which the Affected Party owes to the Notifying Party or its Affiliates (under this Agreement or otherwise) against any or all amounts which the Notifying Party owes to the Affected Party (either under this Agreement or otherwise). B 2 (f):  The analysis is based upon Enron default.  If counterparty default analysis is used, Enron benefits; and don't all contracts at least have all transactions terminating if bankruptcy is the triggering event?

No. 79 Tuesday April 24, 2001	Page A-33 ISSN 1523-567X Regulation, Law & Economics BankruptcyDaschle Says Bankruptcy Reform Stuck As Party Roles in Conference Still in Limbo Bankruptcy legislation (S. 420/H.R. 333) that separately passed the Senate and House earlier this spring remains in limbo, as the Senate still cannot agree on how to proceed to conference with the House, Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters April 23. The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in conference, while Republicans oppose it. Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions. ""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until

All, attached is a redline of Master Netting Agreement against the previous Cook c draft and the proposed Collateral Annex.  Please review and provide your comments to me by first thing Tuesday morning. Major issues for resolution: 1.  We have determined that we should file on cash collateral in Canada.  Peter Keohane is reviewing the forms and processes for such, including how to determine and establish priority with respect to same.  Peter will coordinate with Credit concerning the mechanics of accomplishing the filings. 2.  Due to the continued concern by some counsel in respect of mutuality issues for setoff and netted settlement (another form of setoff) ""aggregate liability clauses"" set forth in 3a and 3b have been included for our consideration.  We must come to a consensus as to whether this language/concept should/must be included.  If the answer is yes, is the language included the best tactic? 3.  Mary Perkins is reviewing LC matters with banks to be sure the modified format set forth in this draft is satisfactory. Timing Objective:  Our objective is to provide everyone another draft on Tuesday and finalize on Wednesday.  This will require a conference call sometime Monday afternoon.  Carol, Rick, David, Peter and Elizabeth please provide Esmeralda Gonzalez, my assistant, at 713 345-7621 with your Monday afternoon availability and she will set a time and advise you. For those of you who had a prior draft of the Collateral Annex, I could not get this redlined for some reason, I apologize. Carol, since I am out Friday will you please call Cadwalader and be sure they received this.  Further, will you ask them to review the NY choice of law provision in light of Canada cash collateral issue.  Thank you. David and Rick, in your review please give special attention to the calculation mechanisms utilized for the determination of the Collateral Requirement.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical ""(including automatic termination, if applicable)"" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included. Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

To my knowledge there are a variety of prepay forms of transactions. 1.  Some older forms were physically based (I think primarily with respect to gas and with Chase).  Teresa Bushman and/or Dan Lyons worked on these transactions). 2.  Newer forms are triangulated swaps.  There are a series with Citibank, related to credit link notes (see Gareth Bahlmann re link notes), known as Yosemite/Delta Transactions.  There are 4 in the series (4th series had three prepays, US, Sterling and Euro).  The 5th did not close. 3.  There is at least one other with Citibank, dated June 2001 and it is being wrapped into the pipeline credit facility and will be extinguished via the placement of the pipeline facility. 4.  I am aware of one other (via the London office) which was extended September 2001, among Credit Suisse First Boston and ENA and Barclays. I suggest you contact Lisa Bills, Joe Deffner and Dan Boyle to determine a complete list.  I believe that this detail may have been determined by one of the teams formed last week.  You may wish to check with Haedicke. In respect of accounting treatment, and book treatment, I suggest the following names:  Alan Quaintance, Clint Walden re accounting.  Dan Boyle has a name of someone who worked on placing the Delta transactions in the risk books, but I cannot remember the name.

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language. 2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns. See attached reline version to read the changes. 3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex. 4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler. The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to ""kill"" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1). Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (713) 646-3393 (fax)

No. 79 Tuesday April 24, 2001	Page A-33 ISSN 1523-567X Regulation, Law & Economics BankruptcyDaschle Says Bankruptcy Reform Stuck As Party Roles in Conference Still in Limbo Bankruptcy legislation (S. 420/H.R. 333) that separately passed the Senate and House earlier this spring remains in limbo, as the Senate still cannot agree on how to proceed to conference with the House, Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters April 23. The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in conference, while Republicans oppose it. Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions. ""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until 
Great memo! Just a couple of notes. B 1 (b):  I think the master gas contract form includes Affiliates on non-defaulting party side--see end of Article 4. If a Triggering Event occurs, the Notifying Party may (at its election) set off any or all amounts which the Affected Party owes to the Notifying Party or its Affiliates (under this Agreement or otherwise) against any or all amounts which the Notifying Party owes to the Affected Party (either under this Agreement or otherwise). B 2 (f):  The analysis is based upon Enron default.  If counterparty default analysis is used, Enron benefits; and don't all contracts at least have all transactions terminating if bankruptcy is the triggering event?

Per conversation with christian, and prior discussions with cadwalader i think the memo of cad is off on cross default too.  i had noted such on my first read.  i thought what we were after was if one leg is set aside in a bankruptcy then all legs are ""set aside"" this being different than defaulted.

Sara/Mary - I'm not sure which of you to direct this question to, so I'll ask you both and either can run with it....... I am attaching a confirmation for the paper product OCC#11.  The desk came back to me with modifications to incorporate that change this into a type of confirmation I have never done before.  So I need some help: - This will be an American Call Swaption.  The Buyer has the option to settle physically or financially into a call. - For financial settlement: Exercise periods:  May 1 - May31 to exercise the June period June 1 - June 30 to exercise the July period July 1 - July 31 to exercise to August period (close of business 4:30 EST) - For physical settlment: Exercise periods are the same as for financial settlement - If they exercise physically, the Seller must be allowed at least 30 days to deliver 2000 short tons per month for each Determination Period at the defined Location. - The language they gave me for the Floating Price is: The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be based off the arithmetic average fo the bid/offer price based off www.clickpaper.com at the time of exercising the call option (US Physical OCC#11 FAS Port Elizabeth Harbor, Spot month) I'm attaching a copy of the original confirmation I generated , using just the info that was on the ticket. (clearly the ticket was lacking a lot of important things, and incorrect on others)....you can use it to incorporate the necessary changes if you'd like, or start from scratch. Let me know what other info you might need and I'll try to get it from either the desk or from the physcial confirms group. Thanks a lot, Diane

Karolina in my group will contact Mark.  Karolina investigated the transaction and transacting entity to ensure that no CredReserve was required.  She will also ensure the documentation is acceptable. Typically, on deals such as this (financing related) the lender will dictate the terms - to avoid subordination or early termination events. Rod

I got a call from Jason Williams on this file.  As it turns out, in his review of the annual report of Welch he noted that it stated that Welch is a cooperative.  The original draft of the ISDA was not drafted with this knowledge as there was no indication from any source that Welch was a cooperative.  This fact needs to be confirmed, and if Welch is a cooperative, you will need to research the issue.

Jesus thinks it not probable that they would do so at this time, but rather lock in a few days before the VPP transaction.  B of A economics would be different.  However, it does seem that B of A should be consulted.

Credit... Notice # 01-186 June 1, 2001 TO: All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain Securitie= s=20 and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and COMEX Transacti= ons DATE: June 1, 2001 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D= =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D 1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to= =20 Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX=20 Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1,=20 2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit= =20 with their Clearing Members for margin purposes. 2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are= =20 further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will ser= ve=20 as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for use o= n=20 a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained from the= =20 Exchange=01,s Clearing Department. 3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint= =20 Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard=20 Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for Joi= nt=20 Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used = as=20 margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint=20 Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used a= s=20 margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association = as=20 one of the Joint Beneficiaries. 4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under =20 applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidia= ry=20 or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing= =20 House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank parent or= =20 affiliate bank. As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule=20 changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and=20 deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin=20 requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use = of=20 such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions. Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit (LCs= )=20 now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions. Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20 changes allow letters of credit to be used on a ""pass-through"" basis on bot= h=20 divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able= =20 to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. = It=20 should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, a= s=20 detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets m= ay=20 not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin= =20 obligations with the clearinghouse. Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing=20 Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable=20 securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim= e=20 on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customer= s=20 to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member= s=20 on either division: securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the= =20 American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter= =20 market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve= =20 Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;= =20 can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o= ne=20 issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market=20 value. Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse=20 receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted= =20 as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at = no=20 more than 75% of the value of the commodity. If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20 Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)= =20 299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,=20 NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice=20 President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.

See the attached drafts for your review and comment.  The preswaps on gas and crude have been distributed for execution by Diane Anderson.  As discussed last week, and approved by the gas structure desk, the basis swap has been imbedded in the gas swap for the outyears and in the gas assignment and amendment document.  Should you have any comments, please advise. I will need prices and schedules to complete the swap paper.  Remember, schedules are to be at 97%.  Further, Jesus is to advise of how the 3% volumes remaining between KCS Energy and ENA under the preswaps are to be handled so that appropriate paper can be drafted. As and when a closing day is set, please advise.

I suggest the attached language be substituted for the current language in the schedules in respect of Engineering Report where  a PV/PDP mac is utilized.

It seems to me that in our omnibus forms, there is no rounding rule applicable to the return of collateral.  However, credit worksheets often ask for the rounding rule to apply to both delivery and return (similar to master).  Could you look at the forms at your convenience and let me know if I am missing something?  If not, I will ask Mark if he thinks we should

Also, can you create a list of all margin financing agreements in place and the rates we pay. Thanks, John 
Please review this email from David Dupre on confirm desk.  He has been inquiring of me re credit lines the last few weeks.  The margin cash issues seem to be getting a bit of attention lately.  However, these are new brokerage agreements or amendments or amplifications of established accounts to trade other commodities.  I have the paperwork Refco sent.  Maybe we should sent down and visit re all of the brokerage matters.  Should I handle these, or stick with the ones related to margin lines.  Should we send this kind of stuff to Jason?  Please advise.  Mary 
Hi, 1. Refco Refco's paperwork will be submitted to you today to review.

Cargill Our traders want to renew crude oil trading with Cargill at a lower rate. Which legal documents do we need to sign to ensure that this lower commission rate is established and honored? 3. GNI-Next advisors We are talking to Stephen Purdy upon the request of Spencer Vosko. We have been advised that the rate will be $5.25 on a roundturn basis. This broker will be forwarded their paperwork to the trader, and, I'll ensure that you receive it.

Sara advised you were working a project re McGarret/Hawaii125.  I will forward emails I got today related to same shortly.  There also seems to be a ""Tahiti"" deal which is tracked off of Hawaii.  I have captured the Raptor III docs which Carol forwarded from VE.  Raptor II is closed.  I guess III is another cookie cutter of I and II.  Do you want Sara or I to look over Raptor III?  Maybe Sara, you and I should convene to discuss how we will handle all 
Sara advised that we are reconsidering the staffing of the multitude of structured finance transactions which include swaps.  In connection with such considerations, please see the last note on the attached email from Sefton. I will cover Raptor 3 for now.  Mary 
Raptor 3 is now on. It will be the same as Raptor 2. We're also now going to do Raptor 4, a radically different structure using RESCO warrants. More info to follow  on that. MARY COOK 08/29/2000 06:44 PM 
I will await your direction as new documents are distributed.  Mary 
This deal is in being restructured to use Resco warrants instead of Enron common stock. As a result, I suggest you hold off on reviewing the docs at this time. Thanks! MARY COOK 08/29/2000 03:09 PM 
Clarification:  Only the Master ISDA between Roadrunner and Bobcat. 
Carol St. Clair has forwarded to me the Raptor III documents.  I will review only the Master ISDA which I presume is similar to the prior drafts and is intended to work the same role in the structure.  Please advise if you need me to review any other aspect of the transaction which is all otherwise being drafted by VE.  Mary 
I.  I thought it would be helpful to put the following in writing for everyone based upon our conversations with Ron Astin. In making ownership determinations the following applies: 1.  Where warrants are also owned: warrants (exercisable within 60 days by ""Enron"") + stock owned ________________________________________________________________ warrants (exercisable within 60 days by ""Enron"") + stock issued and outstanding 2.  Where preferred shares are owned: If preferred class is public, it must be included. If preferred class is private, but convertible to common public, it must be included. If preferred class is private (and not convertible to common public), and we do not own 10% of any other class that is public, then it does not need to be included. 3.  Where the shares are owned via a joint arrangement of any type, please be sure that the share numbers that are being reviewed and to be provided to 
Based upon discussions with Andrea Reed, the res of the swap will be the warrant itself, not the underlying stock.  The warrants are valued separately with a ""warrant model"" and carry a price of their own differentiated from, although affected by, the stock price.  I did not get into further detail on the specifics of the modeling.  The will provide us the number of warrants, the strike price as of August 3.  Otherwise they will work similarly to the stock based swap I think.  She said they do not plan to exercise them, but 
See attached and provide me with your comments. 
1.  I was not sure whose doc the referenced notice was, but I think the address should be Talon c/o LJM2@ Co-Investment, L.P.  rather than just to Talon. 2.  Vargas met with me last night.  I am printing out and copying proposal sheets and valuations and stock ownership (the latter of which they are making corrections to and resending this morning.  My asst. is coordinating a meeting with Stuart, Sara and myself this morning to coordinate further review actions and swap preparation. 3.  Based upon the latest voice from Sefton re note adjustment, I checked with A. Currey and she advised that nothing need be said in the swap re same as the structure docs will automatically cause payment via adjustment. 
You will provide Tana and I with the Canadian conversion language for the

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL. I think I am one of the people who raised the issue about the Asset Description in my mark-up of the Raptor I Derivative Proposal Sheet that I received this am from Stuart and returned to him midday. As I read the memo below, I am instructed to advise you about the nature of the underlying asset. The asset is Series B Preferred Stock of Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., and an option to acquire same. Currently, pursuant to a Series B Stock Purchase Agreement among Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. ( CCSI), Catalytica, Inc. ( CCSI's parent and currently holder of Series A and common stock of CCSI representing approximately 83% of the ownership of CCSI ) and Enron Ventures Corp. ( predecessor in interest to Sundance Assets, L.P.), Sundance owns 1,339,286 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and an option to purchase 535,715 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. There are provisions calling for the adjustment of the number of option shares subject to the option but I am not aware that any transactions that would cause such adjustment provisions, other that the stock split referred to below, to apply. The Series B stock is convertible to CCSI common stock, is restricted stock, and the Stock Purchase Agreement provides for registration rights. Currently, Tom White and Jack Urquhart both serve on the CCSI Boards of Directors, and Jack serves on the Catalytica Inc. Board. Under an Omnibus Agreement entered into in September 2000, in connection with the restructuring of Enron's transactions with CCSI and in connection with the proposed acquisition of Catalytica, Inc, by a third party ( DSM, a Dutch pharmaceutical company)  and the distribution of Catalytica's CCSI shares to Catalytica's stockholders immediately prior to that acquisition, we agreed to convert the Series B to CCSI common, agreed to vote for a 2 for 1 stock split, and negotiated a cashless exercise of the option after the effective date of the spin off. The effectiveness of these provisions is dependent upon the effectiveness of distribution and acquisition The option itself ( as amended by the Omnibus Agreement and otherwise ) expires January 14, 2001. The distribution is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2000, but is subject to a variety of conditions. After the distribution and concurrent closing of the Catalyica acquisition transaction, CCSI ( which formerly looked to its parent for financing and much of its administrative and other support) will be a stand- alone public company listed on NASDAQ, with the uncertainties attendant thereto. The Omnibus Agreement also contains provisions amending Sundance's registration rights, the board representation provisions in the original Stock Purchase Agreement, and certain transfer restrictions ( to liberalize them and allow the Raptor transaction to take place). There are also agreements related to Enron North America's Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement with GE and West LB, which do not directly affect the Series B Preferred. These provisions instead go to the development program for CCSI's technology, to which ENA contributes funding, and conform that agreement to a change in CCSI's and GE's strategy for commercializing the technology. The funding obligation itself is interconnected with the turbine purchases for ENA's Pastoria project in California, but I don't believe that transaction needs analysis for these purposes, To comply with SEC rules in connection with the distribution, CCSI has filed an S-1 registration statement registering the CCSI common stock to be distributed to Catalytica's shareholders with the SEC, and Catalytica, Inc. has filed a merger proxy statement with the SEC in connection with its solicitation of Catalytica stockholder approval to the acquisition transaction. Comments are expected from  the SEC in 4 to 6 weeks. Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this matter further, and I am instructed to request that you return the revised copy of the Raptor I Proposal Sheet to me and copy Mary Cook and Lisa Mellancamp thereon. The foregoing description may be more than you need for the summary, but it really is a very abbreviated snapshot of the transaction. All the documents related to the Preferred Stock and Option, including the executed Omnibus Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement, have been previously delivered to Sara Shackleton and Hope Vargas. 
It has come to my attention that questions have been raised in reviewing the Raptor I Derivative Proposal Sheets regarding the type of information that should be set forth in the category entitled ""ASSET DESCRIPTION"".  The Master Derivatives Agreement (""MDA"") requires that the Proposal Sheets describe the ""Assets"" with respect to which the derivative transaction is to be executed. For purposes of the MDA, ""Assets"" is defined as ""assets, including without limitation common stock, partnership interests, member interests. other ownership interests, and other financial and physical assets.""  Therefore, the description should include both the nature of the ""Asset"" (i.e. whether it is an equity interest, a loan, working interest, etc.) and a little bit about the company (the entity in which ENA holds the interest or has the loan or working interest). Any comments to the Proposal Sheets should be delivered ASAP to the ""Enron person completing this form"" (This is the 3rd line under the heading ""GENERAL"" on each of the Proposal Sheets) along with a request that a revised Proposal Sheet be returned to the lawyer providing comments with copies to both Mary Cook and Lisa Mellencamp. The pressure to complete these Raptor hedges remains high and therefore your immediate attention is greatly appreciated.  Many thanks. Stuart

A couple of clarifications to the Proposal itself. The option to acquire 535,715 additional shares is in place now and is currently exercisable by payment of the $26.88 per share strike price, but after effectiveness of the CCSI S-1 related to the spin-off, we have the option to exercise the option on a cashless basis and the shares will be split 2 for 1.

We will be completing the Raptor 1 swaps by this Friday's deadline as requested of Sefton's group.  I am not sure which of you will be replacing Julia Murray's role in coordinating the work of the finance group on Raptor's 2, 3, 4 programs and beyond; however, within the next few days, please let me know so that I can set a meeting with you to discuss processes and procedures for future securities and investment review in connection with the preparation of the swaps.  Raptor 1 processes were fine for the first round, but a number of changes should be made for future programs to improve information flow, logistics, and division of labor.  Advise this week, and then next week I will set a time to meet for discussion. Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
I understand that Sara and I will visit with you Monday about this project. Attached are two updated forms of the equity swaps we have created thus far for warrants and shares with public/private options, and language to cover conversions of preferred, or rights to exercise warrants, that are not 1 to 1.  Additionally, I learned late Friday that the materials I sent to you by fax last week are not the most current amendments to the Oconto Falls transaction.  You will be receiving another fax Monday morning. Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
Sara, attached is my draft for partnership interests based upon the Juniper LP.  Andrea has agreed that as to partnership interests, the mutual termination right is only for the entire interest and we  do not need to draft in partial termination rights so the Notice, if given, will always be for the entire interest.  I have fixed Equity Notional Amount and this makes the numbers work.  I modified Method of Adjustment to cover any event of dilution or conversion (but did not specifically say in sole discretion of Calc Agent)--this will cover primarily the effect of the addition of new partners to the partnership.  I also left in Extraordinary Events as we have previously syled same since partnership interests could be sold, exchanged, rolled up to a master partnership etc.  It is not perfect, but it seems to cover those types of events adequately.  Give me a call Monday morning and we can call Jean.  Again, thanks for your help on Friday.  Mary Enron North America Corp.

Due to options outstanding for Catalytica that have a separate value from the preferred shares that we already carry, we have created two Raptor proposal sheets for the assets.  One for the Catalytica options and one for the preferred shares. Please review the following documents and let me know if you have any questions. Brenda Whitehead@ECT 09/15/2000 02:25 PM

Attached is an update of what has been complete and what is outstanding.  We are missing 4 valuations; Amerada Hess, LSI Preferred (We have the warrants), Merlin Credit Derivative and Chewco SLP.  Of the 31 privates plus Chewco SLP, we have proposal sheets and confirms for only 7.  The publics have all been received. We need to have the valuations, proposal sheets and confirms to Talon by Wednesday for their lawyers to review.  The deadline is still to have everything completed by this week. Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks, Gordon Gordon McKillop 09/15/2000 01:51 PM 
I have been informed that all the documentation for the Raptor swaps and confirmations needs to be completed and finalized by next week, 9/18-22. Talon will not accept any documentation after this date.  Please let me know if there are any problems. Thanks, Gordon 
The attached swaps will be delivered by hard copy batch, together with the revised proposal sheets and a copy of the legal worksheets, to Julia Chin today.  Upon receipt, Julia will attach the valuation data that has been previously provided to her by Hope Vargas and coordinate execution. Enron North America Corp.

Mary, Attached is the list of administrative assistants in the department who work overtime. 
Attached is a revised proposal sheet and swap confirmation for the captioned underlying partnership interest.  The notional value has been changed in both, and EGF has been added as a business unit to the proposal.  The prior valuation did not include the SLP/Chewco interest that is covered by the swap.  Hopefully, this will correct any confusion. Julia Chin should substitute the following for the hard copies previously provided to her.  If you have any questions, please advise.  Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
For those of you involved in any Raptor equity investments out of JEDI I, I have been advised by Andrea Reed that Chewco Investments purchased a position in JEDI I.  Chewco is owned in part by an Enron entity.  The result is that Enron entities now have a 96.12% interest in JEDI I (60% ENA + 36.12% EGF based upon Chewco).  I hope this is helpful in your review of the Raptor matters.  The closing binders are in the file room for you to review if you need to verify the materials.   Thank you.

The attached swaps will be delivered by hard copy batch, together with the revised proposal sheets and a copy of the legal worksheets, to Gordon McKillop, in Julia Chin's absence, today.  Upon receipt, Gordon will attach the valuation data that has been previously provided to Julia Chin by Hope Vargas and coordinate execution. First, additional publics representing the incremental interests of Chewco, then followed by numerous privates.  As of now, we still are working Catalytica and Merlin. Enron North America Corp.

I have left you each a voice mail, but wanted to be sure to try to catch the issue with you by email as well. We received a fax today at 3 with some comments from K&E on the swaps.  Please note that we have processed most all of the swaps and are now working on Merlin and Catalytica which are more complex.  Julia Chin and I have reviewed the comments and feel that they are not substantive and only reflect different wording styles.  At this juncture we would request that you assess whether or not our time is well spent reprocessing all of the swaps on the basis of the K&E comments.  Please consider these matters as soon as you can obtain a copy of their mark-ups and advise me.  In order that I be most productive I intend to continue my work on the Merlin Credit Derivative while awaiting your direction on these other nonsubstantive changes.  Therefore, the subject swaps will not now be reprocessed.  Thank you.  Mary Enron North America Corp.

Attached are the swap forms we have utilized in round one of the raptor off balance sheet swap project.  I have tried to clean them, and have also incorporated comments received thus far from Kirkland & Ellis, firm for Talon.  Please review these forms and provide any further comments or suggestions to them by Tuesday morning of next week.   As I mentioned, we plan to forward to you proposal sheets as and when received for all the remaining swaps to be placed into the raptor vehicles for preparation of the swaps by your firm.  We should know more about the timing of the next round of swaps next week.  As other and varied investments may be placed in the vehicles, we will ask that your firm develop the forms to be used on the basis of the proposals and any documents applicable to the underlying investment.  Finally, please finalize the memorandum on termination and forward to my attention next week, if possible. Thank you for your continued assistance.  Please confirm receipt and ability to have comments to me by Tuesday. Mary Enron North America Corp.

Scott has advised that he and Julia Chin cannot attend the Raptor processes meeting, and at his request we will cancel and reschedule.  My assistant will be contacting you to set up a new date after quarter end. Scott, by this memo, per your voice mail, if you would like to get together early next week to discuss the suggested process, just give me a call.  Mary Enron North America Corp.

Pursuant to the request to have the partneship and membership interests be partially terminable as the other investments, attached are revised swaps reflecting such rights in the same manner as reflected in the other equity swaps.  The attached cover all the partnerships and llcs on my list.  If I omitted any, please call.  Please print these out and substitute for prior swaps.  No hard copies will be sent separately.

Thanks for your additional comments.  Attached are all the revised forms to put into your system.  The major concept addition is a partial termination right in the partnership and membership forms in the same format as the share swap form.  I will let you know (hopefully with some lead time!) when additional swaps are to be prepared for Raptor 2, 3, 4. Enron North America Corp.

I am currently working on a new ISDA wherein the counterparty is a US sub of a foreign Guarantor.  Upon consulting with Rhett Jackson in Tax, he thought we needed to work a form of the tax reps into the guaranty since the Guarantor was foreign.  I see the same issue arising in respect of certain other amendments on which I am working.  Rhett is looking over this matter now and I will advise.    Any thoughts? Enron North America Corp.

Regarding the H1250 swaps that are to be written today, please note that the swap group will not be reviewing the underlying asset for confidentiality or securities issues etc.  It was my understanding that the swap will be struck after TNPC goes public, but at what juncture of Enron's ownership may be hard to tell.  In any event, I presume your group is analyzing all these matters with Ron Astin.  Mary Enron North America Corp.

Sara Shackleton and I are the primary swap team assigned to the preparation of swaps to be placed into the Raptor structures.  We have previously worked with Sefton and Chin in coordinating the processes involved.  Having completed Raptor 1 swaps, and some of the Raptor 2 and 3 swaps, I discussed with Sefton what I considered to be an improvement to the processes and work allocation between the various groups involved.  We were to have a meeting with the various people involved last week, but given the changes in staff in your group and Andrea Reed's move, I thought it best to wait a week.  My assistant, Chaundra Woods, will be coordinating the meeting.  I would request that either you, or another attorney who will assist in the future, or both, attend.  We have retained Julia Chin on the working group list, but she did not originally work on Raptor. Thanks.  Mary Enron North America Corp.

The Raptor process meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, October 24, 2000 at 10:00 a.m. in EB38C1. 
A.  You will be sent: 1.  Drafts of the Yosemite 3 confirmations (Gina Karathonos (Global Fiannce paralegal) will follow up with executed versions when we receive them from Milbank Tweed). 2.  Copies of the executed swaps that were done in connection with Raptor 1. B.  Attached below are the final drafts of 3 swaps that were done in connection with Raptor 3. Brenda Funk will provide you with copies of the executed versions of these swaps as soon as possible. C.  Sara is working on Raptor 2 swaps.  You may wish to contact her regarding the status of these particular confirmations. By copy of this memo to Gina and Brenda, please provide me with executed versions as well.  Thank you.

Joe Hunter has requested that in the future he be provided copies of all confirmations in respect of any structured finance transactions in which we participate.  To the extent we cannot quickly get executed versions, he would like to receive the final draft versions.  I will discuss coordinating this with Global Finance Legal during our Raptor process meeting next week. Enron North America Corp.

FYI.  How all of this may work with respect to the swaps in these structures (which I believe to have been signed, but still have not been provided executed copies) is unclear.

FYI. Mark -- lets give some thought to how this effects both structure and the ability to give the FAS 125 opinions on the sale of the notes on Raptor 3. 
At AMT's and/or Brent's convenience, I would like to better understand the tax issue and discuss what steps we can take to mitigate as this proposal has real momentum. Thanks. Jordan 
Per discussion with Lance this morning, the ""underwriting"" aspects of the EITF swaps are in the nature of a cash make-whole; therefore, I wonder if it is an appropriate concept for EITF equity classification.  I am not going to put it into the Talon swap. Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax)

Note that we had an extensive call with NatWest on Wednesday and are considering some of their issues for next draft of term sheet.  We will keep you posted.

Jim, thanks for being so responsive.  Attached please find the latest draft of term sheet for the Joshua Tree transaction.  We continue to negotiate with the banks but want to get this to you so you can get up to speed on transaction structure.  Basically, banks would invest in certificates of a Delaware business trust of which Wilmington would be trustee.  The trust in turn would be the limited partner in a Texas limited partnership.  The managing partner of the limited partnership would be Enron North America Corp. or another Enron subsidiary.  The limited partnership would invest in volumetric production payments.   Note that names given in term sheet for new entities may change. Tim Proffitt is the Enron commercial lead on this transaction.  John Rain of Thompson & Knight (Dallas) is our outside counsel.  Robin Miles of Bracewell & Patterson (Houston) is representing Bank of America.  Thompson & Knight is doing initial draft of trust agreement (starting with Margaux form). Let us know particulars of your team and counsel (names, firms, office and home contact info) and we will add them to the working group list and distribute.  The goal is to have this transaction closed by December 15, 2000. Thanks again and let me know as you need additional information. Regards, NJD Nora J.

hello mary thanks for for your note. we don't currently have a central legal database of opinions from various legal jurisdictions, although it is envisaged that in due course we will pull these together onto a central database.  i would certainly welcome any thoughts/ideas you may have in this respect regards justin MARY COOK 06/02/2001 20:45 
Hi Justin.  It has been quite some time.  I hope all is well with you.  I am back after teaching for a year--it was fun and I received my certification (hopefully for later use.) Sara Shackleton mentioned that at one time your office created (and perhaps still updates and utilizes) a legal opinion database with respect to physical and financial trading matters in various jurisdictions.  Could you advise if this is the case?  If so, I would like to visit with you about it.  If this is not within your purview, could you forward this to the correct person and advise me of whom that would be.

QG7130.1, NY2665.1 and NY5271.1 
Especially item 4.  As I had noted previously the payment date issue is arising often in Canada. Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) mary.cook@enron.com 
QG7130.1, NY2665.1 and NY5271.1 Premstar Energy Canada has requested that the Payment Dates for the above noted financial transactions be amended to conform with physical settlement from ""The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable"" to ""The twenty fifth (25th) day of the month following each Determination Period.  Should the Payment Date fall on a weekend or statutory holiday, payment shall be made on the next Business Day."". My comments are as follows: 1. Russell, kindly confirm that there is no credit concern with extending the financial payment cycle; 2. Laura/Cheryl, kindly confirm that it is something that we have done in the past for financial transactions; 3. Melinda, assuming that Russell, Laura/Cheryl do not have concerns, please prepare an amendment to each of the Confirmation Letters as requested by Premstar, except that the final sentence of their requested amendment should read:  ""Should the Payment Date fall on a Saturday or statutory holiday other than a Monday, then payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, and if the Payment Date is a Sunday or statutory holiday falling on a Monday, then payment shall be made on the immediately following Business Day."".  This will make the Payment Dates consistent with physical gas settlement. 4. Melinda, if this amendment is not approved by Russell, Laura or Cheryl, I think that an amendment is nonetheless necessary to the Payment Date, as it is not the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable, but rather the fifth (5th) Business Day of the month following each Determination Period. 5. If possible, Premstar would like the amendment to be effective for the February, 2001 Determination Period. 6. Premstar would also like this provision to extend to any and all future Financial Swap transactions done with them.  Mary, is there any amendment required to the ISDA to effect such a permanent amendment, or is this a matter that can be dealt with in each subsequent confirmation letter? Regards, 
You would not need to amend the ISDA.  Payment Dates are stated in the confirmations.  Regarding your item 4, you might wish to talk to Sara concerning the history of the payment date as 5th after determinable.  The issue has been discussed often over the years between settlements and treasury.

No.  I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the correct parties etc.  Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of inapplicable specifics) .    We ought to also check with Joel about any provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment. I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be clean from the ISDA point of view.

Ladies, Could one of you please tell me what is Legal's position on generating confirms for EOL trades?  I was under the impression (evidently false) that we did NOT send confirms for gas  deals done on EOL.  I did hear that legal was currently reviewing this issue.  Do you know where it stands, or who the best person to contact about this would be?  Please let me know. We are looking to do some confirm automation (at last, at last!) and one of the issues we are looking at is do we REALLY need to send paper confirms for trades done on EOL.  It seems that it would just give someone one more chance to dispute the trade. Mary, I was at the DCAF conference where you spoke on the issue of electronic confirmtions and on line trading, but I don't remember how far Enron was on these issues. Sara,  It seems like we talked about this as part of a larger conversation on web-based confirms. I would be grateful to hear both of your thoughts/concerns related to the above. Thanks very much for your help!

Jeff, thanks for your work on Bob's draft, however, for form management purposes we are going to continue with our previous style which is to include the crossborder annexes. 1.  Attached below is the ENA/US Annex A, which is the base GTC type of document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ENA contracts with a Canadian party we use the Canadian Annex attachment (also attached below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ENA contracts with a foreign counterparty other than Canada, the Canadian Annex may be utilized with additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US. 2.  Attached below is the ECC/Canadian Annex A, which is the base GTC type of document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ECC contracts with a US party we use the United States Annex attachment (also attached below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ECC contracts with a foreign counterparty other than US, the United States Annex may be utilized with additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US. At your convenience, please review the Canadian and United States annexes and advise of any comments.  Thanks again. Note to Paralegals:  Please note that the annexes are now under current forms.  If you have any questions about how they are to be utilized, please stop by to discuss.

There is a possibility that Mariner will be going into Raptor.  In preparation for that, I am proposing that we start the Raptor process for Mariner by preliminarily completing the Raptor proposal sheet and the Raptor legal checklist response form.

1.  Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.  If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.  Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well. 2.  At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.

As you are aware a ""safety net"" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement. Any questions, call me. Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (713) 646-3393 (fax) 
1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language. 2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns. See attached reline version to read the changes. 3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex. 4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler. The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to ""kill"" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1). Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas 77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (713) 646-3393 (fax)

X will give Y noti= ce of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after t= he setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not a= ffect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, ""Owed"" sha= ll mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of wh= ether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Terminat= ion Date. Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by= X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rat= e of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, = would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being convert= ed.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that o= bligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant pa= rty accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in= this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security inter= est except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision = shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting= , offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to whi= ch X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by= operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents = and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral = part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the= parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the part= ies further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of i= tself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of= its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Sectio= n and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agr= eement as it relates to this Section. (B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreeme= nt, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, sha= ll not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amo= unt under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party= receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (whi= ch may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any= kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined her= ein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any pay= ments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affil= iates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) o= r undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof ha= ve been fully and finally satisfied. The following are three areas of questions. A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section= 7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's ""priority"" position (assumin= g Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct? 1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff= rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setof= f right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables.=20 2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron h= as made no public filings) without Enron's written consent? =20 B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignmen= t provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we= may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the maste= r agreement and transactions ""as security"".  Please review and advise of an= y particular language you think should be added. =20 C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) p= rovision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the= end of 7(b), "";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subje= ct [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all =

I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow. Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical ""(including automatic termination, if applicable)"" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included. Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

Sara, attached is my draft for partnership interests based upon the Juniper LP.  Andrea has agreed that as to partnership interests, the mutual termination right is only for the entire interest and we  do not need to draft in partial termination rights so the Notice, if given, will always be for the entire interest.  I have fixed Equity Notional Amount and this makes the numbers work.  I modified Method of Adjustment to cover any event of dilution or conversion (but did not specifically say in sole discretion of Calc Agent)--this will cover primarily the effect of the addition of new partners to the partnership.  I also left in Extraordinary Events as we have previously syled same since partnership interests could be sold, exchanged, rolled up to a master partnership etc.  It is not perfect, but it seems to cover those types of events adequately.  Give me a call Monday morning and we can call Jean.  Again, thanks for your help on Friday.  Mary Enron North America Corp.

A couple of clarifications to the Proposal itself. The option to acquire 535,715 additional shares is in place now and is currently exercisable by payment of the $26.88 per share strike price, but after effectiveness of the CCSI S-1 related to the spin-off, we have the option to exercise the option on a cashless basis and the shares will be split 2 for 1.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL. I think I am one of the people who raised the issue about the Asset Description in my mark-up of the Raptor I Derivative Proposal Sheet that I received this am from Stuart and returned to him midday. As I read the memo below, I am instructed to advise you about the nature of the underlying asset. The asset is Series B Preferred Stock of Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., and an option to acquire same. Currently, pursuant to a Series B Stock Purchase Agreement among Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. ( CCSI), Catalytica, Inc. ( CCSI's parent and currently holder of Series A and common stock of CCSI representing approximately 83% of the ownership of CCSI ) and Enron Ventures Corp. ( predecessor in interest to Sundance Assets, L.P.), Sundance owns 1,339,286 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and an option to purchase 535,715 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. There are provisions calling for the adjustment of the number of option shares subject to the option but I am not aware that any transactions that would cause such adjustment provisions, other that the stock split referred to below, to apply. The Series B stock is convertible to CCSI common stock, is restricted stock, and the Stock Purchase Agreement provides for registration rights. Currently, Tom White and Jack Urquhart both serve on the CCSI Boards of Directors, and Jack serves on the Catalytica Inc. Board. Under an Omnibus Agreement entered into in September 2000, in connection with the restructuring of Enron's transactions with CCSI and in connection with the proposed acquisition of Catalytica, Inc, by a third party ( DSM, a Dutch pharmaceutical company)  and the distribution of Catalytica's CCSI shares to Catalytica's stockholders immediately prior to that acquisition, we agreed to convert the Series B to CCSI common, agreed to vote for a 2 for 1 stock split, and negotiated a cashless exercise of the option after the effective date of the spin off. The effectiveness of these provisions is dependent upon the effectiveness of distribution and acquisition The option itself ( as amended by the Omnibus Agreement and otherwise ) expires January 14, 2001. The distribution is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2000, but is subject to a variety of conditions. After the distribution and concurrent closing of the Catalyica acquisition transaction, CCSI ( which formerly looked to its parent for financing and much of its administrative and other support) will be a stand- alone public company listed on NASDAQ, with the uncertainties attendant thereto. The Omnibus Agreement also contains provisions amending Sundance's registration rights, the board representation provisions in the original Stock Purchase Agreement, and certain transfer restrictions ( to liberalize them and allow the Raptor transaction to take place). There are also agreements related to Enron North America's Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement with GE and West LB, which do not directly affect the Series B Preferred. These provisions instead go to the development program for CCSI's technology, to which ENA contributes funding, and conform that agreement to a change in CCSI's and GE's strategy for commercializing the technology. The funding obligation itself is interconnected with the turbine purchases for ENA's Pastoria project in California, but I don't believe that transaction needs analysis for these purposes, To comply with SEC rules in connection with the distribution, CCSI has filed an S-1 registration statement registering the CCSI common stock to be distributed to Catalytica's shareholders with the SEC, and Catalytica, Inc. has filed a merger proxy statement with the SEC in connection with its solicitation of Catalytica stockholder approval to the acquisition transaction. Comments are expected from  the SEC in 4 to 6 weeks. Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this matter further, and I am instructed to request that you return the revised copy of the Raptor I Proposal Sheet to me and copy Mary Cook and Lisa Mellancamp thereon. The foregoing description may be more than you need for the summary, but it really is a very abbreviated snapshot of the transaction. All the documents related to the Preferred Stock and Option, including the executed Omnibus Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement, have been previously delivered to Sara Shackleton and Hope Vargas. 
It has come to my attention that questions have been raised in reviewing the Raptor I Derivative Proposal Sheets regarding the type of information that should be set forth in the category entitled ""ASSET DESCRIPTION"".  The Master Derivatives Agreement (""MDA"") requires that the Proposal Sheets describe the ""Assets"" with respect to which the derivative transaction is to be executed. For purposes of the MDA, ""Assets"" is defined as ""assets, including without limitation common stock, partnership interests, member interests. other ownership interests, and other financial and physical assets.""  Therefore, the description should include both the nature of the ""Asset"" (i.e. whether it is an equity interest, a loan, working interest, etc.) and a little bit about the company (the entity in which ENA holds the interest or has the loan or working interest). Any comments to the Proposal Sheets should be delivered ASAP to the ""Enron person completing this form"" (This is the 3rd line under the heading ""GENERAL"" on each of the Proposal Sheets) along with a request that a revised Proposal Sheet be returned to the lawyer providing comments with copies to both Mary Cook and Lisa Mellencamp. The pressure to complete these Raptor hedges remains high and therefore your immediate attention is greatly appreciated.  Many thanks. Stuart

See attached.  I advised Brian that we would await FINAL sheets prior to preparation of swaps so as to not redo them all as we had to do on the publics.  I will review the sheets today and provide comments on them as to swap preparation and request source data as we may need to figure out what some of these items are and how to write the swaps (for example, ""income participation certificates"").  For those that fit neatly into our template, I will get paralegal support on first drafts.  For the other items I will discuss with Sara how we will split them between us.

As to ENA swaps, upon discussion with Andrea and Ryan there will be no language included in the provision in respect of trying to define when something is or is not deemed reasonably withheld.  See below.  Sara is discussing the Avici swap with EBS.  I am going to prepare the ENA confirms on this basis. The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated Number of Shares specified in the notice (the ""Notice""), to which the party receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  For the avoidance of doubt, a Notice shall be sent from either party to the other party on the Termination Date. Enron North America Corp.

Mary, Per your e-mail, I would like to delete (ii) in the defininition of ""reasonably withheld"" as there is only one party that has a possibility to have a material unhedged position (ie. Enron). Thanks, Ryan The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated Number of Shares specified in the notice (the ""Notice""), to which the party receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  For purposes of this Confirmation, the parties agree that consent shall be deemed reasonably withheld (i) if the party receiving the Notice has a reasonable business purpose for maintaining the Transaction (excluding any business purpose relating specifically to the existing or anticipated value of the Transaction or any other Transaction subject to the Agreement) or (ii) if consenting to the Notice would result in a material unhedged exposure or liability for the party receiving the Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, a Notice shall be sent from either party to the other party on the Termination Date. 
Kristina, please forward as you deem necessary to EBS persons for final approval.  Thank you. Please see attached language concerning the Raptor swaps in respect of the Valuation Date mechanism and advise me as soon as possible of your approval or comments, if any.  We are trying to finalize all public swaps (save Active Power) today, so your timeliness will be GREATLY appreciated by me!  Mary

See attached for ideas to scrub with Ryan and Andrea. All publics are in draft awaiting the resolution of this issue, except Active Power.  There is a memo to be released today discussing the entire Active Power scenario which should help us figure out how to draft same per Mike Galvan.  Further, I have asked Galvan to double check the Carrizo warrant numbers that were provided because I am not sure they make sense based upon

You will provide Tana and I with the Canadian conversion language for the 
1.  I was not sure whose doc the referenced notice was, but I think the address should be Talon c/o LJM2@ Co-Investment, L.P.  rather than just to Talon. 2.  Vargas met with me last night.  I am printing out and copying proposal sheets and valuations and stock ownership (the latter of which they are making corrections to and resending this morning.  My asst. is coordinating a meeting with Stuart, Sara and myself this morning to coordinate further review actions and swap preparation. 3.  Based upon the latest voice from Sefton re note adjustment, I checked with A. Currey and she advised that nothing need be said in the swap re same as the structure docs will automatically cause payment via adjustment. 
See attached and provide me with your comments. 
Based upon discussions with Andrea Reed, the res of the swap will be the warrant itself, not the underlying stock.  The warrants are valued separately with a ""warrant model"" and carry a price of their own differentiated from, although affected by, the stock price.  I did not get into further detail on the specifics of the modeling.  The will provide us the number of warrants, the strike price as of August 3.  Otherwise they will work similarly to the stock based swap I think.  She said they do not plan to exercise them, but 
I.  I thought it would be helpful to put the following in writing for everyone based upon our conversations with Ron Astin. In making ownership determinations the following applies: 1.  Where warrants are also owned: warrants (exercisable within 60 days by ""Enron"") + stock owned ________________________________________________________________ warrants (exercisable within 60 days by ""Enron"") + stock issued and outstanding 2.  Where preferred shares are owned: If preferred class is public, it must be included. If preferred class is private, but convertible to common public, it must be included. If preferred class is private (and not convertible to common public), and we do not own 10% of any other class that is public, then it does not need to be included. 3.  Where the shares are owned via a joint arrangement of any type, please be sure that the share numbers that are being reviewed and to be provided to 
Sara advised that we are reconsidering the staffing of the multitude of structured finance transactions which include swaps.  In connection with such considerations, please see the last note on the attached email from Sefton. I will cover Raptor 3 for now.  Mary 
Raptor 3 is now on. It will be the same as Raptor 2. We're also now going to do Raptor 4, a radically different structure using RESCO warrants. More info to follow  on that. MARY COOK 08/29/2000 06:44 PM 
I will await your direction as new documents are distributed.  Mary 
This deal is in being restructured to use Resco warrants instead of Enron common stock. As a result, I suggest you hold off on reviewing the docs at this time. Thanks! MARY COOK 08/29/2000 03:09 PM 
Clarification:  Only the Master ISDA between Roadrunner and Bobcat. 
Carol St. Clair has forwarded to me the Raptor III documents.  I will review only the Master ISDA which I presume is similar to the prior drafts and is intended to work the same role in the structure.  Please advise if you need me to review any other aspect of the transaction which is all otherwise being drafted by VE.  Mary 
Sara advised you were working a project re McGarret/Hawaii125.  I will forward emails I got today related to same shortly.  There also seems to be a ""Tahiti"" deal which is tracked off of Hawaii.  I have captured the Raptor III docs which Carol forwarded from VE.  Raptor II is closed.  I guess III is another cookie cutter of I and II.  Do you want Sara or I to look over Raptor III?  Maybe Sara, you and I should convene to discuss how we will handle all

Please review this email from David Dupre on confirm desk.  He has been inquiring of me re credit lines the last few weeks.  The margin cash issues seem to be getting a bit of attention lately.  However, these are new brokerage agreements or amendments or amplifications of established accounts to trade other commodities.  I have the paperwork Refco sent.  Maybe we should sent down and visit re all of the brokerage matters.  Should I handle these, or stick with the ones related to margin lines.  Should we send this kind of stuff to Jason?  Please advise.  Mary 
Hi, 1. Refco Refco's paperwork will be submitted to you today to review. It is my understanding that the following rates have been negotiated (on a round-turn basis): $2.50 Brokerage $0.55 Exchange $1.20 Clearing $4.25 Our contact there is Steffen van Keppel at 713-266-0050 2. Cargill Our traders want to renew crude oil trading with Cargill at a lower rate. Which legal documents do we need to sign to ensure that this lower commission rate is established and honored? 3. GNI-Next advisors We are talking to Stephen Purdy upon the request of Spencer Vosko. We have been advised that the rate will be $5.25 on a roundturn basis. This broker will be forwarded their paperwork to the trader, and, I'll ensure that you receive it. Please keep me updated on any other new brokers which we may be negotiating with for new agreements and/or existing brokerage agreements which may be establishing a line of credit. Many thanks, David 3-3528 
Please check the attached list to confirm that these are all the lines we have of which you are aware.  Thanks Mary

I don't see anything in the file that indicates why the Master with CES was not terminated, only that it will be inactive. MARY COOK@ECT 08/22/2000 08:29 AM 
Stephanie,  double check.  It appears the CES master and transactions were assigned to ENA and the transactions assigned over to the ENA BOM Master Agreement that we already had we BOM.  For some reason the parties then agreed not to terminate the old CES master, but leave it in place inactive. Normally we would terminate the CES master when we have one in place. Stephanie, is there anything in the file indicating why it was not so terminated?  Did BOM want to keep it in place until the prior trans were expired for a belt and suspender?  Please advise.  Mary

I thought this might be helpful to you.  It is a short narrative on the off balance sheet funding vehicle done the first round.  It is this vehicle into which the KCS 2 deal will be placed.

I spoke with Jesus and Marshall re the 97/3 split.  B of A would have to decide if they want to go ahead at this early of a date to fix the 3% certificate portion on their end.  Jesus thinks it not probable that they would do so at this time, but rather lock in a few days before the VPP transaction.  B of A economics would be different.  However, it does seem that B of A should be consulted.

I got a call from Jason Williams on this file.  As it turns out, in his review of the annual report of Welch he noted that it stated that Welch is a cooperative.  The original draft of the ISDA was not drafted with this knowledge as there was no indication from any source that Welch was a cooperative.  This fact needs to be confirmed, and if Welch is a cooperative, you will need to research the issue.  I attach for you a letter of issues sent to outside counsel last year when we were investigating another proposed cooperative counterparty.  Hope this will help.

Attached is latest term sheet (marked to show changes to 11/18 draft); clean version is attached to e-mail below to Jim Lawler of Wilmington Trust.   Note that we had an extensive call with NatWest on Wednesday and are considering some of their issues for next draft of term sheet.  We will keep you posted. Note also that new entities signed off upon by accounting, legal and tax for financing transaction are Delaware business trust for bank investments, Texas limited partnership for VPP investments, and [Delaware or Texas] limited liability company owned by ENA (or affiliate) to be managing partner of limited partnership.

Jim, thanks for being so responsive.  Attached please find the latest draft of term sheet for the Joshua Tree transaction.  We continue to negotiate with the banks but want to get this to you so you can get up to speed on transaction structure.  Basically, banks would invest in certificates of a Delaware business trust of which Wilmington would be trustee.  The trust in turn would be the limited partner in a Texas limited partnership.  The managing partner of the limited partnership would be Enron North America Corp. or another Enron subsidiary.  The limited partnership would invest in volumetric production payments.   Note that names given in term sheet for new entities may change. Tim Proffitt is the Enron commercial lead on this transaction.  John Rain of Thompson & Knight (Dallas) is our outside counsel.  Robin Miles of Bracewell & Patterson (Houston) is representing Bank of America.  Thompson & Knight is doing initial draft of trust agreement (starting with Margaux form). Let us know particulars of your team and counsel (names, firms, office and home contact info) and we will add them to the working group list and distribute.  The goal is to have this transaction closed by December 15, 2000. Thanks again and let me know as you need additional information. Regards, NJD Nora J.

Maricela has requested a copy of the termination notice for the referenced swap.  I advised her that you would have done the document in relation to the swap (of which I think there was only one).  I cannot remember if it was ever terminated.  Can you coordinate this matter with Maricela.  I am covering the rest of the Raptor requests.

You had done the master and it appears restricted.  Could you look at this one?  Karolina Moran is preparing a credit worksheet to forward to us. Thanks. Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) mary.cook@enron.com 
Karolina in my group will contact Mark.  Karolina investigated the transaction and transacting entity to ensure that no CredReserve was required.  She will also ensure the documentation is acceptable. Typically, on deals such as this (financing related) the lender will dictate the terms - to avoid subordination or early termination events. Rod 
Good Afternoon Rod, I wanted to follow up with you regarding Credit Approval for the Interest Rate Swap that Aaron Armstrong negotiated on 5/1/01. I spoke with Mary Cook, Legal in Houston, and she stated that she requires a Credit Approval Term Sheet from you. She said she would be happy to prepare the Master ISDA Agreement for us. In the event you haven't received the terms of the Interest Rate Swap from Aaron, here they are:.

Sara/Mary - I'm not sure which of you to direct this question to, so I'll ask you both and either can run with it....... I am attaching a confirmation for the paper product OCC#11.  The desk came back to me with modifications to incorporate that change this into a type of confirmation I have never done before.  So I need some help: - This will be an American Call Swaption.  The Buyer has the option to settle physically or financially into a call. - For financial settlement: Exercise periods:  May 1 - May31 to exercise the June period June 1 - June 30 to exercise the July period July 1 - July 31 to exercise to August period (close of business 4:30 EST) - For physical settlment: Exercise periods are the same as for financial settlement - If they exercise physically, the Seller must be allowed at least 30 days to deliver 2000 short tons per month for each Determination Period at the defined Location. - The language they gave me for the Floating Price is: The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be based off the arithmetic average fo the bid/offer price based off www.clickpaper.com at the time of exercising the call option (US Physical OCC#11 FAS Port Elizabeth Harbor, Spot month) I'm attaching a copy of the original confirmation I generated , using just the info that was on the ticket. (clearly the ticket was lacking a lot of important things, and incorrect on others)....you can use it to incorporate the necessary changes if you'd like, or start from scratch. Let me know what other info you might need and I'll try to get it from either the desk or from the physcial confirms group. Thanks a lot, Diane

To all, AEP has recently stopped signing our Financial Confirmations due to the fact that the ISDA Master shows that they are the confirming party.  We have never signed their confirmations, nor do they even send confirmations currently. AEP has indicated that they would be willing to amend the Master for the confirming party to be Enron.  Can one of you please start this ball rolling? Thanks, Joe

Samantha will not be returning for an additional and yet undetermined number of weeks.  In light of this, I reviewed the matters remaining in her office and have distributed them to a number of you for further review and handling in accordance with assigned files and areas.  If you have any questions about any of those matters, please stop by.  Further, with respect to other files for which Samantha remains the assigned paralegal pursuant to the trading data base, any attorney needing paralegal support during the course of work on the file should please see me to coordinate reassignments to other paralegals.  Thank you all. Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
I anticipate that Samantha will be out of the office for a time.  In order that Samantha's work in progress be covered in her absence, please take the following steps.  The attorneys should retrieve from her desk and files those current file matters for which they are responsible.  To the extent you and your administrative assistant can cover the file matters, please do so in order to maintain a reasonable workload for the other paralegals.  If some of your file matters need further paralegal assistance, please advise me so that reassignments to other paralegals can be coordinated based upon the workloads of Susan, Stephanie, and Tana.  Thank you. Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax)

Attached below for your review is a proposed short form master agreement for Canadian use on the basis of our prior conversations.  The form is now available for your use under appropriate circumstances.  Use of the form will require credit approval and credit worksheet preparation submitted to Houston legal for preparation, similar to the ISDA procedures for credit review, drafting, and negotiation.  Please inform your working groups of the foregoing.  Susan Bailey will be including this form in our current form bank.

1.  Carol St Clair will be handling whatever is finally decided to be done with the Raptor 2 South American swaps (assignment or termination).  Please coordinate with her.  Carol, attached below is our general form of notice of termination which has to be customized depending upon the type of investment etc.  Sara had done the original South American swaps of which I do not have copies. 2.  Depending on the timing of the Mariner transaction, Angela Davis or I will assist.  I will be out of the office March 17 to 25.  If the swap needs to be written in my absence, please contact Angela Davis.

It looks like that we will be proceeding with putting Mariner into Raptor. Please start preparing the preliminary information. Thanks, Gordon Gordon McKillop 02/28/2001 04:52 PM 
There is a possibility that Mariner will be going into Raptor.  In preparation for that, I am proposing that we start the Raptor process for Mariner by preliminarily completing the Raptor proposal sheet and the Raptor legal checklist response form.  Attached is an update from the Raptor process that was developed by Mary Cook after Raptor I swaps were done.  Please contact me if you have any questions or comments on the process. Thanks, Gordon 
Jeff, thanks for your work on Bob's draft, however, for form management purposes we are going to continue with our previous style which is to include the crossborder annexes. 1.  Attached below is the ENA/US Annex A, which is the base GTC type of document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ENA contracts with a Canadian party we use the Canadian Annex attachment (also attached below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ENA contracts with a foreign counterparty other than Canada, the Canadian Annex may be utilized with additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US. 2.  Attached below is the ECC/Canadian Annex A, which is the base GTC type of document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ECC contracts with a US party we use the United States Annex attachment (also attached below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ECC contracts with a foreign counterparty other than US, the United States Annex may be utilized with additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US. At your convenience, please review the Canadian and United States annexes and advise of any comments.  Thanks again. Note to Paralegals:  Please note that the annexes are now under current forms.  If you have any questions about how they are to be utilized, please stop by to discuss.

Ladies, Could one of you please tell me what is Legal's position on generating confirms for EOL trades?  I was under the impression (evidently false) that we did NOT send confirms for gas  deals done on EOL.  I did hear that legal was currently reviewing this issue.  Do you know where it stands, or who the best person to contact about this would be?  Please let me know. We are looking to do some confirm automation (at last, at last!) and one of the issues we are looking at is do we REALLY need to send paper confirms for trades done on EOL.  It seems that it would just give someone one more chance to dispute the trade. Mary, I was at the DCAF conference where you spoke on the issue of electronic confirmtions and on line trading, but I don't remember how far Enron was on these issues. Sara,  It seems like we talked about this as part of a larger conversation on web-based confirms. I would be grateful to hear both of your thoughts/concerns related to the above. Thanks very much for your help! 
1.  We should not terminate.  Sara will call Joel to discuss. 2. If the Raptor process documentation I prepared several months ago (and to which we all agreed) is being altered, it would be appreciated if the swap attorneys and Lisa Mellencamp could be a part of discussing changes, and minimally, be advised of any changes. Thank you.

No.  I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the correct parties etc.  Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of inapplicable specifics) .    We ought to also check with Joel about any provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment. I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be clean from the ISDA point of view.

You would not need to amend the ISDA.  Payment Dates are stated in the confirmations.  Regarding your item 4, you might wish to talk to Sara concerning the history of the payment date as 5th after determinable.  The issue has been discussed often over the years between settlements and treasury.

QG7130.1, NY2665.1 and NY5271.1 Premstar Energy Canada has requested that the Payment Dates for the above noted financial transactions be amended to conform with physical settlement from ""The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable"" to ""The twenty fifth (25th) day of the month following each Determination Period.  Should the Payment Date fall on a weekend or statutory holiday, payment shall be made on the next Business Day."". My comments are as follows: 1. Russell, kindly confirm that there is no credit concern with extending the financial payment cycle; 2. Laura/Cheryl, kindly confirm that it is something that we have done in the past for financial transactions; 3. Melinda, assuming that Russell, Laura/Cheryl do not have concerns, please prepare an amendment to each of the Confirmation Letters as requested by Premstar, except that the final sentence of their requested amendment should read:  ""Should the Payment Date fall on a Saturday or statutory holiday other than a Monday, then payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, and if the Payment Date is a Sunday or statutory holiday falling on a Monday, then payment shall be made on the immediately following Business Day."".  This will make the Payment Dates consistent with physical gas settlement. 4. Melinda, if this amendment is not approved by Russell, Laura or Cheryl, I think that an amendment is nonetheless necessary to the Payment Date, as it is not the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable, but rather the fifth (5th) Business Day of the month following each Determination Period. 5. If possible, Premstar would like the amendment to be effective for the February, 2001 Determination Period. 6. Premstar would also like this provision to extend to any and all future Financial Swap transactions done with them.  Mary, is there any amendment required to the ISDA to effect such a permanent amendment, or is this a matter that can be dealt with in each subsequent confirmation letter? Regards, Peter

Per discussion with Lance this morning, the ""underwriting"" aspects of the EITF swaps are in the nature of a cash make-whole; therefore, I wonder if it is an appropriate concept for EITF equity classification.  I am not going to put it into the Talon swap. Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
FYI.  How all of this may work with respect to the swaps in these structures (which I believe to have been signed, but still have not been provided executed copies) is unclear.

FYI. Mark -- lets give some thought to how this effects both structure and the ability to give the FAS 125 opinions on the sale of the notes on Raptor 3.

Joe Hunter has requested that in the future he be provided copies of all confirmations in respect of any structured finance transactions in which we participate.  To the extent we cannot quickly get executed versions, he would like to receive the final draft versions.  I will discuss coordinating this with Global Finance Legal during our Raptor process meeting next week. Enron North America Corp.

A.  You will be sent: 1.  Drafts of the Yosemite 3 confirmations (Gina Karathonos (Global Fiannce paralegal) will follow up with executed versions when we receive them from Milbank Tweed). 2.  Copies of the executed swaps that were done in connection with Raptor 1. B.  Attached below are the final drafts of 3 swaps that were done in connection with Raptor 3. Brenda Funk will provide you with copies of the executed versions of these swaps as soon as possible. C.  Sara is working on Raptor 2 swaps.

The Raptor process meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, October 24, 2000 at 10:00 a.m. in EB38C1. 
Sara Shackleton and I are the primary swap team assigned to the preparation of swaps to be placed into the Raptor structures.  We have previously worked with Sefton and Chin in coordinating the processes involved.  Having completed Raptor 1 swaps, and some of the Raptor 2 and 3 swaps, I discussed with Sefton what I considered to be an improvement to the processes and work allocation between the various groups involved.  We were to have a meeting with the various people involved last week, but given the changes in staff in your group and Andrea Reed's move, I thought it best to wait a week.  My assistant, Chaundra Woods, will be coordinating the meeting.  I would request that either you, or another attorney who will assist in the future, or both, attend.  We have retained Julia Chin on the working group list, but she did not originally work on Raptor. Thanks.  Mary Enron North America Corp.

Regarding the H1250 swaps that are to be written today, please note that the swap group will not be reviewing the underlying asset for confidentiality or securities issues etc.  It was my understanding that the swap will be struck after TNPC goes public, but at what juncture of Enron's ownership may be hard to tell.  In any event, I presume your group is analyzing all these matters with Ron Astin.  Mary Enron North America Corp.

I am currently working on a new ISDA wherein the counterparty is a US sub of a foreign Guarantor.  Upon consulting with Rhett Jackson in Tax, he thought we needed to work a form of the tax reps into the guaranty since the Guarantor was foreign.  I see the same issue arising in respect of certain other amendments on which I am working.  Rhett is looking over this matter now and I will advise.    Any thoughts? Enron North America Corp.

Thanks for your additional comments.  Attached are all the revised forms to put into your system.  The major concept addition is a partial termination right in the partnership and membership forms in the same format as the share swap form.

Pursuant to the request to have the partneship and membership interests be partially terminable as the other investments, attached are revised swaps reflecting such rights in the same manner as reflected in the other equity swaps.

Scott has advised that he and Julia Chin cannot attend the Raptor processes meeting, and at his request we will cancel and reschedule.

Attached are the swap forms we have utilized in round one of the raptor off balance sheet swap project.  I have tried to clean them, and have also incorporated comments received thus far from Kirkland & Ellis, firm for Talon.  Please review these forms and provide any further comments or suggestions to them by Tuesday morning of next week.   As I mentioned, we plan to forward to you proposal sheets as and when received for all the remaining swaps to be placed into the raptor vehicles for preparation of the swaps by your firm.  We should know more about the timing of the next round of swaps next week.  As other and varied investments may be placed in the vehicles, we will ask that your firm develop the forms to be used on the basis of the proposals and any documents applicable to the underlying investment.  Finally, please finalize the memorandum on termination and forward to my attention next week, if possible. Thank you for your continued assistance.  Please confirm receipt and ability to have comments to me by Tuesday. Mary Enron North America Corp.

I have left you each a voice mail, but wanted to be sure to try to catch the issue with you by email as well. We received a fax today at 3 with some comments from K&E on the swaps.  Please note that we have processed most all of the swaps and are now working on Merlin and Catalytica which are more complex.  Julia Chin and I have reviewed the comments and feel that they are not substantive and only reflect different wording styles.  At this juncture we would request that you assess whether or not our time is well spent reprocessing all of the swaps on the basis of the K&E comments.  Please consider these matters as soon as you can obtain a copy of their mark-ups and advise me.  In order that I be most productive I intend to continue my work on the Merlin Credit Derivative while awaiting your direction on these other nonsubstantive changes.  Therefore, the subject swaps will not now be reprocessed.  Thank you.  Mary Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
The attached swaps will be delivered by hard copy batch, together with the revised proposal sheets and a copy of the legal worksheets, to Gordon McKillop, in Julia Chin's absence, today.  Upon receipt, Gordon will attach the valuation data that has been previously provided to Julia Chin by Hope Vargas and coordinate execution. First, additional publics representing the incremental interests of Chewco, then followed by numerous privates.  As of now, we still are working Catalytica and Merlin. Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
For those of you involved in any Raptor equity investments out of JEDI I, I have been advised by Andrea Reed that Chewco Investments purchased a position in JEDI I.  Chewco is owned in part by an Enron entity.  The result is that Enron entities now have a 96.12% interest in JEDI I (60% ENA + 36.12% EGF based upon Chewco).  I hope this is helpful in your review of the Raptor matters.  The closing binders are in the file room for you to review if you need to verify the materials.   Thank you.  Mary Enron North America Corp. Mary Cook 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) 
Attached is a revised proposal sheet and swap confirmation for the captioned underlying partnership interest.  The notional value has been changed in both, and EGF has been added as a business unit to the proposal.  The prior valuation did not include the SLP/Chewco interest that is covered by the swap.

Mary, The short answer to your questions about letters of credit is that if the creditor drew on the letter of credit for a margin payment or settlement payment under a forward contract or swap, it would be excluded from the trustee's power to avoid preferences.  (Bankruptcy Code section 546(e).) It does not matter if the payment is from the issuing bank or the counterparty since the Bankruptcy Code protects such payments made ""by or to"" a commodity broker or forward contract merchant.  The pending legislation would clarify this by expanding the definitions of ""commodity contract,"" ""forward contract,"" and ""swap agreement"" to specifically include ""credit enhancements"" related to the contract. The Powerline case never really bothered me and I'm curious to know why it bothers the panelists at the seminar you attended.  The creditor's problem in that case is that the letter of credit expired before the preference claim was commenced.  The fix is to negotiate a letter of credit termination date that is either (a) 91 days after the maturity date of the contract or (b) a day or more after the two-year limitations period for bringing preference actions, and in either case make it payable in the event a preference claim is brought and let the bank defend it. Banks are willing to do it because they collect fees for an indefinitely longer period (which makes settling the claim much easier) and borrowers are willing to do it because, generally, they have to. The Air Conditioning case is more troublesome and seems to have been wrongly decided except that there's a quirk in the facts that may justify the result.  On a quick read, the decision seems to violate the independence principle of letters of credit -- that is, that the beneficiary's right to draw on the letter of credit is independent from the issuing bank's exposure to the account debtor.  Applying the principle means that even if a pledge of collateral from the account debtor to the issuing bank is a preference, that's a matter between the bank and the debtor and does not interfere with the beneficiary's right to draw on the letter of credit. For the same reason, it should not matter, as the Court there seemed to focus on, that the creditor improved its position by securing its unsecured claim with a secured letter of credit.  That was precisely the issue in the infamous Twistcap decision that has been so roundly criticized, even by the judge who rendered it. The Eleventh Circuit in Air Conditioning seems at first to give no regard to the independence principle when it says that the creditor received a preference by virtue of the debtor's pledge of a certificate of deposit to the issuing bank. In and of itself, that reasoning is, in my view, wrong. However, later in the decision the Court seems to say that the proceeds of the creditor's draw on the letter of credit was, in fact, the very certificate of deposit pledged by the debtor to the bank. (The decision is somewhat confusing in that earlier in the opinion it says that the bankruptcy court ordered the bank to return the certificate of deposit to the bankruptcy trustee.) If the creditor held the certificate of deposit, two consequences flow from that fact:  First, it means that while proceeds of letters of credit generally are not property of the debtor's bankruptcy estate, in this case, since the certificate of deposit was merely pledged as collateral to the bank, it was indisputably property of the estate.  The fact that it was conveyed to a third party doesn't change that. Second, if the pledge to the bank was a preference (and no party argued that it wasn't) then recovering the transferred property from the creditor is the right result, although here too I think the Court's reasoning misses the mark. The Court relied on the provision of the avoidance recovery statute (section 550) that  allows recovery of preferential transfers from the initial transferee or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made. I believe the certificate of deposit was transferred for the bank's reimbursement claim and therefore for its benefit and not the creditor's. To the extent it is deemed to have been made for the beneficiary's benefit, it again ignores the independence principle.  But the same result could have been reached had the Court instead relied on the part of section 550 that allows recovery from the initial transferee or any immediate transferee from such initial transferee.  Since the creditor received the certificate of deposit, it was the immediate transferee from the initial transferee bank. Of course the fix in this case is to have a letter of credit that provides for more fungible proceeds, such as cash, and have it come from the bank's own funds. I hope these comments are helpful.  Please call if you have any questions or wish to discuss these issues. Regards. ______________ Rick B.

I am currently working on a new ISDA wherein the counterparty is a US sub of a foreign Guarantor.  Upon consulting with Rhett Jackson in Tax, he thought we needed to work a form of the tax reps into the guaranty since the Guarantor was foreign.  I see the same issue arising in respect of certain other amendments on which I am working.  Rhett is looking over this matter now and I will advise.    Any thoughts? Enron North America Corp.

I have since spoken with John Arnold and Joe Deffner regarding the matter. Per John:  He sees some value in utilizing MG in the nature of broker fees reduction; however, his general estimate is only 2MM a year savings. However, he sees the value in the margin credit lines we now have and are continuing to increase.  I spoke with him briefly regarding the legal issues which I think he appreciated as significant. Per Joe:  He also sees a limited economic advantage in respect of the broker fees.  However, he thinks the interest free margin lines provide us with greater value, in part due to increased liquidity and the insulation from funds flow volatility.  Joe thinks margin lines should be utilized first and then outside brokers.  He sees MG pretty much as any other outside broker. If you have any questions, call. Enron North America Corp.

I am confused.  Perhaps we can all get on a call and talk to determine how we can best coordinate the various matters.  My experience is that often the confirm and annex issues relate and need to be coordinated together if the counterparty has comments.  Per your note I will continue to do the Powerex deal for now.

No, I do not think so.  I think we might have a misunderstanding on the separation of roles between ECC and ENA.  ECC legal will do the legal work in assisting the Calgary confirm desk in preparing the actual confirms, amendments, terminations, etc.  However, ENA legal will continue to handle all legal matters or inquiries with respect to the negotiation and interpretation of the contracts surrounding the confirms which, I assume, would include the negotiation and interpretation of matters such as the financial GTC forms.  Therefore, I would suspect that the negotiation of the terms of the GTC between ECC and PowerEX, for example, would still be handled by ENA.  Also, as a result, I would suspect that the guarantees would also be coordinated with Clement through ENA.  Perhaps Mark Taylor can clarify on these points. Cheers Greg MARY COOK 11/10/2000 10:40 AM

Attached is latest term sheet (marked to show changes to 11/18 draft); clean version is attached to e-mail below to Jim Lawler of Wilmington Trust.   Note that we had an extensive call with NatWest on Wednesday and are considering some of their issues for next draft of term sheet.  We will keep you posted. Note also that new entities signed off upon by accounting, legal and tax for financing transaction are Delaware business trust for bank investments, Texas limited partnership for VPP investments, and [Delaware or Texas] limited liability company owned by ENA (or affiliate) to be managing partner of limited partnership.

Jim, thanks for being so responsive.  Attached please find the latest draft of term sheet for the Joshua Tree transaction.  We continue to negotiate with the banks but want to get this to you so you can get up to speed on transaction structure.  Basically, banks would invest in certificates of a Delaware business trust of which Wilmington would be trustee.  The trust in turn would be the limited partner in a Texas limited partnership.  The managing partner of the limited partnership would be Enron North America Corp. or another Enron subsidiary.  The limited partnership would invest in volumetric production payments.   Note that names given in term sheet for new entities may change. Tim Proffitt is the Enron commercial lead on this transaction.  John Rain of Thompson & Knight (Dallas) is our outside counsel.  Robin Miles of Bracewell & Patterson (Houston) is representing Bank of America.  Thompson & Knight is doing initial draft of trust agreement (starting with Margaux form). Let us know particulars of your team and counsel (names, firms, office and home contact info) and we will add them to the working group list and distribute.  The goal is to have this transaction closed by December 15, 2000. Thanks again and let me know as you need additional information. Regards, NJD Nora J.

Attached is a redraft of the three proposed points for inclusion in each of financial and physical power confirms.  Please review and advise of any further comments or thoughts. It is my understanding that it has been decided that Canada wants to negate Market Disruption concepts on the basis of changes to EUA or Pool rules.  I have also negated force majeure claims on the same basis (typically not apt in financial--however, since it could be argued I added it in the financial confirm language as well).  Question:  Would we also want to add ""any other excuse of performance"" to this concept?  Such language would afford a broader sweep in respect of various claims, however, (i) the sweep may be too broad in light of it covering any change in the EUA or Pool rules and (ii) ultimately, we may want some flexibility to argue other points.   Advise. Under Performance Suspension the intent is to carve out the ""trade"" for suspension, while leaving the other aspects of the masters/gtcs in place, such as bankruptcy and other termination events.

ENA is proceeding with a number of volumetric production payment transactions.  Generally, the producer will want to establish the pricing through a swap mechanism prior to the actual closing of the VPP and prior to the syndication of the VPP.   For example, Preston Exploration entered into a swap last Friday with ENA to establish the VPP pricing on a transaction to be closed this week.  At the VPP closing the Preston position in the swap will be transferred to ECT Merchant Investments Corp. (a wholly owned sub of ENA and VPP buyer); therefore, the swap counterparties will then be ECTMI and ENA.  As the VPP is syndicated (planned prior to year end), the original Preston swap position will be further assigned/restated to the syndicate VPP buyer (generally a Texas LP 99.9999% owed by an unrelated Trust).  Upon the last transfer, the swap will not be between two Enron subs. Based upon viewing other VPP structures, it is my understanding that these swaps do not need the RMT  tax treatment since the swap is carried as an affiliate swap only as an interim step.  Please advise.  I will be preparing the swaps on the basis of the foregoing absent your direction otherwise. As noted in my voice mail, I also need to visit with you about RMT in general.  Thanks.

In looking the captioned doc over, I noted the fees involved are based solely on MMBTUs.  Since Canada is now engaging in power transactions (and already using some ENA ISDAs), should this agreement's fee schedule be amended to reflect a power price too?  If you agree, I will coordinate.

See the attached regarding our discussions of yesterday with respect to the ISDA contracts.  Generally, transfers of financial transactions will require 
Another ""unusual"" thought (subject to usual MG concerns):  Could we move the NYMEX trades out of ENA's name and have the MG entity ""own"" the trades for itself as a clearing member thereby allowing MG to post 50% LCs on its own trades?  MG would not be acting as our clearing broker but for their own account.   Of course, we would have to verify that this would work and consider regulatory oversight issues.

Craig: Hope you had a Happy New Year. Marcus is out this week. I have not been in the loop recently regarding the clearing issues. I know that Mary Cook of our Legal Department here in Houston had looked into the issues with some of the Operations people working under John Lavaroto. I do not know what the conclusions, if any, were as a result of that work. I think Limor Nissan, our new Senior Counsel in NY, should now be involved in this, and should coordinate with Mary once Limor gets a read from you on where you are going with this.  Also, I got a voice mail from Paul Pantano of McDermott, Will & Emery today, and he indicated that you would like him to do some work. Craig, in order for us to effectively manage legal issues, Limor needs to be involved in all requests made for outside legal work. Please coordinate with her. Let me know if you need any further assistance. Thanks. Regards, Alan Craig Young 01/03/2001 03:10 PM

Brenda, for future transactions wherein swaps are involved, please see that extra copies of executed swaps are made at closing so that copies may be immediately distributed to the applicable confirmation desks.  Since this aspect of the structured finance transactions include ""trading"" transactions, the confirmation desks need the paperwork immediately for their reference and audit trails and to avoid confusion with deal tickets etc.  Please forward this memo to the other paralegals and attorneys in your group.  For your reference, at this time the distribution of executed copies should be provided as follows depending upon the nature of the swaps: Laurel Adams:  Interest Rate Swaps Larry Joe Hunter and Bob Bowen:  Gas Commodity Swaps Derek Bailey:  Crude Oil Swaps Melissa Murphy:  Power Swaps Dianne Seib:  Canada Swaps Swap Trading Attorney:  as applicable to the attorney who assisted Cordially, Mary Cook Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith, 38th Floor, Legal Houston, Texas   77002-7361 (713) 345-7732 (phone) (713) 646-3490 (fax) mary.cook@enron.com Brenda L Funk 01/16/2001 07:58 AM 
Mary, We do not yet have execution copies of the documents.  I am expecting them this week.  I will send copies of the swaps as soon as I receive them. Thanks, Brenda Funk (713) 853-6950 (713) 853-9252 (fax) Mary Cook 01/11/2001 01:43 PM 
As to the initial closing into the Brazos partnership of Preston 1 and Crescendo, legal drafted the interest rate swaps. Brenda, may Laurel and I get executed copies of the interest rate swaps, and I need the rest of the swap docs too, as well as copies to Larry Joe Hunter, all as previously requested.  Mary Laurel, I do not have executed versions.  I did draft the swaps and they were signed at closing, but Global Finance Legal is in charge of distribution of executed docs.  To the extent it is helpful here are the final versions that I sent to closing.  If I can be of further help, please call.

Mary, It was my understanding (from Tim Proffitt) that the legal department drafted all of the documents related to Brazos.  Does this include the interest rate swaps?  Originally you had sent me to Brenda Funk to get copies of the confirms for my records, but I have not heard anything from her at all. Could you please forward to me a copy of the documents, even if it has only been signed off on by one party?  I would like to review them and send them on to our file room. IF LEGAL HAS NOT DRAFTED THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONFIRMS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW RIGHT AWAY, SO THAT I CAN PREPARE THESE DOCUMENTS!! Thank you.

I find it useful to be able to use search and find for concepts etc. in negotiating and understanding the guide and definitions.

Carol, attached is the Canadian industrial on which I have worked, both clean and redlined from the US industrial (the redlined annexes are somewhat laborious).  Please note in the area of transaction formation that Canada desired confirmation with and without phone (wherein confirmation is prepared and signed with counterparty ""at the table"" so to speak).  Please review and provide me your comments.  Thanks for your help. Mark, in terms of processes, should I distribute this to anyone else for review and comment?

Attached below for your review is a proposed short form master agreement for Canadian use on the basis of our prior conversations.  The form is now available for your use under appropriate circumstances.  Use of the form will require credit approval and credit worksheet preparation submitted to Houston legal for preparation, similar to the ISDA procedures for credit review, drafting, and negotiation.  Please inform your working groups of the foregoing.  Susan Bailey will be including this form in our current form bank.

It has come to my attention that with respect to ISDA masters we file as follows: 1.  Original documents for ISDA and any ongoing legal activity, such as assignments etc., are directed to Global Contracts. 2.  A Blue file with copies of item 1 is retained in our files. 3.  A hardback green file is then made (a copy of Blue file) and sent to Kay Young to be maintained in legal files. Items 2 and 3 are duplicative copies and require duplicative ongoing upkeep with respect to assignments, mergers, name changes etc.  Panus, Jones and I are to discuss this soon.  I think we should cease doing item 3 as it is duplicative and ""making work.""  I might also suggest that all prior green files on ISDAs in the file room be destroyed.  It may have served a purpose at one time, but I cannot see it now.  I will discuss this with Tana before making a decision.   What are your thoughts/approval?  Thanks.

I anticipate that Samantha will be out of the office for a time.  In order that Samantha's work in progress be covered in her absence, please take the following steps.  The attorneys should retrieve from her desk and files those current file matters for which they are responsible.  To the extent you and your administrative assistant can cover the file matters, please do so in order to maintain a reasonable workload for the other paralegals.  If some of your file matters need further paralegal assistance, please advise me so that reassignments to other paralegals can be coordinated based upon the workloads of Susan, Stephanie, and Tana.

It has come to my attention that a copy of each ECC Isda we finalize should be forwarded to you for your records.  I am not sure that this has been consistently accomplished since I was unaware.  In order to verify that you have all copies, could you send me a listing of all of your Isda ECC files on hand.  I will have it compared to our database and we will copy for you those that you may not have.  Proceeding forward, we will copy you as and when completed.  Thank you. Paralegals:  This memo should serve as notice to all paralegals that upon finalizing any ECC Isda file a copy of the blue file should be forwarded to Greg in Calgary.

Jordan Mintz has requested that his global finance group be provided with a lunch time seminar on the basics of swapping.
