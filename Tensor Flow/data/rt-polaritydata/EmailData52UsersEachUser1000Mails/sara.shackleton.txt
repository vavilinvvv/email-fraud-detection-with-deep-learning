Larry Anderson with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an Enron Corp. guaranty.  From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that Enron Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, Enron Corp. provided Carr with a ""comfort letter"" reciting the corporate ""policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly.""  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr. Joe, I believe that Larry may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to ""Other Agreements"".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the entry in  the master swap agreement database.

You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the inclusion of ""Other Agreements"" in the ""All Agreements"" section as the system is currently designed. I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago. The system is confusing.

It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the ""Other Agreements"" section, to house these other agreements.  My understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously. The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement is a very bad idea. Sara Shackleton 03/14/01 05:35 PM

Do we have an outside counsel memorandum, or will we have an internal one soon, that we can send to Martin (as well as the other non-US swap lawyers)? 
can you help Martin w this thanks 
Elisabeth: I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications? Martin 
Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem. In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume. Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations. Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian counterparties. Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.

Her fax number is 713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as above. Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me know. Greg 
ENA  sent execution copies of the ISDA to Kellogg Company on April 10.  By copy of this email, I ask that you touch base with Tana Jones in Houston who will verify the status of ENA's ISDA with Kellogg Company and send you copies of our documents for use in your negotiations.  Let  me know if you have any questions.  Sara Deepak Sitlani 05/02/2000 06:55 AM 
Sara Paul Radous asked me to get in touch with you in connection with a proposed ISDA Master Agreement with Kellog Supply Services (Europe) Limited.  I should be grateful if you would send me by e-mail all documents relating to the ISDA recently executed between ENA and Kellog's as Paul would like us to use similar provisions. In passing, I should point out that both I and my colleague, Michael Khajeh-Noori, will be dealing with this matter.  I am in the office on Mondays and Tuesdays and Michael is in the office on Thursdays and Fridays. I should therefore be grateful if you would address any e-mails to both of us (we can both be contacted on the same extension: 34539). If you have any questions, please let me know. With kind regards Deepak Paul: will you be preparing a credit worksheet for this entity? 
FYI 
Paul We have recently concluded an ISDA with The Kellogg  Company in the USA. Now their European entity, Kellogg Supply Services (Europe) Limited of The Kellogg Building, Talbot Road, Manchester M19 0PU, UK, would like to see an ISDA Mastera and Schedule. Can you look at this entity from a credit point of view please? I do not have separate financials for them, but if you need them will ask for a latest set. Thanks Martin Holmes PS Did you get the Sappi International financials? And have you made any progress with Rottneros? Thanks MH London x 5357

Also, I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a ""General Guarantee Agreememt"" on behalf of Enron North America Corp. (formerly, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) on January 28, 1998.

I got a copy of 2000 Definitions Annex via distribution today.  However, I did not know of nor do I have the 2000 Definitions, which apparently restated/conformed the 1991/1998 basic ISDA definitions.  Our Master still refs 1991, as amended etc., so it probably does pick up the 2000 issuance by ISDA.  Do you have the 2000?  Do we need to order?  Should we consider revising the master agreement in respect of the definition incorporation

Morgan Stanley Tana, Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is working on this. I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all questions to Mark. Could you let me know if you have any info? Thx, Tracyh

Anyone know anything about this? 
Everybody, Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the status of the master. Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling this and pass the info on. 
I will need to be at my home today and tomorrow at 4 pm for repair 
The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm. If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  Sara Tana Jones 08/07/2000 10:52 AM 
I thought this was what we were already doing.  Sara, Mark, wasn't that your understanding? Brent Hendry@ENRON 08/07/2000 10:45 AM 
When the Master does not have the weather modification to the Trade Option Exemption representation then I think we should include it in the confirm. Is this feasible? Tana Jones@ECT 08/07/2000 10:25 AM 
Tanya forwarded the attached confirm on to me.  Are we supposed to have that weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master?

I keep trying to pick a good day to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want. How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing? I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are having fun.

North America Corp. 
North America Corp. Hi Sara-- There are open issues regarding the L/C faciltity, so Carol and I decided not to comment on specific clauses until those issues were resolved.  I believe Carol was ok with Section 18, but it was added shortly before she left for maternity leave.  Because we are still trading with you under the existing BT ISDA, the clause is simply meant to sweep-in any exisiting BT-Enron trades under the new DB-Enron facility. Please let me know if you have any further questions.  My understanding is that we are now scheduled to talk on Wed. at 11am NY time. I look forward to talking with you then.

I did not see your response. (2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see your response. (3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that DB acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have both parties agreed as to existing transactions? Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara

I believe the confirm was created in Legal.   Is it possible for me to get a copy of this confirmation?  We are having a real problem getting this settlement booked each month, so we want to refer to confirm to see what is said.  I am out next week, but could you ask someone to send a copy to Todd 
ENA and ECTRIC have masters with this counterparty. I NEED THESE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREPAY ORIGINATING FROM LONDON WHICH CLOSES TOMORROW. These are both missing from the files. Does anyone have these?  Please contact me ASAP! 
Tana: Richard Sage, CFO for EnronCredit.com, would like a link to be able to access 
Please note regarding ""finance deals, prepays"". 
Please keep Bill and I in the loop.  Thanks. 
Tanya: This year is no different from any other year and we are always asked to review the swap component of the Global Finance structured deals.  We are also seeing lots of prepays. Who is the credit person to be apprised of these transactions?  Should we immediately involve you and Bill? At the moment, Mary Cook, Angela Davis (legal finance group) and I are juggling the deals. Please let me know and I'll alert the swap group.  Thanks.  Sara 
I would like to add Dec. 7 as a vacation day.  Please let me know if there 
Please let me know who handles this one.  Our power trader is Joe Wagner (X33143) and the draft should be emailed to John Porter:  japorter@tva.gov Joe would like an update.  John Porter will direct to a TVA lawyer.  Thanks. Sara 
I don't know who is going to work on this one, but I just wanted to remind you that we had that big file with lots of due diligence on the TVA... 
Attached please find the proposed credit terms for the ISDA Agmt.  Comments or questions, please call. Ed Sacks 
FYI 
Hi Sara, The Enron entity is Enron Metals Limited (which formerly was Metallgesellschaft Limited) I can evaluate the credit, and also Anna Shaw, Hamish Scutt or Lindsay Edmonds, so if you send a request would appreciate if you copy all of us. Thanks a lot Diana 
Diana: I negotiated the Enron North America Corp.  ISDA Master Agreement with the ""President and Fellows of Harvard University"" (together with John Suttle). Harvard is interested in metals trading.  What is the entity trading metals (financial)?  Will you evaluate the credit? Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 
Please add your outstanding guaranties to Susan's memo - thanks

Does anyone have this file?  The master was executed on 2/28/92.  Thanks. 
Steve: I just spoke with Bill Bradford and I understand that Bill and Mark Tarkington discussed the use of ""Specified Entity"" and agreed, subject to DB committee approval, to eliminate the use of Specified Entity in the ENA and affiliated masters with DB (i.e., ""Specified Entity:  none"").   Once you have confirmed this with Mark, please prepare a final blacklined draft for our review and then execution copies of the ISDA Master Agreement.   In connection with the final draft, Tana Jones will fax to you minor format comments.  [She will also fax to you the electronic trading agreements and password applications for London and U.S. based trading.] The following ENA affiliates will also need to execute ISDA Master Agreements with DB: (1)  ECT Investments, Inc. (Delaware corporation) (2)  Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (Delaware corporation) 
Left message with Steve Kessler to follow up on finalization of documents. Also, asked Steve about EOL ETA/password application and who was handling. Click on this link to view the document in the Financial Trading Agreements 
Larry: According to Steve Kessler (the DB lawyer in New York who is negotiating the ENA ISDA Master), London e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the London lawyer (Conrad Libischer at 44-20-754-52705).  If  NY trader is also involved, then DB must decide on one lawyer to handle password application, etc. The ENA ISDA Master must first be approved by Frankfurt.  I don't know how long this takes. You may want to let the DB trader start the EOL process.

I have attached a credit worksheet per Sara's request in order to amend the B of A master.  My understanding is that we intend to only amend the existing document for holding and use of collateral so that we may be able to rehypothecate collateral.  I have tried to construct the worksheet terms such that they reflect what is in the current document, but the old document terms should govern in the case of a discrepancy.  I will be out tomorrow, so please contact Bill with questions. Thanks, Tanya 
Tana:  Here's the background info.  Do you want to prepare the ISDA CSA?  We will also need an amendment to replace the old with the new.  I now need to reread Tanya's message.  Sara 
Sara, With respect to the amendment to the B of A ISDA Credit Support Annexe, the contact at B of A is James Allred (MD Energy Finance Group & Credit Products). He will pass the docs onto the relevant lawyer. Tel: 713 651 4830 Fax: 713 651 4841 james.r.allred@bankofamerica.com As you suggested, I have spoken with Tanya re. the Credit Support Annexe, & she will be sending you a worksheet. I have left messages with Teresa re. Mahonia docs. I would be grateful if you would speak with her so that we have consistency in the Chase & Mahonia contracts. Please give me a call if you need anything else. Many thanks,

Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market. In that regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds.  Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have the ""choice"" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this option. LEGAL:  When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13. CREDIT:  When drafting credit worksheets, please be  specific when requesting types of Eligible Collateral other than cash. We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of 
Richard: The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all reside in the U.K.  I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney for executing documents in Houston. As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking  for verification from Janine. My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement and include the usual ""affiliates, representatives, etc."" who may need to know any confidential information.  Your V.P.'s are all in London. If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have a V.P. sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.  At a minimum, though, we should try to work from our form of NDA. Let me know if you have any questions.

It is not clear to me how we should handle this, what do you sugguest?  As a note, I will be out of the office on Friday. 
Tana, I guess we need to change the Enron legal entity from Enron Corp? In our current model the transacting entity will be Enron North America (which is a Delaware corporation?) Can you then arrange a suitable signature (Haedicke?) Can we get this done by the end of Friday? Thanks, Richard 
Richard, Craig told me you could review and sign this confidentiality agreement, naturally it might need a little editing. 
John and Denis-- Here is the proposed confidentiality agreement.  I wasn't sure about the exact name for you, so I just put in the generic ""Enron"".  Let me know if this is okay.

Sara You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors and officers. The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, rather than a director? Kind regards Guenther Klar

Per my earlier email and the one below, could you please let us know about the 2000 Defintions?  Thanks.  Sara 
I got a copy of 2000 Definitions Annex via distribution today.  However, I did not know of nor do I have the 2000 Definitions, which apparently restated/conformed the 1991/1998 basic ISDA definitions.  Our Master still refs 1991, as amended etc., so it probably does pick up the 2000 issuance by ISDA.  Do you have the 2000?  Do we need to order?  Should we consider revising the master agreement in respect of the definition incorporation

Everybody, Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the status of the master. Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling this and pass the info on. 
I will need to be at my home today and tomorrow at 4 pm for repair 
The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm. If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  Sara Tana Jones 08/07/2000 10:52 AM 
I thought this was what we were already doing.  Sara, Mark, wasn't that your understanding? Brent Hendry@ENRON 08/07/2000 10:45 AM 
When the Master does not have the weather modification to the Trade Option Exemption representation then I think we should include it in the confirm. Is this feasible? Tana Jones@ECT 08/07/2000 10:25 AM 
Tanya forwarded the attached confirm on to me.  Are we supposed to have that weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master?

Molly, Could you send me an electronic version of the ISDA that was signed between ENA and PEC. I understand from our attorney that we did not work with an electronic version, only a hard copy. In order to create an ISDA template for MEH, I need the electronic version.

I am on vacation during the week of Oct. 9.  Sara Brent Hendry@ENRON 09/13/2000 04:28 PM 
I will be coming into the office late tomorrow morning, I will be waiting for a second phone line to be installed.  I will be working on some weather deals from home.  I will be available at my home number if anyone needs to reach me.  My number is 281 866 8797, my cell number is 832 368 3286. I would like to take the following Wednesdays as vacation days if it does not cause a conflict in staffing:  September 27, October 11, October 25 and November 8.   I would also like to take December 27 through 29 as vacation days.  Please let me know if this will be problem. 
Sara: Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want. How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing? I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are having fun. Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he ever wants to play some tennis, please call us. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Tana:  attached are the L/C provisions for the Deutsche Bank Master.  Would you please verify that the provisions are in fact our language?  Thanks.  Sara 
Per Steve Kessler's request, attached please find Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of Annex A:  Letter of Credit Provisions.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Regards, Kelly (See attached file: Exhibit A.doc) 
North America Corp. 
North America Corp. Hi Sara-- There are open issues regarding the L/C faciltity, so Carol and I decided not to comment on specific clauses until those issues were resolved.  I believe Carol was ok with Section 18, but it was added shortly before she left for maternity leave.  Because we are still trading with you under the existing BT ISDA, the clause is simply meant to sweep-in any exisiting BT-Enron trades under the new DB-Enron facility. Please let me know if you have any further questions.  My understanding is that we are now scheduled to talk on Wed. at 11am NY time. I look forward to talking with you then. Regards, Steve Sara.Shackleton@enron.com on 09/08/2000 04:36:32 PM 
North America Corp. Steven: I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.  I have a few questions prior to our comments.  They are: (1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit Provisions which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of Annex A.  I did not see your response. (2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see your response. (3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that DB acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have both parties agreed as to existing transactions? Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara

Attached is my suggested language.  The confirms already provide for Market Quotation and Second Method; the Optional Early Termination provision should be the only exception for using the Calculation Agent for termination purposes.  Of course, the Calculation Agent will determine AECO prices for payment purposes, but that is not related to termination. 
Attached are revised commodity swap confirms.  I didn't change the rate swap and we're still waiting for input from the bank.

Do you need to pass this on to Greg? 
Canada, Ltd. Sara, Carol and Rod are working on the ISDA comparison for a potential ISDA between ENA and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  Last week, Cregg Lancaster furnished Reliant's newest form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 for our review.  You may want to visit with Carol as to the status. Also, it is my understanding that once we have the ISDA between ENA and Reliant in place, that that form of agreement would be used for the ECC and Reliant Canada agreement (with the exception of the provisions specific to Canadian entities). Hope this explanation help. Susan Sara Shackleton 04/25/2000 01:48 PM 
Ltd. FYI new request.  What about our master tax agreement? 
Ltd. Sara, I didn't realize that Shari had left the financial swap group.  She just sent me an e-mail telling me that she thought you were handling the negotiation of ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, so I thought I would forward this message I sent to Tana today for your information. Thanks Greg 
Ltd. Tana, I received a request this week from Jannalyn Galloway of Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd. to commence the process of putting an ISDA in place between Enron Canada Corp. and Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  We recently finalized a Master Physical Agreement between these parties and I was wondering if you could commence the process of obtaining credit approval to do the ISDA and provide a draft to Jannalyn.  Her fax number is 713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as above. Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me know. Greg 
Greg:  I spoke with Joe and he IS working on the internal rate swap with John (i.e., ECC/RMT and RMT/ENA).  Sara 
Greg, The matrix I was given doesn't mention an internal rate swap.  I'll have to check with John Griffith in Structuring. Sara, Do you know if the Interest Rate swap is also being backed out to RMT? Thanks Joe Greg Johnston 10/02/2000 02:54 PM 
Joe, I understood that there should be an internal interest rate swap in addition to the commodity swap that you just faxed back to me.  Is someone other than you preparing that document? Thanks Greg 
Steve:  Just thought I'd follow up since our conversation of 9/13 to see if you have had an opportunity to redraft the ISDA Schedule and CSA, and, whether you have reviewed the guaranty which Tana Jones delivered to you shortly thereafter.

Sara and Jason:  The changes you last sent with regard to this matter were all acceptable to FPL and we agree the documents are in final form, except, however, for the Enron guaranty.  I have enclosed clean and marked copies of the guaranty with those revisions we would request and I would hope that none of them would be controversial.  In the hope that the enclosures might upon your approval of the revised guaranty be a ""final"" set, I have also enclosed a clean copy of the ISDA Schedule in the form agreed upon (I have not enclosed a marked copy as the only new changes are in the guaranty attached as Exhibit A thereto).

You are correct. By copy of this message,  I will ask Tana to finalize.  Sara William S Bradford 10/25/2000 07:55 AM

Sara, An Interest Rate swap was entered into with the above counterparty in October 1997.  This was part of a large structured Coal deal.  (Coal Capital Co.?)  I believe the confirm was created in Legal.   Is it possible for me to get a copy of this confirmation?  We are having a real problem getting this settlement booked each month, so we want to refer to confirm to see what is said.  I am out next week, but could you ask someone to send a copy to Todd 
ENA  sent execution copies of the ISDA to Kellogg Company on April 10.  By copy of this email, I ask that you touch base with Tana Jones in Houston who will verify the status of ENA's ISDA with Kellogg Company and send you copies of our documents for use in your negotiations.  Let  me know if you have any questions.  Sara Deepak Sitlani 05/02/2000 06:55 AM 
Sara Paul Radous asked me to get in touch with you in connection with a proposed ISDA Master Agreement with Kellog Supply Services (Europe) Limited.  I should be grateful if you would send me by e-mail all documents relating to the ISDA recently executed between ENA and Kellog's as Paul would like us to use similar provisions. In passing, I should point out that both I and my colleague, Michael Khajeh-Noori, will be dealing with this matter.  I am in the office on Mondays and Tuesdays and Michael is in the office on Thursdays and Fridays. I should therefore be grateful if you would address any e-mails to both of us (we can both be contacted on the same extension: 34539). If you have any questions, please let me know. With kind regards Deepak Paul: will you be preparing a credit worksheet for this entity? 
FYI 
Paul We have recently concluded an ISDA with The Kellogg  Company in the USA. Now their European entity, Kellogg Supply Services (Europe) Limited of The Kellogg Building, Talbot Road, Manchester M19 0PU, UK, would like to see an ISDA Mastera and Schedule. Can you look at this entity from a credit point of view please? I do not have separate financials for them, but if you need them will ask for a latest set.

Steve: I just spoke with Bill Bradford and I understand that Bill and Mark Tarkington discussed the use of ""Specified Entity"" and agreed, subject to DB committee approval, to eliminate the use of Specified Entity in the ENA and affiliated masters with DB (i.e., ""Specified Entity:  none"").   Once you have confirmed this with Mark, please prepare a final blacklined draft for our review and then execution copies of the ISDA Master Agreement.   In connection with the final draft, Tana Jones will fax to you minor format comments.  [She will also fax to you the electronic trading agreements and password applications for London and U.S. based trading.] The following ENA affiliates will also need to execute ISDA Master Agreements with DB: (1)  ECT Investments, Inc. (Delaware corporation) (2)  Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (Delaware corporation)

Larry: According to Steve Kessler (the DB lawyer in New York who is negotiating the ENA ISDA Master), London e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the London lawyer (Conrad Libischer at 44-20-754-52705).  If  NY trader is also involved, then DB must decide on one lawyer to handle password application, etc. The ENA ISDA Master must first be approved by Frankfurt.  I don't know how long this takes. You may want to let the DB trader start the EOL process.

I have attached a credit worksheet per Sara's request in order to amend the B of A master.  My understanding is that we intend to only amend the existing document for holding and use of collateral so that we may be able to rehypothecate collateral.  I have tried to construct the worksheet terms such that they reflect what is in the current document, but the old document terms should govern in the case of a discrepancy.  I will be out tomorrow, so please contact Bill with questions. Thanks, Tanya

Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market. In that regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds.  Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have the ""choice"" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this option. LEGAL:  When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13. CREDIT:  When drafting credit worksheets, please be  specific when requesting types of Eligible Collateral other than cash. We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of 
Richard: The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all reside in the U.K.  I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney for executing documents in Houston. As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking  for verification from Janine.

Your V.P.'s are all in London.

Richard, Craig told me you could review and sign this confidentiality agreement, naturally it might need a little editing.

Richard, Craig told me you could review and sign this confidentiality agreement, naturally it might need a little editing. 
John and Denis-- Here is the proposed confidentiality agreement.  I wasn't sure about the exact name for you, so I just put in the generic ""Enron"".  Let me know if this is okay. Call me if you have any questions, and I'm looking forward to reaching an agreement with you. Thanks.

Guenther: Thanks for the response.  I'll wait to hear from Richard Sage as to who owns the information. Only officers at the VP level or higher may execute binding contracts for all Enron U.S. companies (bylaws).  I do not know the ""rule"" for non-U.S. companies (although I suspect the articles of association would contain that information).

Sara You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors and officers. The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, rather than a director? Kind regards Guenther Klar

The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to ""Other Agreements"".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks! 
You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the inclusion of ""Other Agreements"" in the ""All Agreements"" section as the system is currently designed. I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago. The system is confusing.

It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the ""Other Agreements"" section, to house these other agreements.  My understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously. The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement is a very bad idea. Sara Shackleton 03/14/01 05:35 PM

Elisabeth: I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications? Martin

Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem. In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume. Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations. Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian counterparties. Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.

The changes we are making are not substantive so let's make 'em (marked in yellow on the hard copy I've delivered to you) and get this signed right away.  Clem is going on vacation Friday.  We should also email a copy to Jack Foley when the revisions are made.  PG&E will send execution copies to me.  The paralegal handling this is Maryann Friel at (415) 973-4599. Thanks for your help.

Jack:  I just spoke with Karola and she tells me that you want to talk about the guaranty.  I didn't recall if you had ever reviewed our proposed format. Also, I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a ""General Guarantee Agreememt"" on behalf of Enron North America Corp. (formerly, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) on January 28, 1998.

I don't know if you are the one working on this specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties. I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension is 36900. Thanks, Steve 
Attached is an ENA form of confirmation for a Gas Daily swap (documented under an executed ISDA Master Agreement).  Sara 
Kay:  I left you a voice mail yesterday at Sheila's suggestion regarding Midwest.  Greg and I discussed the use of ENA's format of ISDA documentation by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used, whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?). Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request.. Thanks.  Sara Greg:  I will have the boilerplate sent to you separately. 
I'm free after 11 am - Sara

Looks like 2/3 of the way down on pg. 2 he clearly says we have a deal pending the LC, a requirement which we later waved. Doug 
Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit). Thanks, Alan 
I am forwarding a resume from an Enron Argentina legal candidate who is perhaps interested in ENA. 
Sara; I am forwarding to you a copy of Esteban Buljevich's resume for your review. We have interviewed Mr. Buljevich for our BA Office, but we would think that he would rather pursue an opportunity with Enron North America.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could forward Esteban's cv to the appropriate people within ECT and ENA. Thanks, Sami 
Sami: Thank you for your emails this morning.  Attached is a copy of Esteban Buljevich's c.v. as you requested as well as a copy of his list of selected transactions.

Caroline: Fred wants to meet in the afternoon.  Does Tuesday afternoon work for you (after 3 pm)? Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com Caroline Abramo@ENRON 04/20/2001 03:30 PM 
I look forward to meeting with you both on Tuesday.  Here's a list of the funds we have in the pipeline and the status: MACRO FUNDS- 1.Harvard (Docs done)- We have been dealing with them in crude, products, and natural gas- we just need to keep track of their credit line. 2. Tudor- we have docs with Ospraie, Tudor Proprietary, Tudor Offshore (Bermuda)- dealing regularly.. 3. Catequil (Negotiating) docs with Offshore and Onshore- waiting for response from Brent and Paul on their latest comments to the ISDA.  Confirms from all the deals we have done have been returned to Carol.  They are set up in the system; we hold margin. 4. AIG (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- need to get documents out to them- credit work sheet in legal.. still have not gotten out a confirm to them on the trades they have done....we have them set up in the system and hold margin. 5. Union Spring (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- should be done on this one. 6. SAC Capital - possibly only one vehicle in Anguila- need to get the document to them- credit work sheet in legal. 7. Quark Power (Negotiating)- 2 entities- Quark Power and Amaranth.  Held by Paloma Partners- waiting for their comments on a few points. 8. Valentis and CD Holdings- Held by Wexford Capital - need to get document to them- credit work sheet in legal.  They want to proceed with the 8 year deal Monday. 9. Global Advisors- trade through Cargill.. Frank Sayre working on POA.. waiting for this back. 10. Argonaut- onshore, offshore vehicles- sending documents.. no credit assessment yet. 11. SOROS- brought through system by credit derivative group.. but need a credit opinion for ENA (to do energy trades). PROGRAM FUNDS- 12. Renaissance - credit worksheet in legal- need to get docs to them. 13. Campbell+ Co - will likely want to look at a three way transaction between Enron, themselves, and a bank 14. Sunrise Capital - getting documentation. 
Caroline: I am in the midst of preparing these annexes now. You should take special note of the credit that Paul is insisting upon (seems to be similar to AIG).  This is all credit - but note his Additional Termination Event if the ISDA is not executed within 60 days.  You must discuss all of the items with your counterparty. Also, if you do the deal(s), give me the name, phone/fax numbers, email addresses of all commercial and legal for your counterparties. Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com 
Here are the credit worksheets for Valentis (25% of the trade and Independent amount should be allocated here) and CD Holdings (75% allocated here).  This will work for the ISDA, and I am hearing from Caroline that they are ok with posting this up front amount in cash.  So, for purposes of the Deemed ISDA, we may as well include all of the credit provisions, but make the $2MM a ""Special Independent Amount"" applicable to the counterparty, which may be increased by Enron up to $5MM. This Special Independent Amount should be added to the Independent Amount as that term is used in the ISDA in order to give us the ability to demand more collateral at will with respect to the long term hedge.  Given the fact that the c/p can post cash instead of LC's I see no reason for us to always have the Special Independent Amount in cash. That is, if we are $2MM out of the money on the position, I do not have a problem returning their cash, so long as it is in increments of the rounding amount. So I think we should just go ahead and put credit into these Deemed ISDAs, and require that the failure of the parties to execute an ISDA within 60 days will constitute a termination event. Caroline, again, the c/p will have to verbally agree to Loss instead of market quotation, to the special margining provisions with respect to this particular long term trade, etc.  Let's discuss how this will work, since it is different from what I proposed on the phone. Sara, after you have had a chance to look at these, give me a call so we can discuss. Thanks. Paul

Do we have an outside counsel memorandum, or will we have an internal one soon, that we can send to Martin (as well as the other non-US swap lawyers)? 
can you help Martin w this thanks 
Elisabeth: I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications? Martin

Here's a recap for everyone. Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear. However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement. Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the existing agreement to ECI.

Sara, I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to Reduce funding to 20% per side. I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the finalization of the agreement. Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this execution taken care of immediately? Thanks, Tom 713-853-9074 
Stewart: I spoke with Rawleigh White (Tribal CFO) and the Tribe's outside counsel the other day.  Pending receipt of Tracy's credit worksheet, I'll send the Tribe/lawyers a ""sample ISDA without credit"" which is not specific to the Tribe.  The lawyers will begin to determine if the Tribe is an ""eligible contract participant"" for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. Rawleigh wants to know if Enron is interested in helping the Tribe finance the purchase of the two dams.  Can you please address for West Origination and respond to Raleigh? Thanks.

Susan: I've spoken with a new Indian tribe and need to send the ""sample governmental ISDA"" to several people.  I""ll forward the names/addresses to you.  Stewart Rosman is the commercial person and he should be copied as well as Tracy Ngo.  Please include the following message (verify the question I left for you) with the attachment: ""Per our recent conversation, please find attached a sample Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - Susan, can we send?) which is not tailored specifically for the Tribe.  We will be able to provide a specific Schedule and Paragraph 13 after our credit group has concluded its review.  You may already be familiar with the ISDA Municipal Counterparty Schedule and will note that although we are incorporating many of those provisions.

Here's a recap for everyone. Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear. However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement. Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the existing agreement to ECI.

Sara, I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to Reduce funding to 20% per side. I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the finalization of the agreement. Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this execution taken care of immediately? Thanks, Tom 713-853-9074

Hey, Jason: Hope you're doing alright.  I received a call from NY and before I called back, I checked the infamous Lotus Notes.  It seems that you were going to send a letter to NY summarizing the outstanding issues (I think there was only one issue).  Please let me know if this was ever done.  Thanks. On a sad note, I don't know if you heard but Samantha's 19-month old daughter (adoption not final) was killed in a tragic car accident last week.

Agreement 
Serge: Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things: (1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about? Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility? (2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit  goup to react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Maria: I was waiting to see if Jason Peters ever sent a ""position letter"" to you when we brought this negotiation back inhouse.  Absent that information, it appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the disruption fallbacks, in particular, your request for both you and ENA to each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes (the ultimate fallback).  We cannot agree to your request.  The last database entry I reflect was in October, 2000, when we were having difficulty obtaining your response. Given the lapse of time, we could try to generate a blackline and review the status.  Please let me know what you would like to do.

Sara, I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to Reduce funding to 20% per side. I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the finalization of the agreement. Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this execution taken care of immediately? Thanks, Tom 713-853-9074

Martin: How are things going? In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies of external lawfirm memoranda.  Yes, ENA has changed its ISDA Schedule form to provide for the ""eligible contract participant"" rep and line of business. I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted to ECTRIC. Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would lilke to see regarding the new legislation.  Please note that the act is very broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC ""know-it alls"") and addresses many types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

Hi Sara Can you shed any light on the issues below? Martin 
Elisabeth: I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact on our standard reps relating to the ""trade options exemption"" and as to the parties being ""eligible swap participants"" (are they still required)?  Is there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications? Martin 
Anna: I know that you have been negotiating with Cheryl Nelson about the new ECI account.  I am receiving urgent calls from ECI traders and hope you give me some answers since Cheryl is in a meeting. Can we execute the ECI agreement today? Have we agreed on the assignment? Does the assignment also provide for the transfer of the Master Securities Loan Agreement? Regarding the new ENE guaranty, Cheryl has told me that this was already requested.  I'll check on the expedited delivery date. Please call me when you receive this email.

We're glad to hear that you are coming and we're looking forward to seeing you again. You can fly into any one of the three Washington area airports.  Reagan National is the closest (about 35 minutes by car in non-rush hour traffic), Washington Dulles is about 40 minutes away and BWI is about 50 minutes away. That is generally our order of preference in looking for flights.  However, flights into BWI in general may be cheaper than flights into Dulles or National, and National tends to be the most expensive.  You need to check all three as to price, because airfares change frequently and sometimes USAir or another airline will quote a decent price into National.  Once you have decided which airport you will be using, let us know and we will e-mail directions. 
Enron North America Corp. will be the contracting party.  For your information, Enron Corp. is the parent.  The street address is listed below (the ""EB"" number is my location).  Please call me in the a.m. for other questions you may have. Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax)

RECAP:  This is Project Moosehead.  After the meeting, we determined that the transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption.  The Fixed Price is the premium.  The Strike is the Cap Price (remember, strikes are for options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals).  We'll need to revise today to send in the morning.  CP is ""Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc."". Enron party normally is ENA but we may change to EPMI and create a new ISDA Master for the deal.  There must be a zero floor (ie, no negative payments in the other direction).  Don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal. Could you begin revising?  Also, do the calculations work?  Please feel free to call me as I'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes on.  SS

Ken: Good idea!  Carol St. Clair is handling this agreement.  Please give her a call at X33989. Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com 
Sara, Paul Radous passed the Inland Paperboard ISDA over to me.  (Thanks, Paul!) Jim Crump forwarded me the 43 issues they had with the document.  Since I am not familar with where we are, I would like to get together to talk about their issues and decide how best to move forward.  Please let me know if you have some time to get together. Thanks, Ken Curry 
(1)  The only agreement that ENA is assigning is the Securities Loan Agreement. (2)  Remember, ENA is also assigning the ""credit book"" (identified in Sheila's earlier email and more clearly identified in Tom Doukas' email of yesterday which I forwarded to ;you yesterday).

Sara, I am on hold on a conference call but wanted to talk with you about some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we know it executed).  But for my own understanding: 1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a Securities Loan Agreement? Cheryl Nelson Senior Counsel EB3816 (713) 345-4693 
Sheila and Tom need to know the status.  Please advise them mid-day. Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com Cheryl Nelson@ENRON Sent by: Cheryl Nelson@ENRON 03/28/2001 10:04 AM 
Hi Sara and Sheila, By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's lawyer today about whether we could get the other agreements (account and assignment) executed today and she represented that (1) she is still waiting for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every hour or so for a status update. Cheryl Nelson Senior Counsel EB3816 (713) 345-4693 Sara Shackleton@ECT 03/27/2001 06:59 PM 
Wednesday, March 28 is the target execution date for the ECI customer agreement and assignment (from ENA) of the Securities Loan Agreement/credit book.  I am not certain if Cheryl was able to expedite delivery of the new ENE guaranty.

Tom, The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was executed and the ECI piece is what is in process. Sara, Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from anyone? Thanks. Sheila Tom Doukas@ENRON 03/26/2001 11:59 PM 
Just wanted to follow up to see if we have a time frame as to when the letter will be fully executed. Thanks, Tom 
Here's a recap for everyone. Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear. However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was ""too old"" and that we negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and Enron Credit Inc.. (""ECI"").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement. Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the existing agreement to ECI.

Sara, I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to Reduce funding to 20% per side. I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the finalization of the agreement. Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this execution taken care of immediately? Thanks, Tom 713-853-9074

Sara - I would like to discuss with you a potential opportunity at WAPA Sierra Nevada.  We have just sent them an EEI and would like you to send them an ISDA.  Basically in the near future they might find themselves quite short due to a PG&E contract being invalidated.  If that happens they will either: 1. Buy physical power from the market (use our EEI) 2.Do a financial swap with the market and continue to do the physical index with PG&E (there are some reasons for this which I am not 100% sure on).

Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem. In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume. Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations. Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian counterparties. Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.

If we do, then who do I contact or ask Richard Sage to contact to get this information re: the correct slate of officers updated?  No one has advised me of these steps.  And actually, if we have to do this, I would like Stephanie to take the lead on finishing her work on this part of the project. 3.

Jorge:  I may send you some emails throughout the day to help clarify some things for me. Where are your definitions of ""Calculation Period"" and ""IPA Modified Calculation Period""? In your definition of ""IPA Floating Rate Payment"", you use the term ""Share Spread"" which is not defined.  What do you mean?  There is a dangling definition of ""Share Spread"" at the end of the IPA Compensation section, but it refers to spreads appearing in either Annex I or Annex II. In the ""IPA Compensation"" section, how is ""a negative IPA elected""?  Who is making an election? Let's discuss tomorrow.

George: 1.  You didn't answer my question about ""Calculation Period"" and ""IPA Modified Calculation Period"". 2.  Are you saying that EEL ""elects"" to increase/decrease the Basket Component Shares? Are you saying that the ""IPA Number of Shares"" is negative or the IPA is negative? Is the IPA negative when the Initial Price exceeds the Relevant Price?

Good Morning Sara, ""Share Spread"" is not applicable and should be deleted. A negative IPA is subject to a specific swap traded. It would have to be a case where the Stock is already part of the Basket and they elect to unwind the swap and reduce the number of shares from the basket. For example, if 10,000 shares of XYZ Company were part of the original basket, they can trade off 5,000 shares of the swap effectively creating a negative IPA. The trade is mutually agreed upon. Looking forward to meeting with you! Jorge

Cheryl: 1.  Check the comments for Ms. Lewis' information. 2.  No, I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were essential.  I did not say that accompanying docs were not required.  I suggested that someone should verify with Cheryl Lewis.  Often, the broker will rely on our relationship and subsequent delivery of accompanying docs. This must be determined on an ad hoc basis.

Hi Sara, I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on my calendar for tomorrow. My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis. Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and therefore are not possible to reschedule.

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis. Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and therefore are not possible to reschedule.

Cheryl: Just a bit of history:  I think that the partial listing of officers on the (authorized traders) list is only meant to be illustrative of corporate officers and directors.  The ENA unanimous consent for the relevant company is the authority for document execution.  If, for example, a VP is authorized to execute for a particular company (by virtue of a corporate resolution or unanimous consent) and that particular VP's name does not appear in the partial listing, exection is not invalidated.  The execution is valid. Have you had a broker question ENA's authority?

generally and right away Hey Stephanie, we need to revise this list because it does not make sense at least with respect to ENA.  It does not list key people (e.g. Gary) and it is inconsistent with the resolutions.  For example, the resolutions say that a managing director and treasurer can be a designated person to open an account but ENA does not have such an officer.  There are MD's and then there is a VP and Treasurer.  There are I think other inconsistencies we need to clear up to avoid having the accounts invalidated.  Having these points clear is especially important where, like now, we won't have Gary or Mark Frevert sign because they are out of town and we need to open the account right away. I know you are swamped so I will work tonight on revising the List for ENA tonight and give the revisions to do first thing in the morning. Can you revise the List for ECT today (or just doublecheck it) so that we do not have a hold up in executing the Goldman International account for ECT first thing in the morning.  I promised Sheila Glover we would execute it right away. Did we open any ENA accounts in the past two weeks and if so, just to be clear, can we send them a list that includes Gary's name and title if he signed. Cheryl Nelson Senior Counsel EB3816 (713) 345-4693

Sara, As way of background, ENA faxed a revised draft of the proposed ISDA Master Agreement to EDEN on December 8th.  EDEN apparently still does not want to render an opinion of ""outside counsel"".  Following-up on the messages from Rodolfo Freyre and Jeff Kabel, have you spoken to either Jeff or Rolo regarding EDEN's not wanting to sign an opinion of ""outside counsel"" in connection with the ISDA Master Agreement.  Has a decision been made with regard to ENA's position on such matter? As for Jeff's quiry, ENA does not have an executed ISDA Master Agreement with AES Corp. Let me know if I can be of assistance.   Thanks.

Marie, I have been talking with Sara concerning Deseret and she indicated that I should contact you if I need short term follow-up on this agreement. Currently, Phil Tice and David Taylor are in final discussions concerning certain language within the Annex of this agreement.  Pending resolution of these issues, I will need to have the confirmation letter to this agreement modified prior to sending to Deseret.  The current language references a price of $33.75 per MWh.  This should be replaced with $34.00 in every case. Please let me know if you have questions.  When Phil and David have come to final agreement, we will need to e-mail a final copy of the agreement to Deseret for initial signiture.  We can then follow-up with a Fed Ex copy for signitures?  Let me know if this is the normal procedure.  We have a deal pending that I would like to close today if possible. Mike 503-464-3836

Hello Sara, Keegan told me that you had asked her today to send to you an updated Brokerage Agreement Status Report.   We (the legal eagles) and the business folks agreed at the last meeting on 3/28 that I would distribute the report every two weeks - every other Thursday.  This works best for me and Keegan. Under that schedule, Keegan and I have planned that the report would be ready for group-wide distribution this Thursday. Cheryl Nelson Senior Counsel EB3816 (713) 345-4693 
Ed: Further to my voice mail of earlier today, the CI guaranty appears to be limited in duration but there is not a specific term.  How long must the guaranty remain effective?

Mara: Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both the Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.  Please note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill, Incorporated guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill, Incorporated ISDA Master Agreement. Also, your change to the setoff language is fine. Let's try to agree to everything this week.  Thanks.

Ed:  For the Additional Event of Default (ratings trigger), do you intend the MAC to apply when only one or both credit ratings disappear? Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) 
Tanya:  Do we need to differentiate between the MAC as used in the CSA and in the Schedule (as an ""Additional Event of Default"") with respect to the disappearance of a credit rating from either S&P or Moody's (or both) based on your usage in power masters? I believe that we agreed that for purposes of the CSA (when S&P and Moody's are indicated on the credit worksheet), both ratings must disappear to trigger the MAC. For purposes of an Additional Event of Default, should we just pose the question to credit?

Mark: When you have a few minutes, I'm glad to discuss continuing ""training"" and balancing workloads. Mary has no one to unload Canada and structured transactions (Global Finance) since Carol does not have time for either.  Angela has no time for equity deals.  I think we need a backup for each.  Perhaps Anne Koehler fits the bill.  Or Cheryl.  Each of Anne and Cheryl need ISDA experience. I don't know Francisco's longer term schedule and maybe you need to speak with him and/or Mark Haedicke about his contined international workload.

Bros. Finance S.A. (""Lehman"") Russ and Richard: The referenced agreement was sent  to you for execution on December 7, 2000.

Yes, ""eligible contract participant""  (""ECP"") is an issue.  Both ENA and ECTRI are Delaware corporations and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the U.S. regulatory agency with oversight for derivatives).  As a practical matter, I understand that ECTRI does have many executed ISDA agreements.  I do not know the volume of ""omnibus"" trades.  However, the ECTRI omnibus should have ECP representations in the annex.

A financial trade v24545 was done with Total International Limited.  This entity is subsidiary of a very good credit customer, TotalElf (S&P rated AA-).  Risk is acceptable, small volumes, short tenor, but from a legal standpoint, I do not think this entity is an ""Eligible Contract Party"" as we have no guaranty support or financial statements to support trading.  I noticed that quite a bit of financial trades are currently booked in London with this customer.  Does Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (London financial) have the same ECP requirements as ENA.  If so, I would like to know how they have established eligibility. thanks brant

Just a head's up on NUI - I'll let you know when I hear from Stacy. Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) sara.shackleton@enron.com 
Since NUI Utilites, Inc. is the rated entity, we are no longer requiring the $50MM NUI Corp gty for this transaction.  However, the financial swap (which should be 40,000/day total for May-Oct) is being documented under  the NUI Energy Brokers, Inc. existing ISDA.  Sara has modified to cross default the confirmation to the Credit Agreement.  Stacy, please share the language you are using for the Transaciton Agreement to compensate for the Credit Agreement expiry in December with Sara so the financial confirmation can be modified as well.  We also need to modify the financial confirmation to state that for this transaction only, NUI must be the Guarantor not NUI Capital. Then we must get a deal specific gty from NUI Utilites to cover this trade - probably $10MM.  This all arises because the finc/phys gty we were working on is out the window since NUI Utilities is the rated entity with associated balance sheet and the NUI Corp is not needed.  Please advise asap and call with any questions. Thanks, 
Could you please print.  ss

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon. Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon. Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.) 
Yair: Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining issues, including: (1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is adequate. (2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for dual confirms.  This is too confusing. (3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too subjective.

Investor focus shifted to Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is the Fed's interest rate policy-making body. Although few market watchers expect the Fed to raise rates at the meeting given uneasiness over the Year 2000 issue, speculation has grown that the Fed may change its ""bias"" or predisposition towards future interest rate hikes. General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares rose 1 13/16 (+1.19%) to 153 11/16 on continuing momentum from the company's announcement on Friday of a 3- for-1 stock split, a 17% increase in its quarterly dividend to 41 cents per share, and an expansion of its share repurchase program, In addition to the GE stock split announced on Friday, several prominent companies announced splits last week and today, including Oracle Corp.

Investors in both companies reacted negatively to the news, as shares of Monsanto closed down 5 1/8 (-12.28%) to 36 5/8 and shares of Pharmacia & Upjohn closed down 3 1/8 (-6.22%) at 47 1/8.  Monsanto shareholders were particularly disappointed because they have been pushing for an acquisition involving Monsanto, or at least its agribusiness division, for some time, but given the merger of equals nature of this transaction, they will not receive a significant premium for their shares.
