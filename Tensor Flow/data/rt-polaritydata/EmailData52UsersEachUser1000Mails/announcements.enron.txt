Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately. 
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously. 
NOTICE: Regulations require Enron to meet certain IRS qualification requirements, and to provide the attached information to employees participating in the qualified plans.

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.

Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4. Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. 
Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.

Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. ?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries. ?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. ?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS 
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. ?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries. ?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. ?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.

Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4. Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com. 
What's Next for Enron Federal Credit Union Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months. New Name We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month. Expanded Field of Membership Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union. Additional Location Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members. 
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously. 
NOTICE: Regulations require Enron to meet certain IRS qualification requirements, and to provide the attached information to employees participating in the qualified plans. In addition to attaching informational documentation here, we have also sent, via postal mail, the following notices to the names of those employees participating in the plans 1) Interested Parties' rights to Information and Rights to Notice and Comments; 2) Notices to Interested Parties for the Enron Employee Stock Ownership Plan, 3) The Enron Savings Plan, and 4) The Enron Cash Balance Plan

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.

On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. ?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries. ?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. ?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE NETCO Twas the night before NETCO and the pop fridge was bare and it was not expected that Saint Nick would soon be there. No coke, no milk, nor Cplus could the employees find. So one by one they would trek down to the lobby and pay a dollar' o five. On the trading floor of Enron Canada the phones were all quiet But the nerf football game in progress was an absolute riot. The accountants were busy trying to find us some cash But if you talk to ATB they would swear it was hash. For our leather clad VP's had once ventured forth with visions of banking up here in the north. Our junior clerk was forced to take back our money. A bank not wanting our money, now isn't that funny. In spite of our troubles, oh the parties we've had! Because a good wine or rye makes us feel not so sad. The Christmas party was a spectacular gong show as we showed the country club just how low we could go! The employees' livers have never looked sadder Because we need to discuss what exactly is the matter. and from a bar stool in the best place to watch The freefall of Enron to a 26 cent penny stock. But from these ashes the employees will rise Despite Lay's, Fastow's and Skillings lies Our plan is to emerge as a single A rated NETCO and then we see who will dominate this trading show!!

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge.  ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air. Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.  We are forwarding them to you for your information.  Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.

Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

We have good news for participants of the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  Last Friday, the creditors' committee and our board of directors approved our proposal to reinstate the company match.  We can enact the match in the normal course of business without bankruptcy court approval. Beginning July 1, 2002, Enron will again match employee pre-tax contributions to the Plan.  The match will be credited to active participants' eligible contributions on their first paycheck in July. In addition, from July 1 through December 31, 2002, Enron will double the rate of the company match that was in effect prior to the suspension, with a maximum match on employee pretax contributions of 6 percent of base salary.  In January 2003, the rate of the company match will return to the level in effect prior to the suspension. Beyond reinstating the match, Enron is also instituting the following enhancements to the Savings Plan: ?	The company match will follow participants' investment elections.  In other words, the company match will be allocated to the same funds in which the participant has elected to invest. ?	Currently, participants are able to contribute one to 15 percent of their base salaries to the Savings Plan.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution up to a maximum of 50 percent of their base salary.  The 2002 federal limit for pre-tax contributions to the Savings Plan is $11,000. ?	Participants who are age 50 or older in 2002 will be able to contribute up to $12,000 of pre-tax income to the Savings Plan in 2002.  This additional $1,000 is not eligible for company-matched contributions. Active Enron employees who are not currently participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan have until 3:00 p.m. CST on Thursday, June 27, 2002 to enroll in the Plan for their first July payroll contribution to be matched.  The same deadline applies to active participants in the Plan who may wish to increase their Savings Plan contribution rate in time for the first July payroll.  (For now, participants can only increase their contribution rate to the current maximum of 15 percent of base salary.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution rate to the new maximum of 50 percent.) To enroll in the Savings Plan or make a change to your current contributions, please log on to <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>, or call the Benefit Service Center at 1-800-332-7979, option 3.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. ?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries. ?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. ?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously. 
What's Next for Enron Federal Credit Union Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months. New Name We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month. Expanded Field of Membership Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union. Additional Location Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members. 
Enron's external Outlook Web Access (OWA) (http://mail.enron.com) will be unavailable starting at 11:00 a.m. today until about 12:00 p.m. for emergency network maintenance.

Should you have any questions, please call your Help Desk or Resolution Center. Thank you for your cooperation and support. 
Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.) The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below: The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047. Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002. 
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. ?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries. ?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. ?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural. 
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. 
NOTICE: Regulations require Enron to meet certain IRS qualification requirements, and to provide the attached information to employees participating in the qualified plans.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.

Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002.

Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)

Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee.

With the announcement of the Enron/Dynegy merger last week, I have rethought our planned IT management structure and am making some changes to the recent announcement. This new structure will allow us to focus our existing expertise on Enron's core strengths to ensure we continue to manage these activities effectively and efficiently and lay the groundwork for a successful merger with Dynegy. The changes are as follows: Steve Hotte will return to his lead role in EGS. Beth Perlman will lead the Gas, Coal and other EGM/EIM systems initiatives. Jeff Johnson will report into Beth Perlman. Anthony Dayao will be responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power and EES. Paul Freeman will continue in his lead role in Europe. John Paskin will complete his transfer to head up Corporate systems. Steve Stock will remain heading up the newly formed Enterprise framework group. Jay Webb will continue to run e-Commerce. Jenny Rub will continue to run Infrastructure. Everett Plante will join my management team in a special projects role, focusing on a number of cross business activities in IT and working on the implications of the Dynegy merger. Thank you for your continued support and I encourage you to continue your excellent work and give your full support to the leadership of Enron Networks. 
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately. 
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost. Parking & Transportation Desk

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. 
Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.

With the announcement of the Enron/Dynegy merger last week, I have rethought our planned IT management structure and am making some changes to the recent announcement. This new structure will allow us to focus our existing expertise on Enron's core strengths to ensure we continue to manage these activities effectively and efficiently and lay the groundwork for a successful merger with Dynegy. The changes are as follows: Steve Hotte will return to his lead role in EGS. Beth Perlman will lead the Gas, Coal and other EGM/EIM systems initiatives. Jeff Johnson will report into Beth Perlman. Anthony Dayao will be responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power and EES. Paul Freeman will continue in his lead role in Europe. John Paskin will complete his transfer to head up Corporate systems. Steve Stock will remain heading up the newly formed Enterprise framework group. Jay Webb will continue to run e-Commerce. Jenny Rub will continue to run Infrastructure. Everett Plante will join my management team in a special projects role, focusing on a number of cross business activities in IT and working on the implications of the Dynegy merger. Thank you for your continued support and I encourage you to continue your excellent work and give your full support to the leadership of Enron Networks.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

EMPLOYEE NEWS LINE ENRON POSTS JOBS The company is reinstituting a job posting process to help fill open positions.

Employee's can still update their profile information in eHRonline.  At this time, only current employees will be able to apply for a position from within jobOps.

As Steve Cooper has mentioned in his voicemail messages, there will be an All-Employee Meeting this Thursday, April 11.  The meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m. (CST) in the Imperial Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Unfortunately, the full ballroom was not available until late May, but we did not want to put off the meeting until then. Capacity at the Hyatt will be limited to 1,400 people seated, with additional room for approximately 200 people standing.  As an alternative to attending the meeting, employees in Houston will be able to listen to a live audio stream and view the slide presentation on their computers at http://home.enron.com/employeemeeting/.  The question and answer portion of the meeting will not be broadcasted.  Shortly after the meeting, the audio broadcast and the slide presentation will be available for all employees at home.enron.com. Given the current environment and continuing media interest surrounding Enron, we will take extra security precautions at the Hyatt.  Employees attending the meeting will be required to show their current photo employee badge and each badge will be crosschecked with a current employee list.  No one will be permitted into the meeting without their badge.  Due to space constraints, contract workers will not be permitted to attend the meeting.  We recognize that this security process will take time, so check-in will begin at 7:45 a.m. We apologize for any inconvenience this process creates and appreciate your understanding and patience.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost. Parking & Transportation Desk

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. 
In light of certain upcoming publications featuring some former and current Enron employees, it is important to remember that the company is committed to maintaining a professional environment for its employees.  To do that, we want to keep potentially offensive materials from entering the workplace.  It is inappropriate to have those kinds of publications, in any format, in the workplace, so out of respect for your co-workers, please leave any such materials at home and do your part to ensure that they do not enter the workplace.  We appreciate your cooperation. Robert Jones, Managing Director 
We have good news for participants of the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  Last Friday, the creditors' committee and our board of directors approved our proposal to reinstate the company match.  We can enact the match in the normal course of business without bankruptcy court approval. Beginning July 1, 2002, Enron will again match employee pre-tax contributions to the Plan.  The match will be credited to active participants' eligible contributions on their first paycheck in July. In addition, from July 1 through December 31, 2002, Enron will double the rate of the company match that was in effect prior to the suspension, with a maximum match on employee pretax contributions of 6 percent of base salary.  In January 2003, the rate of the company match will return to the level in effect prior to the suspension. Beyond reinstating the match, Enron is also instituting the following enhancements to the Savings Plan: ?	The company match will follow participants' investment elections.  In other words, the company match will be allocated to the same funds in which the participant has elected to invest. ?	Currently, participants are able to contribute one to 15 percent of their base salaries to the Savings Plan.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution up to a maximum of 50 percent of their base salary.  The 2002 federal limit for pre-tax contributions to the Savings Plan is $11,000. ?	Participants who are age 50 or older in 2002 will be able to contribute up to $12,000 of pre-tax income to the Savings Plan in 2002.  This additional $1,000 is not eligible for company-matched contributions. Active Enron employees who are not currently participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan have until 3:00 p.m. CST on Thursday, June 27, 2002 to enroll in the Plan for their first July payroll contribution to be matched.  The same deadline applies to active participants in the Plan who may wish to increase their Savings Plan contribution rate in time for the first July payroll.  (For now, participants can only increase their contribution rate to the current maximum of 15 percent of base salary.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution rate to the new maximum of 50 percent.) To enroll in the Savings Plan or make a change to your current contributions, please log on to <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>, or call the Benefit Service Center at 1-800-332-7979, option 3. 
All copier and fax equipment in the Enron building is presently being inventoried.  To minimize costs, copiers and fax machines not needed for on-going operations will be returned to the vendors.

As Steve Cooper indicated in the employee meeting, we are undertaking efforts to improve the work environment at Enron.  Two such initiatives are being kicked off next week. First, employees will be able to reinstate I.D. badge purchase privileges.  Beginning Tuesday, April 16, 2002, current Houston-based Enron employees will be able to activate their employee I.D. badge to make purchases at the Energizer, Express Store, and the Plaza Java Coffee kiosk.  Charges will be deducted directly from their paycheck. To activate your I.D. badge for purchases, please follow the steps outlined below: ?	Complete a new I.D. badge charge form.  Forms may be picked up at any cash register in the Energizer, Express Store, and Plaza Java.  A printable form is attached below for your convenience. ?	Sign and date the form.  Doing so authorizes Payroll to deduct charges from your semi-monthly paychecks.  Unsigned and undated forms will be returned to the applicant. ?	Return the form to Richard Hensch at EB1653a, or to any cashier at the above locations. ?	Allow three days for activation. Additionally, there is good news for coffee drinkers.  Beginning Monday, April 15, the operating hours for the Plaza Java coffee kiosk will be extended to 4:00 p.m. for a two-week trial basis.  During that time, participation will be monitored to determine whether the later closing time will be continued. Questions may be referred to mailto:Richard.Hensch@enron.com. 
EMPLOYEE NEWS LINE ENRON POSTS JOBS The company is reinstituting a job posting process to help fill open positions.

Enron has made initial payments toward the purchase of Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs) for Houston Texans Football, and has the right to purchase the associated season tickets.  Enron is no longer interested in these season tickets and is working to secure the best economic result for the estate.  This may involve stopping any further payments, however if there is significant interest among employees in buying the season tickets from Enron, the company may pursue a resale arrangement as one means of recovering the investment it has already made. If you're interested in purchasing any of Enron's PSLs and season tickets for the Texans, please respond by 4PM, Central Time on Wednesday, June 12 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you would be interested in purchasing and the price category.  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined from the employee group, Enron will determine how to proceed in order to benefit the estate.   As listed below, the face value of the PSLs range from $1,900 to $3,900 each, and the face value of the season tickets range from $645 to $2575 each.

While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge.  ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air. Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.  We are forwarding them to you for your information.  Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.

Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience.

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4. Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com. 
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. ?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries. ?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. ?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural. 
Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.) The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below: The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience.

We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047. Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002. 
Many of you have asked about procedures to evaluate employee performance.  We are finalizing a performance process designed to track and provide feedback on individual accomplishments for the benefit of each employee, the company and the unsecured creditors' committee.  A very simple and straight-forward online performance assessment system (PAS) will allow us to automate parts of the process. PAS will open next week on Monday, May 13, and remain open through Friday, May 24, 2002.  As an employee of a debtor company, you should access the system and complete your self assessment by Friday, May 17, 2002.  Your supervisor will review and approve submitted accomplishments and schedule a face-to-face meeting to discuss your contributions, offer feedback, set priorities for the upcoming period, discuss challenges and potential development opportunities, and if applicable, confirm your quarterly retention payout and project a target for the upcoming quarter. 
The past six months certainly have been challenging for all of us at Enron.  With so much change and uncertainty, stress is inevitable.  To help employees better manage stress, Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will sponsor Brown Bag sessions on Tuesday, July 9 and Thursday, July 18 from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the Enron Building, EB5C2.  The group's size for each session will be limited to maximize dialogue, so register early to guarantee a seat.  If necessary, additional Brown Bag sessions will be scheduled to accommodate demand. 
Beginning May 6, 2002, the Doctor's Office in the Enron building will be open on Tuesdays and Thursdays only.  The office hours will remain the same:  7:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m., and 1:30 - 2:30 p.m.  For our employees' convenience, Dr. Ramirez has a second office where she will work Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  This office is currently located at: Greenpark II Office 7505 South Main, Suite 400 Houston, Texas 77030 713-796-8422 Emergency appointments will be accepted on the same day at the respective office.  To schedule an appointment, employees can call 713-750-7074 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 713-796-8422 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This summer Dr. Ramirez will move from the Greenpark II office to the St. Joseph Hospital Medical Towers.  Employees will be notified when the new office is open for business.  Transportation to the St. Joseph office will be available through the St. Joseph Van Services at (713) 756-8267.  The van service requests that reservations be made 24 hours in advance. A third medical services option is available.

Last week, several Enron employees participated in a roundtable discussion for National Public Radio's Marketplace.  The discussion, which focused on working at Enron today and the company's efforts to reorganize, was positive and upbeat.  In Houston, the segment is scheduled to run tonight, April 29 at 6:30 p.m. CST on KUHF 88.7 FM.  Employees outside of Houston should check their local NPR listing for Marketplace air times.  The segment also will be available later today on NPR's website: www.npr.org. 
Effective immediately Enron will begin moving all wireless devise accounts to individual employees for payment.  With all the changes currently taking place within Enron, this change will allow each user to experience uninterrupted service and keep communication flowing while at the same time allow the individual user greater accountability for these controllable expenses. Cell Phones and Pagers Over the next few weeks Enron will be changing the employee payment method of cell phones and pagers, regardless of the vendor.  Optimum base rates and terms of service will be negotiated with pager and cell phone providers for the Houston area. All Cingular and non-Cingular accounts will be rolled under one agreement (see below for Nextel users).  (Field locations are excluded from this change and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as appropriate.)  For billing purposes, this action will require all cell phone users to have the device and service put in their name.  While the phone will be in the employee's name it will be backed by Enron, therefore a personal credit check will not be required and you will not be required to sign a contract.  This change will allow each user to verify their bill for accuracy and to ensure that the bill is paid on time. All monthly charges for cell phone and/or pagers are to be submitted for reimbursement via XMS.  Direct billing and/or group billings will be phased out over the next few weeks.  XMS training and class schedules will be forthcoming. Please follow the steps below to make the necessary changes to your account: ?	Contact your service provider and make arrangements to have your bill paid monthly either by credit card or personal check.  The Cingular contact is Charlotte McGowan, (972) 706-1968.  If you need information regarding contacts for other providers, please contact Darin Lee Carlisle @ Global Strategic Sourcing ext - 5-3808. ?	Submit the expense item to your supervisor for reimbursement through XMS. ?	Do not sign a contract, as you will become personally liable for the account for the life of the contract. ?	Change the address on your bill to either your home address or your current office address to ensure timely receipt of the invoice in the future. Nextel Phone/Two-Way Radios We are currently working with Nextel to restructure billing to individual employees.  All monthly charges for Nextel services will be submitted for reimbursement via XMS.  Pre-approval by Business Unit CAO will be required for all Nextel phone/two-way radios. Long Distance An individual code will be assigned to each Houston based employee for use when dialing long distance calls.  These codes will create individual accounts for each employee so that they can identify their long distance usage and reimburse the company for personal calls they may make. (Field locations are excluded at this time.) Conferencing WorldCom will provide all audio conferencing services.  Monthly conferencing charges will be reviewed and approved by Department heads.  Training will follow under separate cover. Training / Questions Training sessions and additional communications regarding these changes will follow in the next few days.  Please contact Darin Carlisle at (713) 345-3808 or Peter Goebel at (713) 345-3325 with any questions regarding the above changes.  Questions regarding XMS training should be directed to Tammy Hopkins at (713) 345-3631. Derryl Cleaveland, Vice President Global Strategic Sourcing 
As Steve Cooper has mentioned in his voicemail messages, there will be an All-Employee Meeting this Thursday, April 11.  The meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m. (CST) in the Imperial Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Unfortunately, the full ballroom was not available until late May, but we did not want to put off the meeting until then. Capacity at the Hyatt will be limited to 1,400 people seated, with additional room for approximately 200 people standing.  As an alternative to attending the meeting, employees in Houston will be able to listen to a live audio stream and view the slide presentation on their computers at http://home.enron.com/employeemeeting/.  The question and answer portion of the meeting will not be broadcasted.  Shortly after the meeting, the audio broadcast and the slide presentation will be available for all employees at home.enron.com. Given the current environment and continuing media interest surrounding Enron, we will take extra security precautions at the Hyatt.  Employees attending the meeting will be required to show their current photo employee badge and each badge will be crosschecked with a current employee list.  No one will be permitted into the meeting without their badge.  Due to space constraints, contract workers will not be permitted to attend the meeting.  We recognize that this security process will take time, so check-in will begin at 7:45 a.m. We apologize for any inconvenience this process creates and appreciate your understanding and patience.

Central Parking is currently working on the gated access system of the Allen Center Garage to improve its operation.  Over the next four to six weeks, the existing system will be replaced with new, improved technology.

If you experience a problem entering or exiting the garage with your access card, call Martin Katz at extension 59322.  Indicate where the problem occurred (Gold, Green or Blue Garage), whether it was upon entering or exiting, and the time of day the malfunction occurred.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.

Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. ?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. ?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.

Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.

Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4. Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com. 
What's Next for Enron Federal Credit Union Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months. New Name We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month. Expanded Field of Membership Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union. Additional Location Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members. 
NOTICE: Regulations require Enron to meet certain IRS qualification requirements, and to provide the attached information to employees participating in the qualified plans. In addition to attaching informational documentation here, we have also sent, via postal mail, the following notices to the names of those employees participating in the plans 1) Interested Parties' rights to Information and Rights to Notice and Comments; 2) Notices to Interested Parties for the Enron Employee Stock Ownership Plan, 3) The Enron Savings Plan, and 4) The Enron Cash Balance Plan 
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously. 
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.

While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.
