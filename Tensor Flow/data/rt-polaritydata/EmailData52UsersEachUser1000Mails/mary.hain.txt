Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points: There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well. High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt. The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme. The market would function better if more information was provided to the market. The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load. To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, you will find there are many ""hidden"" slides that were not part of the oral presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional information. According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is looking into the data we provided. I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of scarcity . 
We need to be careful how we position this.  I'm concerned that this may be perceived as Enron re-entering the residential market -- even though we're proposing to supply SDG&E rather than direct end-use customers.  How does this compare to the other eight offers SDG&E has received? James D Steffes@EES 08/17/2000 01:38 PM 
Attached is a write-up of a presentation on making a ""public"" offer in SDG&E's territory for supplying their residential load. If we are to do this, we need to probably have something ready by late August. Any comments? 
Just in case you need this for future reference.  I played with it and gave it a simple look.  (You can always delete if you don't like it.) mm 
Mary -- Please send out the same information to Western traders.  We would like everyone to continue to consider the ""shortcomings"" of this model. Christi, please make sure that Mary is kept in the loop on this and Project e-trans as much as possible. Thanks. Jim 
FYI 
Folks, Late Friday afternoon Ziad called me.  The ISO Governing Board earlier the same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to place 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO little choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to cover their peak hours on hot days. Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and California PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am working with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly. We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or earlier. Key people who you may need to contact: ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are also in the loop) PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123 PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124 APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123 APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159 Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have not had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the California PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint WPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this product/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or buy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours of HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can utilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will be watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW. The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery point, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging transmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its purchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will send out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak market.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be posted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post buy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day. You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a buyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap. I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly work together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt the ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going forward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to post bids to sell? gba

On interconnection, I think our approach has been that the ISO should be the party you have an interconnection contract with, not the utility. James D Steffes@EES 09/06/2000 05:29 AM 
Sarah -- Looks fine.  Did Craig Roach contribute? I wonder if we should highlight the Interconnection problems we are having with new generation?  I know that most of the delays are Siting related, but it is unclear to me if the ISO or the local utility is the right point of contact.  This would help us nationally and gives FERC an ""answer"" - enforce your Interconnection policies!! Also, this doesn't mention any possible market flaws.  Do we think that some exist?  Are any of the AS markets manipulated?  EPSA needs to make sure that it takes an honest approach to this situation or its credibility will be destroyed.  Has Craig Roach looked into this?

This information updates the WSCC data and supplies support for the data in my and Tim's presentations.  In particular, it shows that there is more scarcity than we originally stated because the WSCC data relied on assumed that all of the hydro capacity could be used when, in fact, the hydro system is overbuilt such that if all the capacity available were used at Grand Coullee, downstream areas would be flooded. 
Attached are the data responses for EES.  We will be requesting confidential treatment of number 6. 
overall response (See attached file: EESFERCresponse.doc) Please call with questions or comments. Dennis 
Here's the latest info. about the FERC meeting.  Only Commissioners and their Staffs will be attending, no additional FERC Staff (no one from the Office of Markets and Tariff Rates).  The Meeting is mostly an opportunity for customers to blow off steam.  Presentations will be made by the three IOUs, one generator, one marketer (Enron) and one ESP, UCAN, and various politicians.  When I get the list I'll forward it.  Each presenter will have about five minutes with no questions from the audience.  Panelists should expect questions and discussion among panelists or in response to Commissioner's questions. Attached is the latest FERC notice about the California meeting.  It recognizes that there may be discussions about pending FERC cases.  This does not mean FERC will be grilling our panelist about these cases.  Rather, FERC has to issue this notice so if someone talks about an issue pending in one of those cases, the Commissioners don't violate the government in the sunshine rules. (See attached file: EL00-91.1)

Looks fine to me.  Thanks. Jeff Dasovich@EES 09/08/2000 11:03 AM 
Attached are the draft message points.  As always, all comments, suggestions, etc. are encouraged and welcome.  I have five minutes.  Consequently, based on what other panelists say, and general tenor of the hearing, may end up emphasizing some points more and others less in opening, and use any Q & A to round things out.  Joe/Mary:  any final word on format/participants?  Thanks. Best, Jeff 
Tim always tells me EPMI's biggest problem about accessing transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information.  Tim wants all ISO information - as he says ""more, better, faster.""  In other words he wants: meter and outage information, water levels, bids and schedules, actual flows, transmission availability and congestion. Making this information available is necessary for three reasons.  This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market.  It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market.  It would also, as Sue points out, remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders. Susan J Mara@EES 09/08/2000 12:06 PM 
OK.  I'll take a shot in answering your questions, Steve. Others are free to comment as well. The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened.  If you talk to the traders, they LOVE it.  Before April1, 1998, they had no sales to CA.  Now, they have millions of dollars of sales.  Why?  -- no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over. We still have some problems, however.  The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them.  We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them.  We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path 15 probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it. The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path 15. So, what are the access issues? Path 15 is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA.  Has been for years. The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla. When I left PG&E in 1996, the estimated coast was $300 million.  The congestion costs did not justify building the line then. PG&E continues to control Path 15 and tells the ISO what's left after PG&E allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes. There is no transparency.  PG&E has the ability to use Path 15 to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts.  Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesn't think PG&E is, but;... The ISO says it can't interpret PG&E's contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how it's some kind of overseer -- we protested and have now appealed.  The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One -- their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights -- more like interruptible -- but once the ISO started, all of a sudden, the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights (as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff). That's why we have pushed the issue.  Also, Dynegy and Power Exchange (not the PX) have rights on Path 15.  Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated. Information in general is pretty sketchy on real-time transmission.  We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows what's going on in transmission (as do the utilities), changes what it does, which then changes prices, and then doesn't tell us until after the fact.  The ISO has promised to do better, but I don't think has implemented any real changes yet. Advantageous access. Except for what's going on in Path 15, I don't think the IOUs have any advantages on access -- except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro -- but I think it's resource specific, rather than owner specific. The munis are another story.  See next item. Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country.  In making a devil's bargain with the munis, the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation.  The ""sanctity of contracts"" under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents (not the IOUs -- but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs) and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market.  The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munis/Dynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do (e.g., some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins, some get to do it every half hour, so far most haven't had to pay for ancillary services, etc.) There are many, many examples of how we are discriminated against (in addition to Path 15) and of how FERC has shined us on -- but yet we fight on. 
When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.  We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control ""path 15""?  Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there other examples and are there links between these ""preferences"" and the current problems in California?  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us. 
We will be asking for confidential treatment unless and until the FERC requires similar information to be released by all market participants. 
Attached find Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services' responses to the Staff's data requests in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Bulk Power Investigation.  These responses assumes that you sent separate data requests to Enron Wind, so they do not include that information.  The answers also assume you are requesting this information for California (and therefore the Western interconnect) only.  Please let me know if these assumptions are incorrect. If you were requesting Eastern Interconnect information you need to contact Chrisit Nicolay at the above E-mail address.  Enron requests confidential treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Section 388.112.  Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable to respond to question 8 and to provide the Unit Identifier requested in question 4.  We hope to be able to provide this information on Monday. Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-8862.  I will be traveling on 
Ron and Seabron - thank you for responding so quickly and putting together such a good product.  I would suggest only the following additions:  I would mention that the Commission should also require simplified interconnections and encourage faster certification of generation.  You simply touch on hedging, I would explain why, given that they had the  opportunity, it would have been prudent (with a simple example like how going to the spot market and then asking for a price cap is like day trading your retirement and then asking for legislation requiring a minimum price or something like that).  I really like the gas industry discussion.  Seabron, can you verify the 20 loads and 40 gens - that was just a number Tim Belden through out (although he should know)?  If you send me another version tomorrow, fax it to me at the Ritz Carlton at Tysons Corner, I'll be in the Consulate Room from 9-11. After that, call me on my cell phone at 503-807-0929. 
Attached is a draft response to the economics arguments made by the Electricity Oversight Board.  Please let me know if you have any problems with these.  These arguments need a little wordsmithing but they are sound. 
Jim is available at 10:00 pacific time.  Does that work for others?  Jim - Ron suggests having Carl Imparato on the call because of his extensive knowledge of California markets.  What do you think? If you were looking for an attached list, I haven't prepared it yet. James D Steffes@EES 09/14/2000 09:42 AM 
9am Central time is bad for me.  I could do it at 8am Central or 12noon Central.  Don't hold off for me. Jim Mary Hain@ECT 09/14/2000 11:32 AM 
I'd like to have a conference call tommorrow at 9:00 a.m. to review Tim's ""top 5"" priorities to fix the wholesale market in California.  I need to do this tomorrow so Seabron and Ron can write our pleading for the Section 206 proceeding while I'm on vacation next week.  Please let me know ASAP if 9:00 is a bad time or if you don't want to be on the call. 
If you thought I ignored any of your communications last week, I did it because I was on vacation.  I'm back!  I'll catch up as soon as I can. Read attached draft from EPSA. 
FYI 
Thanks Jim.  ENA is very interested in this topic.  I was talking with Mona last week about my view that a strategy with PG&E should be supportive, not adversarial.    ENA is extremely interested in a gas management position with PG&E and they have made it clear to us that our public positions against them are a significant commercial issue.  I will spend some time with Portland and SF to get an ENA consensus on these points. Chris James D Steffes@EES 09/21/2000 09:28 PM 
FYI. If you are not aware, PG&E is pushing for immediate end of their retail rate cap (so they can collect wholesale energy costs). EES is considering its positions in that matter to prepare for CPUC and legislative proceedings. I want to make sure that you are aware of these internal discussions.  Key from EPMI include (1) endorse Cal ISO report conclusions, (2) competititve default supplier, (3) increasing rate freeze for all customers, and (4) transfer of PG&E Hydro to affiliate at $2.8B (to offset current undercollection). Please let me know if these positions make sense to you.  While I think that our general position is retail volatility, given the current situation in SDG&E that is simply impossible politically. Please feel free to call. Jim 
Sounds fine to me. Susan J Mara@EES 09/28/2000 04:04 PM 
WPTF has just voted to file a protest on Amendment 30 (the ISO is asking to be able to buy power for itself in the forward market).  I agreed to fund as did 4, maybe 5, others.  The discussion was not exactly as you describe below but I will be able to have lots of input on the filing, and am sure I can get the points included.  Therefore, I recommend that Enron NOT make a separate filing on this. Here is what WPTF voted on:  Ask FERC to limit ISO procurement only to the super peak product that has already been developed by the APX and require that the price caps end in 6 months; if the ISO wishes to renew the price caps it would have to file 60 days in advance of the 6-month deadline. Mary Hain@ECT 09/28/2000 12:28 PM 
Sue- in WPTF's protest of Amendment 30, is WPTF proposing to make the following arguments?  If not we need to have Ron give an estimate for an RCR and draft a protest. Amendment 30, which would allow the Cal ISO to do limited forward contracting and to allocate the costs thereof to under/overschedulers (protests due Oct.2)the traders would like to say that the ISO should not be in the forward market, rather the IOUs should be in the forward market and should be incented to do so.  Rather than doing anything to fix this failure to hedge and underscheduling by the IOUs, this filing would further amplify the problem by concentrating even more transactions with the ISO and lead to the slippery slope to the ISO running the entire market. Since, the filing also creates other problems.  Through the proposal to do bilateral deals without first receiving bids, the ISO moved itself out of compliance with Order No. 2000 (assuming it ever complied) by starting to violate the independence characteristic - the FERC's first minimum characteristic for an RTO.  Under this, the RTO is required to be independent of market participants.  Order No. 2000 defines a market participant as any entity or its affiliate that buys or sells electric energy in the RTO's region or in any neighboring region that might be effected by the RTO's actions. Further, the ISO is already buying out of market and this move would further complicate existing problems that we have with OOM. In addition, although the filing claims that it's request is  limited, yet there is no time limitation.  Further, the limitation seems to have little real effect. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Unless Chris tells me otherwise, we will continue what we've been saying in California, but I think how we do that without individually naming the utilities is pointing to what the ""IOUs"" are doing in general and clarifying that the IOUs are making logical decisions in light of the mixed up regulatory framework imposed on the market.  That's how we said it at FERC. Is that okay with you Chris? 
I disagree with you about question 2.  While I agree that transmission acess wasn't the number one problem in California this summer, transmission access is not close to being perfect in California (for example PG&E controls the information about path 15 and the ISO still has not auctioned off 100 percent of the FTRs in the market) and certainly corrections to these problems would make the market more liquid which would help to alleviate the price spike problem.  So even though access is not the number one or even the number two problem causing price spikes this summer it contributed and it is one of the biggest problems with the California market, relatively, and it is something that FERC can fix (as compared to fixing hedging and underscheduling which they seem content to leave to the state regulators).  Perhaps Tom could fix his question accordingly. Sarah Novosel@ENRON 10/04/2000 07:41 AM 
Tom: The questions look good, and I agree with Rick's comments regarding RTO participation.  We should try and pin Hoecker down on the problems with the voluntary approach.  I have a couple of additional thoughts on the questions: In question two, you should also ask Hoecker directly about the time it takes to interconnect.  The interconnection process can take a long time due to utility holdups that are not necessary.  I would ask something like, ""What is the length of time it typically takes to interconnect a generator to the grid once the generator makes the request for interconnection?  Can FERC take action to shortened this time to help accelerate the development and operation of new generation in California and elsewhere throughout the

We made a separate filing.  Ron hasn't sent me the final draft.  But when he sends it I'll forward it. 
Attached find a draft of Seabron and Carl's white paper in the Section 206 proceeding with my suggested revisions and comments in redline and strikeout.  I think they did an excellent job.  I have also attached a short (but detailed) outline of the white paper for those of you who don't have time to read the white paper.  If you have any comments on this please get them to me ASAP as I would like to file this paper at FERC on Friday.  Ron Carroll is drafting a pleading to accompany it to FERC. A couple of general comments for Seabron and Carl: I did not move it but the section on information and governance should be moved to the beginning of the paper as these are the most important problems to Enron. It's not always clear whether you are referring to the FERC doing something or the PUC. You may want to add some of the recommendations and observations that the PX made in its recent analysis of price activity: May - July 2000. 
The PX proposed its price cap to become effective on the earlier of October 22. FERC issued a letter requiring the PX to file (and serve on all intervenors (including EPMI)) the following proof by October 20th: Any data demonstrating market distortions without the price caps Any data indicating that in certain hours the PX prices have not been disciplined by the ISO's prices Any data demonstrating that the CalPX Day-of and Day-Ahead and the CalISO Real time markets do not operate in an inter-related manner. Since the data is due on a Friday and the proposed effective date is a Sunday, its seems unlikely that FERC will have enough time to act on the proposal before the effective date unless FERC has the order already drafted.  Either they're just trying to cover themselves or they're trying to find a reason to reject the filing. Ron - please make sure we get this information as soon as it's filed. 
Here's Peace's letter.  Sorry I didn't have time to summarize it. 
No but we found out what they want.  They don't really want all the other stuff they asked for.  What they really want is our financial information (profit and loss). 
We're getting close to a final draft of our filing in FERC's investigation of the wholesale market in California.  So if you would like an opportunity to read it please get me your comments by tomorrow. The motion still does not have a section on governance, but Ron is drafting it and it will simply summarize Seabron's paper.   Also, I made some changes to Ron's draft to require the FERC to find that it has a pervasive system of wholesale regulations in California and that the CPUC is therefore pre-empted from placing restrictions on hedging by wholesale market participants.  I think that argument could be extended to cover the UDC's recovery of stranded costs, but have not added that to the draft.   I wanted to get your feed back first.  If the stranded cost mechanism isn't fixed, I'm not sure that the other market changes we have recommended will be sufficient.  On the other hand, maybe the PUC is on its way to fixing this part of the problem.  Do you want to have this discussion via E-mail or do you want a conference call on this? 
SCE, PG&E and TURN have asked FERC for a $100 price cap and cost-of-service 
The Cal ISO, Williams, AES Corporation, Southern, and Reliant moved that the CPUC modify its protective order.  People are protesting the fact that they have to file their answers before resolution of multiple issues over the protective order.  Williams is threatening to file a motion to quash.  It says ""to the extent the CPUC is conducting a valid investigation within jurisdictional bounds, Williams will cooperate.""  Richard you may want to call their attorney Alex Goldberg to get the details, if you haven't already 
Attached is the cover motion for the section 206 white paper.  We will be filing this tomorrow.  Please remember that due to the time zone, and the time necessary for copying, etc., any comments should be made first thing tomorrow morning.  Thanks.  Ron- please note a few minor edits in redline /strikeout.

Seabron has agreed to write a brief sumary of the Section 206 white paper, in 
Tim gave some final comments to Seab this morning and is getting together some data for him.  Tim will provide the data shortly (today).  Then the paper will be ready for filing.    So please get any other comments to me NOW.  Thanks. 
This paper will be filed at FERC tomorrow.  Here's a copy for you file.  Ron will send us the final version of the cover motion tomorrow. 
I called my friend at FERC.  She said she is working on the report.  She said Staff's biggest problem was all of the requests for confidentiality - that's all she could say.  She asked me to E-mail the white paper directly to her, 
The attached bullets give real-life examples that people will understand.  I also told Karen Denne to reference the bullets at the beginning of our motion if she needs to know what we're requesting at FERC.  Please notify Karen and me if you see any problems with the message. 
I asked Seabron to outline the points to be made in the answer to CMUA pleading.  I took the filing seriously because I think it's pretty well 
FYI Press Release California ISO Offers Market Stabilization Proposal Calls for Forum for Reaching Consensus on Market Power Mitigation FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 20, 2000--Hoping to trigger consensus building that will lead to solutions to volatile energy prices, the California Independent System Operator (California ISO) filed a Market Stabilization Proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today, Friday, Oct. 20, 2000. The plan was unveiled during a news conference at the ISO's Folsom Control Center this morning. California ISO CEO Terry Winter described the plan as a discussion platform -- a document not etched in stone but rather introduced as a means for putting the brakes on market prices and finding long-term solutions that will protect consumers from high bills while stimulating new investment in power plants. The California ISO is asking FERC to consider the following regulatory steps: Institute Payment Cap of $100 in all markets with the following exemptions: Generators that can prove they will lose money if capped on that rate Generators that contract 70 percent of their supply to serve California customers Renewable generation -- Generation facilities less than 50 megawatts -- New power plants -- Imported power The existing $250 per megawatt hour price cap would still exist and serve as the absolute price ceiling for suppliers exempt from the $100 payment cap. ``We cannot simply apply a short-term patch for market power, without also addressing the underlying problems causing sky-high prices,'' said California ISO CEO Terry Winter. ``Consumers have little control over how they can respond to high prices. There are traffic jams on the transmission systems that keep us from moving electricity efficiently around the state, not to mention the fact there are not enough megawatts to meet the needs of consumers. And, the lack of forward contracting scheduling means the California ISO is making up for huge shortfalls ten minutes before the power is consumed.'' Along with providing the incentive for generators (sellers) to sign formal contracts, the California ISO also recommends requiring utilities (buyers) to contract for 85 percent of their customer requirement for power in advance of when it's needed. The lack of adequate forward contracting also adds to an operational problem facing the ISO -- the fact that 20-30 percent of total consumption is frequently bought and sold in the ISO's Real-Time Market, which was designed to handle only five percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets. This problem -- known as under-scheduling -- is also addressed in the ISO's filing by a real-time trading charge. ``Because of the visibility of the ISO's markets -- the fact that we are so public -- and as a result of the distortion of the intended market design, the ISO has been called upon to take on responsibilities it was never intended to handle,'' said Winter. ``This proposal would take the ISO back to its original mission of operating the markets of last resort, allowing ISO operators to focus on maintaining reliability of the power grid.'' The California ISO is chartered by the state to manage the flow of electricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission systems. The not-for-profit public benefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March 1998 when California opened its energy markets to competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over the California ISO to manage. The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity and ensure equal access to an open-market electron highway that spans 12,500 circuit miles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Contact: California ISO Patrick Dorinson, 888/516-NEWS 
The trading flooor needs to formulate a position on this first.  When is your meeting Tom? 
Attached find the second draft of our answer to CMUA's complaint for cost-based rates in California.  Please send me any comments ASAP as this 
FYI 
Please get me your comments ASAP.  Our basic message is that FERC does not have the jurisdiction to make findings about violations (and recommend to the Justice Department)  the Antitrust laws and the Civil Rights Act.  This is due today!

Karen - thanks for getting the word out! PowerPlus ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Seeking to eliminate price caps as solution Enron Pushes Four-Point Fix To CA Wholesale Power Market Broad-scale power marketer Enron, on the eve of the release of a proposed FERC remedy, has delivered a four-point plan of its own to remedy structural problems in the California wholesale power market. Observers say that the power marketer is seeking to push FERC into preempting state rules with structural changes for the California market, rather than continue reliance on price caps and other bidding controls as an interim solution to nascent wholesale power markets. In a white paper submitted to the commission for consideration, Enron tells the commissioners that the ""problem in California is not that competition cannot work but that it has not been given a chance to work because the existing structure of the 
Tom and Cynthia you are cordially invited. 
details for the conference call referenced below are as follows: 
Jim Steffes suggested that we develop message points in anticipation of FERC's ruling on November 1. In this regard, we could:  (1) use the Seabron Adamson paper as our central message; and (2)develop separate messages for a variety of FERC outcomes--e.g., cost-based rates or additional rate caps. To that end, we are scheduling a conference call at 11:00 A.M. (PST) this Friday, October 27. Lysa:  please contact folks on the above-list to see if they are available. Assuming we can reach critical mass for the call, forward AT&T conference calling information to the above-list. 
See the attached short memo from Seabron before our conference call tomorrow.  Seabron has now read the motions/settlement proposals made last week by the CPUC, the Cal ISO CEO, PG&E SCE and TURN, and SDG&E.  Out of all the pleadings, he concludes that only SDG&E raises a new economics issue that we would need to rebut: SDG&E challenges our assertion that requiring utilities to be in the forward market will solve the problem in the California market.   SDG&E also makes a number of policy recommendations that we have not yet addressed in the context of the FERC's investigation that we must oppose because the traders oppose them. Ron Carroll is currently drafting a FERC filing/letter telling FERC that we will not be answering these pleadings within the typical 15 days for filings answers but will instead be addressing these filings in the context of the FERC's November 1 order and assume that by doing so we are not waiving any rights.  That way we can file one pleading rather than many. - 00-10-26 SA Memo on SDG&E response.doc 
One other argument we could make:  according to the traders, the gas market is very liquid.  Because the gas market is very liquid, generators will sell their gas and turn off their units.  So the ISO will create a reliability problem. 
Some comments from Tim on the outline Because the prices are based on L3Day NYMEX prices, when two out of three prices have already been posted, it is impossible for parties to hedge their risk for November.  [For your information but not for the filing - We have a big position for November so we need to get this pushed off until December or we could lose alot of money]. By basing the caps on heat rates from 1999, the ISO assumed that this was the proper test period.  This is not a good test year given that generators lost alot of money in 1999. 
Attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the CPUC's proposal for load based price caps.  Obviously, these arguments would also apply to the ISO Board's recent decision. 
I have no idea.  It sounds like a state regulatory thing.  Maybe someone in the California office knows. 
do you know what the 394.5 notice is that he is talking about? 
It looks fine to me.  Does anyone else have any comments? 
In response to Jim's E-mail  - here's is my proposed list of issues for Enron's November 9 comments.  We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow so please comment on this ASAP. We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information Here's my rationale.  Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market information to market participants.  We could summarize the positions we took in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at all and why we need information.  In addition, we should assume that they will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not addressed the problems created by OOM. In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms, balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues 
In answer to your first point, the FERC did exempt demand side bids from the $150.  See footnote No. 84 of the order. Susan J Mara@ENRON 11/02/2000 01:50 PM 
Gang, I didn't get Jim's e-mail but .....  Here are my comments This looks good as a bottomline message, but I'd like to dress it up and take it out on a date first (doesn't dasovich talk like this?) I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS this summer.  To the contrary, in the west, we were working with some customers (a  few hundred MWs)  to participate in the ISO's program -- after the Board voted to lower the cap to $250 -- the customers all said sayonara -- could no longer justify the expense and the interference in their operations.  These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail demand response. This only goes so far, however... The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids from the price caps.  SO, we need more... I think we should focus on the practical effects of a ""soft"" cap (not simple

We have discovered another problem that we may want to discuss in our oral comments, although the UDCs may cover it.  Even though the FERC removes the forward market prohibition, the UDCs will not be in the forward market because: (1) the PUC may find they were imprudent and (2) the FERC's penalty is only for underscheduling load in the day-ahead or the day-of market, not 
Please add Alan to all of your E-mails about California. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is refusing to sell outside of California for less than $250.  This is diminishing liquidity in the market. However, we can't call FERC and complain because munis are not regulated by FERC.  Here is an example of something we should be bringing to NW 
All I know is they say it to our traders.  The rationale is to keep power in California. 
Mary, For two months now,   the Real Time traders at LADWP say that they either: Cannot buy or sale anything due to political concerns Or Cannot sell for less than $225 due to political reasons. They have not provided any detail behind this decision.    Other market participants,  such as SRP,  Pacificorp and APS  are aware of their policy. We have heard that the price could be less if you are a utility buyer, however,   we have nothing to substantiate this information. JMF 
Here are the FERC presentations.  The first one is Tim's.  It corrects some information in my presentation.  For example, Tim's presentation corrects the hydro generation numbers to reflect the fact that not all hydro capacity equates with hydro energy, if there isn't sufficient water to produce it.  My presentation includes more verbal explanations.  Cooper and Alan - does any of the data in these presentations need to be updated? 
Obviously they enjoy being hit with rotten tomatoes.  Does the facility have a proper security force for this?  Not to say that people in California are reactionaries or any thing . . . .  You can tell FERC's doing it as a symbolic gesture since none of the other commissioners are going. 
As you may already know, the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow. They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" -  this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c).  16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities.  We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's  decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market.

FYI.  This is just a master under which we can do individual agreements. 
We have received the executed Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 11/14/2000 from the referenced CP.  Copies will be given to Legal and Credit. THIS IS AN EDISON ELECTRIC INSTITUTE (EEI) AGREEMENT. 
Attached find the latest draft of Alan's technical paper.  This is still a work in progress.  The paper will serve as the basis for our comments on the FERC's November 1 order on the California market.  Alan developed this paper in close coordination with Tim Belden and Greg Wolfe.  I wanted to run this by you so you would have an opportunity to give us any input from EES's perspective.  Ron Carroll will also be sending us a draft pleading that will accompany this paper.  However, the pleading will simply summarize the positions set out in Alan's paper and lay out a few additional legal arguments, so it is most important for you to focus on this paper.  Ron will be getting us a draft by the end of the day today so we can discuss it in our conference call early tomorrow. 
This is the Tues late a.m. (PST) version of the technical affidavit. Since yesterday's version, the following is most new conversion to Q/A format addition of my quals (are they sufficient?) argument that forward contracting is liquid TODAY (in price caps section) section on information provision has been simplified new arguments with regard to load-based penalties and why they should not apply to generation. Would there be anyone available in DC to do a formatting pass either late tonight your time or early a.m. Wed?  (Don't start such a process with out checking Mary or I, however.) 
See attached. 
Here's the pleading that will accompany Alan's affidavit.  We plan, at this point, to send a cover letter with this saying that we will be sending our responses to Hoecker's questions on Tuesday.  We need this additional time to get the input of our commercial people. 
I will be sending to changes to Ron's draft as I write them.   Here's the first one: Under the bullet about the soft cap, cross out the language saying ""At a minimum the Commission should raise the cap to $250 per MWh,"" and insert: ""As detailed in the attached analyses, price caps only interfere with the price signals so necessary to the proper functioniung of the California markets. Nonetheless, if the Comission accepts a price cap, the $150 level is too low and the Commission must determine a level that will ensure the recovery of costs and give market participants the proper incentives to participate in 
Finish off the soft cap paragraph by saying that: The Commission should also establish a 15-month sunset period on the price cap and any reporting requirement and refund obligation, subject to an affirmative Commission finding that futher market intervention is necessary.

I. Market Design A. Delete the clause beginning ""at a minimum ...."" from the title. 
This is my last edit. I.    Market Designs B. Paragraph 3 - Should be rewritten as follows: In sum, the Commission's proposal for a soft cap, combined with the complex nature of the reporting requirement and refund potential has introduced substantial uncertainty in the market and therefore substantial risk of and disincentive to do business in the California market.  To ensure participation, the Commission needs to create clear, uncomplicated review standards.  In addition, if the Commission insists on a cap it must at a minimum establish a higher hard price cap and provide that the refund obligation will not be applicable to sales below that level.  Such a safe harbor is required to prevent disincentives to the development of new generation and to ensure liquidity and reliability in the California market. 
I. Market Design A. Delete the clause beginning ""at a minimum ...."" from the title. 
The CPUC has protested the ISO's recent replacement of Volume Nos. I and II of its tariff.  The ISO's tariff filing does not propose changes to any substantive provision and is intended to be an uncontroversial filing to comply with the designation and formatting requirements of FERC's Order 614. Nevertheless, the CPUC: Asks FERC to reject and modify the confidentiality and disclosure provisions of the tariff such that they do not apply to requests for information from California state agencies with statutory responsibilities related to regulation or oversight of the electric industry.  CPUC asks the provisions be modified to require the ISO to respond to such requests in the same manner as it responds to data requests from FERC itself. Points out that the ISO has used this provision to refuse to provide responses to the CPUC's subpoena including bid data. Also asserts that the Western System Coordinating Council's (WSCC) extra high voltage (EHV) data is available in real time to all WSCC members, including market participants. I was wondering if others agree we should file an answer to the CPUC's answer, stating the following. The ISO should make all market information available to all market participants as we laid out in our comments on the FERC's November 1 order. Not all market participants get EHV data - since [date?] the ISO has refused to provide this information to the WSCC unless the WSCC keeps this information confidential, due to its tariff's confidentiality provisions. Accordingly the ISO's data is now only being provided to those market participants with control areas. However, we have no way of knowing, and therefore assume that utilities, munis, and Federal Power Marketing Administrations with control areas are providing this information to their merchant function.  This access to market information is unduly discriminatory.  To rectify this undue discrimination, the FERC should delete the confidentiality provision altogether. The CPUC's filing is procedurally defective in that the ISO did not change the confidentiality provision of its tariff so the CPUC's filing should have been in a complaint in which it would have the burden of proof.  Therefore,

Are you proposing to have a conference call on this?  Alan, remember we talked to Tim about meeting with the traders about this - what is the status of that? Here are my comments.  In general, I don't think we should refer to WPTF arguments where we have made our own arguments, in particular on number 5. We should summarize EES/EPMI's arguments as I did in my proposed draft answer to this question.  With respect to answers to questions 2 and 4,  I think we should make more legally-oriented arguments essentially restating the arguments we made in EES/EPMI's comments to FERC, along the lines of my proposed draft answers.  Although the Commissioners will not read our pleadings, they are likely to read our answers to these questions so this will give us an opportunity to summarize our pleadings.  In addition, these are positions that we have already agreed to and discussed.  For those of you who don't have my suggested draft answers, they are attached. Susan J Mara@ENRON 11/28/2000 10:43 PM 
Here's a short but sweet draft.  Alan will be providing data and Ron will be providing some additional language on question 5 (or whichever one talks about J&R rates).  We're also still trying to get the chart referred to in Question 2 -- so for now we have no answer for that one. I'm in the office Wed but in a few meetings.  Call or e-mail comments.  415 782-7802

California Consumer Group Submits Electricity Reregulation Ballot Initiative Nov. 28, 2000 Dow Jones Online News (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -- A California consumer group submitted a draft ballot initiative to the governor and state legislature Tuesday, calling for a publicly owned and controlled electricity system. The Foundation For Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called for the creation of a state power authority that would build and operate power plants, transmission and distribution facilities. It also advocated the oversight of electricity rates by the state Public Utilities Commission, and the issuance of refunds to San Diego customers who were hit with large bills this summer when they were exposed to full market rates. The consumer group filed papers Tuesday with the Secretary of State to establish a campaign committee called the Campaign for the Protection of Ratepayers, which would sponsor the 2002 ballot measure, FTCR announced at a press conference Tuesday. Refunds should be issued to customers of Sempra (SRE) unit San Diego Gas and Electric Co. via a ""windfall profits tax"" on power companies that sold energy at unjust and unreasonable prices, according to the FTCR draft. The PUC should be authorized to establish the thresholds for excessive energy prices that would be used in determining the tax. It should also be able to oversee the issuance of refunds, as well as electric rates on a cost-of-service basis, the FTCR said. At the same time, the PUC should be restructured so its commissioners are more publicly accountable. A Citizen Utility Board should also be created to protect consumer interests, the FTCR said. The FTCR also advocated that a separate state agency be created that could build, own, operate and buy power plants and transmission and distribution assets. That agency could auction the right to build plants to, or contract with, private generators that would sell energy to utilities on a cost-of-service basis. As well, the FTCR recommended giving authority to state and local governments to take over generation, transmission and distribution assets if necessary. No specifics were given in the draft on what would necessitate such a takeover. FTCR stressed that Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PGE) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co. shouldn't be permitted to back bill customers for the unexpectedly high cost of buying wholesale power this summer. The two utilities have filed lawsuits against the PUC for authority to recover those costs, as they are unable to do so while their customers are under a state-mandated rate freeze. ""Any effort to force the ratepayers to pay even one cent more to cover the greed and stupidity of the utility companies in this disaster of their own making will conclude our participation in the legislative process,"" said FTCR president Harvey Rosenfield. Mr. Rosenfield questioned how the utilities could claim they are having financial difficulties when they donated $1.2 million to lawmakers and lobbyists in this year's third quarter, and called for a moratorium on power company campaign contributions. ""We urge elected officials to cease accepting money from any of the interested utility and power companies ... while the deliberations are underway. To fail to do so will cause the public to doubt the integrity of the legislative process,"" Rosenfield said. Mr. Rosenfield also said his group would ""not participate in any behind-closed-doors legislative negotiations or discussions,"" saying that the 1996 deregulation law was ""the product of a three-week legislative ramrod featuring back-room meetings, late-night hearings, payoffs

I would not convert footnotes to endnotes- quick review: looks very good. I will review in more detail over weekend. Thanks. 
I'm forwarding a notice from the California ISO, telling us it will be responding to a very broad Subpoena from the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB).  Many of the questions relate to the period of from September 2000 through November 2000.  The ISO indicates that it will be answering the requests because the EOB has granted what it believes is an adequate protective order.  This order agrees to keep the answers to certain questions confidential, but to provide them to the CPUC and the AG if they agree to keep them confidential.  If we have concerns about the confidential order we are supposed to advise the ISO by Monday 12/1, at 9:00 a.m.  The subpoeana, and confidential order, and a letter explaining the treatment of the various requests are attached. I am assuming that because the order appears to protect our commercial interests, we will not protest this.  Richard - let me know if you want to have a conference call on this and I'll have Lysa set one up. 
Given the importance of this document to the traders and given that the FERC may be considering a number of these dockets at its December 13th meeting and given that the agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, I would wait until the agenda is posted to update and forward to the traders.  The FERC's agenda is posted at: www.ferc.fec.us/public/isd/sunshine/htm 
Based on what we heard from FERC last week, we should: Be taking a leadership role in either EPSA, WPTF, our whichever entity thinks most like Enron and has the largest number of members. Decide the five most important issues we want FERC to address and try to work on these issues through that group. I think Joe should be spearheading this effort. Accordingly, I think it is most appropriate to work on things like responding to the Joskow/Hogan papers through that group. 
It's our understanding that the FERC will now be considerting at a Friday meeting its order on the California invetsigation.  Lysa Akin is setting up an audio connection.  Lysa, please contact Dennis, Jubron and Neil about this. 
Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today: How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price? I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Hall's summary.  There's some=20 redundancy but hopefully, this provides a few more details.    Also, Mary H= .=20 and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to= =20 approve the ISO=01,s request in full. Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing): The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO. 1) ISO=01,s $250/MWh Soft Cap a) Summarized: ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so= ft=20 cap but raises the soft cap level to $250 from the $150/MWh proposed by the= =20 FERC: =01&The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi= th an=20 interim =01&soft=018 price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th= e=20 Commission=01,s November 1 Order. The ISO=01,s scheduling system will not r= eject=20 Energy bids priced in excess of the $250/MWh price cap, but will evaluate= =20 those bids in price merit order. However, if the ISO issues Dispatch=20 instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in=20 excess of the $250 soft cap, those bids will not set the Market Clearing=20 Price for Imbalance Energy. Rather, those Scheduling Coordinators will be= =20 paid in accordance with their bids.=018 b) Refund risk and cost documentation above $250. =01&Imbalance Energy abov= e the=20 level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund, based on subsequent= =20 review by the Commission. It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th= at=20 submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission, a= s=20 well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha= t=20 they may bring questionable bids to the Commission=01,s attention. i) Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental= =20 to what was requested by the FERC. See p. 8 ii) Regarding production costs:  fuel, taxes, emission credits, startup cos= ts=20 are all listed as costs.  However, no mention of noncontiguous scheduling= =20 costs or reasonable profit. iii) Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs:  In a footnote to cover letter= ,=20 ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess = of=20 10% of the production costs or $25/MWh, whichever is lesser. c) Useful quote: =01&In light of current fuel prices and the ISO=01,s recen= t=20 experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at= =20 prices of $150 or less in many hours, the ISO believes that a $150 soft cap= =20 would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an as-bid basis.= =018 d) Effective date: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00.=20 e) Term of this soft cap:  lesser of 3 mo (3/8/01) or whenever the Commissi= on=20 supercedes it by its own order. f) Applicable tariff sections.  Section 2.5.23.2 and .3.  See attachments= =20 A1/B1 to the filing. 2) Participating Generator Penalties a) Summary: =01&the ISO proposes in Amendment No. 33 to assess penalties ag= ainst=20 Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO=20 Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to= =20 avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency. They would be charged an= =20 amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea= ch=20 hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond. In addition, i= f,=20 during that hour, the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other= =20 than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as=20 interruptible, the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty = of=20 $1000/MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver.=018 b) Allowed excuse:  The penalties would not apply if the Participating=20 Generator has notified the ISO (within the hour of instruction), and=20 subsequently demonstrates (documentation within 72 hours) , that its=20 Generating Unit, System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to=20 operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not = be=20 waived. c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of 5.6.1 .2 and .3. See=20 attachments A2/B2 to the filing. d) Effective date: Same as the ISO=01,s new soft cap: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00 e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision. 3) Load Imbalance Penalties a) Summary: =01&Scheduling Coordinators who rely on that  market to serve t= heir=20 Loads the ISO=01,s costs of obtaining Energy through bids above the propose= d=20 soft price cap or through out-of-market Dispatches when bids are=20 insufficient.

San Diego Gas & Electric Company's filing for emergency relief asked FERC to re-impose price caps for short-term releases of capacity for service to the California border and to points of interconnection between interstate pipelines and California LDCs, and provide that sellers be required to state separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate 
We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments? 
Yes we do care.  The question is: are we going to do anything?  Robin and Richard will be discussing this this afternoon. The CPUC's motion only applied to the generators, not the ISO.  I guess the ISO was viewed as cooperating. Susan J Mara@ENRON 12/13/2000 09:56 AM 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas -- FOR YOUR INFORMATION The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a court tells them not to.  DO we care about this? Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC-- given the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info? Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC claims identify those who have abused market power. 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO Tariff section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly, the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20 unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4 which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in the past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an outage and projected in service date since this information could be used by Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current requests.

The ISO filed a response at FERC to the PX's request to remove the hard cap= =20 on adjustment bids and=20 replace it with a floating cap that would track the price of energy in the= =20 market. =20 The ISO opposes the proposal arguing that it may produce extremely high=20 constrained Zonal market clearing=20 prices in the forward markets and may be subject to the exercise of market= =20 power and to gaming. =20 The ISO suggests the PX fix this by anchoring its Adjustment Bids=20 (incremental and  decremental bids) prices=20 to the unconstrained market clearing price, as opposed to absolute Energy= =20 bids.  In other words, the PX would=20 establish its constrained market clearing price as the sum of the=20 unconstrained market clearing price and the=20 Usage Charge resulting from the ISO=01,s Congestion Management process. =20 To effectuate this change, the PX would have to impose a new rule that=20 Adjustment Bids be within $125 of the=20 unconstrained market clearing price. The PX would then be required to proce= ss=20 the Adjustment Bids prior to=20 passing them on to the ISO. The PX would have to subtract the unconstrained= =20 market clearing price from each=20 Adjustment Bid prior to submitting it to the ISO. The ISO would then utiliz= e=20 these Adjustment Bids, as well as=20 those submitted by other Scheduling Coordinators, to run its Congestion=20 Management system. After the ISO=20 completes its  Congestion Management process, the ISO would then=20 ""post-process"" the Adjustment Bids=20 (add back the unconstrained market clearing price) for use by the PX in=20 establishing its constrained Zonal=20 Energy prices and, as needed, by the ISO in real-time Congestion Management= .=20 The ISO says it does not intend, by presenting this alternative to the PX= =01,s=20 proposal, to preclude consideration=20 of other solutions that may be presented by one or more of the utilities or= =20 by the EOB. =20 The ISO also argued that the Commission should impose reporting requirement= s=20 on those entities who submit=20 Adjustment Bids in the ISO=01,s Congestion Management process.  It recommen= ds=20 that the Commission require=20 the submission of all Adjustment Bids to the Commission, the ISO and the=20 EOB.  It also asked the Commission=20 to direct the PX Market Monitoring Unit, in concert with the ISO=01,s Depar= tment=20 of Market Analysis, to increase its=20 monitoring of Adjustment Bids and bids submitted in the PX forward Energy= =20 markets for evidence of the=20 exercise of market power. The ISO argues that the effect of the FERC's December 8 Order on supply=20 sufficiency in the ISO=01,s real time=20 Imbalance Energy market was immediate and beneficial.  It states the=20 following in support.  Although supply=20 in California is still very tight, after implementation of Amendment No. 33= ,=20 there were bids available in the ISO=01,s=20 ""BEEP Stack"" to address California=01,s real time balancing needs for the f= irst=20 time in nearly a week. Immediately=20 after the order was issued 3000 to 5000 MW of Generation internal to=20 California and up to an additional 1990 MW=20 of imports became available to the ISO.

We have put together the following list of issues for the request for rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001. We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit $150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?) Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts. The FERC should clarify its statement that ""to the extent the IOUs' resources exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules.""  A literal interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options but we are concerned about less liquidity. Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs. We oppose the 27-month refund period We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF) The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being 
What WSJ data request? Jeff Dasovich@EES 08/29/2000 08:31 AM 
I have received several comments about the WSJ data request. Enron's Tim Beldon wrote me that he would consider it.  The PX's Gene Waas was concerned based on previous experiences of letting data go to the WSJ.  I talked with Dynegy's Lynn Lednicky this morning and he suggested that the PX has aggregated data for several days, and that releasing the aggregate data with individual bid data from our members would give the WSJ a better window into the issues.  That is, simply releasing your bid data will not tell the WSJ anything of value. I know that Rebecca would insist that the dates for which any data are polled our at her choice, not ours.  It must be necessary to assure there is no possibility of bias.  I am wondering if the PX would be willing to assist us by putting together aggregate data for days which the WSJ selects, and then give us the opportunity to release our individual data for the same days? I am also wondering if we shouldn't have an off-the-record teleconference call with the WSJ whereby both sides can get a better understanding of what the WSJ wants, and how we can best provide it. Would anyone be interested in me setting up such a meeting for next week, say Wednesday or Thursday? gba

Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points: There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well. High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt. The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme. The market would function better if more information was provided to the market. The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load. To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, you will find there are many ""hidden"" slides that were not part of the oral presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional information. According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is looking into the data we provided. I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of scarcity . (See attached file: August 24 presentation to FERC1.ppt)(See attached file: FERC Presentation.ppt) - August 24 presentation to FERC1.ppt 
Sounds like a good idea to me.  Steve Walton and I have been involved in the NW negotiations.  I'd be happy to go to FERC to talk to Alice, Rob, and Mike. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
I think that would be useful. Jeff Dasovich@EES 08/30/2000 11:25 AM 
Jim has mentioned a meeting next week with all of us to talk about strategy, etc. over the next many months.  Might be a good opportunity to clarify how we coordinate on these matters. ""Mary Hain"" <Mary.Hain@enron.com> on 08/30/2000 12:43:58 PM 
In general, please contact me before you call on Sarah, Joe and Donna with FERC issues.  I was aware of this filing and have been talking to the traders about whether we want to do anything about it.  Thanks! Sarah Novosel@ENRON 08/30/2000 07:57 AM 
See the email from Donna Fulton below.  Donna joined Government Affairs a couple of months ago.  She was with Enron - GPG for 12 years doing gas regulatory work, so she's an expert in FERC matters but is getting up to speed on electric matters.  Please feel free to call her in addition to Joe or me on FERC regulatory matters. Also, the Cal PX filed at FERC on August 22 its proposal to implement a $350 price cap.  Interventions are due on September 12.  A copy of the filing (Imaging Format) and FERC's notice are attached. We should discuss what position we want to take, if any, in response to the Cal PX's filing. Sarah (See attached file: Cal PX $350)(See attached file: Cal PX Notice) 
FYI - Attached is the FERC notice of Cal ISO's filing to implement ten-minute markets effective September 1, 2000.  Do you think there is any interest in our participation/intervention? (See attached file: ER002383.00B.TXT) - Cal PX $350 - Cal PX Notice - ER002383.00B.TXT 
I'd like to propose a conference call to discuss our response to multiple FERC cases detailed below. Section 206 Proceeding and SDG&E Complaint Case As you know, last week the FERC established a  Section 206 proceeding to examine the justness and reasonableness of the rates of power sellers (including EPMI) in the California markets.  The Commission consolidated this proceeding with its case involving the SDG&E's complaint against the power marketers (including EPMI) in California.  This type of proceeding differs from the Staff's investigation of the wholesale market in several respects. (1) It establishes a formal evidentiary process where all parties have an opportunity to present evidence and arguments on the record before the Commission.  In Section 206 proceedings, the FERC usually establishes a discovery and testimony schedule followed by a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).  Such proceedings usually take a long time. The Commission did not establish a schedule here, suggesting that it either would decide the case via a paper hearing or prompt its staff to try to settle the case.  The Commission may wish to act by paper hearing to obviate the slow procedural schedules that usually result from using an ALJ or, as is often the case with California, the FERC may wish to avoid the political backlash that might result from issuing a controversial order by letting parties fight the case out at the bargaining table after the Staff does its discovery and recommends an outcome to the parties. (2) Although the Commission equivocated on whether it would use refund authority, it established a refund date of sixty days from the date the order is published in the federal register.  This was apparently because Commissioner Hebert wrote a concurrence indicating his opposition to instituting a refund obligation that might predate the FERC's conclusion of its investigation (because it would prohibit wholesale providers from knowing what rates they will be able to recover). Ron Carroll has now raised the question of whether we should request rehearing of the FERC's order, challenging the Commission's authority to impose a refund effective date on the basis that no defendant has requested a refund. Cal PX Price Cap Filing As you also know, the California PX has filed to decrease its price cap to $350. Electricity Oversight Board Complaint Yesterday, the Electricity Oversight Board's (EOB) filed a complaint with FERC against ""sellers"" (including munis, federal power marketers and ""sellers located beyond the border of the United States"" (in other words PowerEx)) and scheduling coordinators that sell into the California wholesale market.  It urges FERC to find that the California wholesale market is not workably competitive.  It alleges that scheduling coordinators are particularly well positioned to take advantage of ""gaming"" opportunities because they often bid on behalf of more than one seller - undermining the benefits of divestiture. It alleges that sellers and SCs can exercise market power under two circumstances: 1. When all sellers and scheduling coordinators know with substantial certainty that the ISO will be accepting all bids or 2. When a number of sellers and scheduling coordinators know that they control enough capacity in relation to the system demand at that time and the resulting margin of residual supply that they have a high likelihood of being able to successfully set the price. It claims that once demand reaches or exceeds approximately 33,000 MW, sellers and/or scheduling coordinators have the ability, and do, exercise market power and that a bid cap is necessary during these periods.  It urges FERC to take immediate steps to lower prices and ensure the bid caps (of $250 for energy and ancillary services and $100 for replacement reserves) remain in effect pending FERC action.  EOB is concerned that if the FERC doesn't require continuation of price caps, the ISO could undo its price cap vote at any time.  It asks FERC to take any and all actions necessary to ensure that California's wholesale rates are just and reasonable.  Its asks to consolidate its filing into the FERC's section 206 proceeding.  Assuming the FERC consolidates this cases, which I'm sure it will, this would create a defendant for refund purposes so I think Ron's rehearing idea has been overtaken by events. However, we need to decide what entities should make what filings in reference to the above.  I recommend the following: EPMI doesn't need to intervene in the Section 206 proceeding because the FERC combined it with the SDG&E case so EPMI is already a party.  I think we should use Seabron  to develop a detailed analysis of problems with the California market and to draft responses to the data requests that we will undoubtedly be receiving soon from FERC.  This analysis should include the points we presented to FERC but should also include all other important problems with the California wholesale market. We are parties of right in the Electricity Oversight Board's case because we are respondents and as such we are required to file an answer under the Commission's rules.  I think we should agree that the FERC should consolidate this case with the Section 206 case because they are obviously the same case.  We should oppose price caps in California and lay out the same arguments we made in our presentation to FERC.  We also need to refute the contention that capping the PX price will encourage energy sales to move into the forward market.  We will also need to develop an analysis of how we can't exercise market power under the circumstances alleged by the EOB.  We should use Seabron for this. Although it would be convenient to work with EPSA in these dockets, I'm not sure that will work since I bet the FERC will combine these cases and will be seeking discovery individually from EPMI.  On the other hand, we may wish to use EPSA for any of the less popular messages that we may want to deliver about the market in California. 
Attached find a draft of Seabron and Carl's white paper in the Section 206 proceeding with my suggested revisions and comments in redline and strikeout.  I think they did an excellent job.  I have also attached a short (but detailed) outline of the white paper for those of you who don't have time to read the white paper.  If you have any comments on this please get them to me ASAP as I would like to file this paper at FERC on Friday.  Ron Carroll is drafting a pleading to accompany it to FERC. A couple of general comments for Seabron and Carl: I did not move it but the section on information and governance should be moved to the beginning of the paper as these are the most important problems to Enron. It's not always clear whether you are referring to the FERC doing something or the PUC. You may want to add some of the recommendations and observations that the PX made in its recent analysis of price activity: May - July 2000. 
For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan. 
We have put together the following list of issues for the request for rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001. We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit $150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?) Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts. The FERC should clarify its statement that ""to the extent the IOUs' resources exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules.""  A literal interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options but we are concerned about less liquidity. Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs. We oppose the 27-month refund period We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF) The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being

The Cal ISO, Williams, AES Corporation, Southern, and Reliant moved that the CPUC modify its protective order.  People are protesting the fact that they have to file their answers before resolution of multiple issues over the protective order.  Williams is threatening to file a motion to quash.  It says ""to the extent the CPUC is conducting a valid investigation within jurisdictional bounds, Williams will cooperate.""  Richard you may want to call their attorney Alex Goldberg to get the details, if you haven't already

Seabron has agreed to write a brief sumary of the Section 206 white paper, in 
Tim gave some final comments to Seab this morning and is getting together some data for him.  Tim will provide the data shortly (today).  Then the paper will be ready for filing.    So please get any other comments to me NOW.  Thanks. 
This paper will be filed at FERC tomorrow.  Here's a copy for you file.  Ron will send us the final version of the cover motion tomorrow. 
I called my friend at FERC.  She said she is working on the report.  She said Staff's biggest problem was all of the requests for confidentiality - that's all she could say.  She asked me to E-mail the white paper directly to her, 
The attached bullets give real-life examples that people will understand.  I also told Karen Denne to reference the bullets at the beginning of our motion if she needs to know what we're requesting at FERC.  Please notify Karen and me if you see any problems with the message. 
I asked Seabron to outline the points to be made in the answer to CMUA pleading.  I took the filing seriously because I think it's pretty well 
FYI Press Release California ISO Offers Market Stabilization Proposal Calls for Forum for Reaching Consensus on Market Power Mitigation FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 20, 2000--Hoping to trigger consensus building that will lead to solutions to volatile energy prices, the California Independent System Operator (California ISO) filed a Market Stabilization Proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today, Friday, Oct. 20, 2000. The plan was unveiled during a news conference at the ISO's Folsom Control Center this morning. California ISO CEO Terry Winter described the plan as a discussion platform -- a document not etched in stone but rather introduced as a means for putting the brakes on market prices and finding long-term solutions that will protect consumers from high bills while stimulating new investment in power plants. The California ISO is asking FERC to consider the following regulatory steps: Institute Payment Cap of $100 in all markets with the following exemptions: Generators that can prove they will lose money if capped on that rate Generators that contract 70 percent of their supply to serve California customers Renewable generation -- Generation facilities less than 50 megawatts -- New power plants -- Imported power The existing $250 per megawatt hour price cap would still exist and serve as the absolute price ceiling for suppliers exempt from the $100 payment cap. ``We cannot simply apply a short-term patch for market power, without also addressing the underlying problems causing sky-high prices,'' said California ISO CEO Terry Winter. ``Consumers have little control over how they can respond to high prices. There are traffic jams on the transmission systems that keep us from moving electricity efficiently around the state, not to mention the fact there are not enough megawatts to meet the needs of consumers. And, the lack of forward contracting scheduling means the California ISO is making up for huge shortfalls ten minutes before the power is consumed.'' Along with providing the incentive for generators (sellers) to sign formal contracts, the California ISO also recommends requiring utilities (buyers) to contract for 85 percent of their customer requirement for power in advance of when it's needed. The lack of adequate forward contracting also adds to an operational problem facing the ISO -- the fact that 20-30 percent of total consumption is frequently bought and sold in the ISO's Real-Time Market, which was designed to handle only five percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets. This problem -- known as under-scheduling -- is also addressed in the ISO's filing by a real-time trading charge. ``Because of the visibility of the ISO's markets -- the fact that we are so public -- and as a result of the distortion of the intended market design, the ISO has been called upon to take on responsibilities it was never intended to handle,'' said Winter. ``This proposal would take the ISO back to its original mission of operating the markets of last resort, allowing ISO operators to focus on maintaining reliability of the power grid.'' The California ISO is chartered by the state to manage the flow of electricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission systems. The not-for-profit public benefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March 1998 when California opened its energy markets to competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over the California ISO to manage. The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity and ensure equal access to an open-market electron highway that spans 12,500 circuit miles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Contact: California ISO Patrick Dorinson, 888/516-NEWS 
Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points: There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well. High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt. The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme. The market would function better if more information was provided to the market. The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load. To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, you will find there are many ""hidden"" slides that were not part of the oral presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional information. According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is looking into the data we provided. I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of scarcity . (See attached file: August 24 presentation to FERC1.ppt)(See attached file: FERC Presentation.ppt) - August 24 presentation to FERC1.ppt

Karen - thanks for getting the word out! PowerPlus ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Seeking to eliminate price caps as solution Enron Pushes Four-Point Fix To CA Wholesale Power Market Broad-scale power marketer Enron, on the eve of the release of a proposed FERC remedy, has delivered a four-point plan of its own to remedy structural problems in the California wholesale power market. Observers say that the power marketer is seeking to push FERC into preempting state rules with structural changes for the California market, rather than continue reliance on price caps and other bidding controls as an interim solution to nascent wholesale power markets. In a white paper submitted to the commission for consideration, Enron tells the commissioners that the ""problem in California is not that competition cannot work but that it has not been given a chance to work because the existing structure of the 
Tom and Cynthia you are cordially invited. 
details for the conference call referenced below are as follows: 
Jim Steffes suggested that we develop message points in anticipation of FERC's ruling on November 1. In this regard, we could:  (1) use the Seabron Adamson paper as our central message; and (2)develop separate messages for a variety of FERC outcomes--e.g., cost-based rates or additional rate caps. To that end, we are scheduling a conference call at 11:00 A.M. (PST) this Friday, October 27. Lysa:  please contact folks on the above-list to see if they are available. Assuming we can reach critical mass for the call, forward AT&T conference calling information to the above-list. 
See the attached short memo from Seabron before our conference call tomorrow.  Seabron has now read the motions/settlement proposals made last week by the CPUC, the Cal ISO CEO, PG&E SCE and TURN, and SDG&E.  Out of all the pleadings, he concludes that only SDG&E raises a new economics issue that we would need to rebut: SDG&E challenges our assertion that requiring utilities to be in the forward market will solve the problem in the California market.   SDG&E also makes a number of policy recommendations that we have not yet addressed in the context of the FERC's investigation that we must oppose because the traders oppose them. Ron Carroll is currently drafting a FERC filing/letter telling FERC that we will not be answering these pleadings within the typical 15 days for filings answers but will instead be addressing these filings in the context of the FERC's November 1 order and assume that by doing so we are not waiving any rights.  That way we can file one pleading rather than many. - 00-10-26 SA Memo on SDG&E response.doc 
One other argument we could make:  according to the traders, the gas market is very liquid.  Because the gas market is very liquid, generators will sell their gas and turn off their units.  So the ISO will create a reliability problem. 
Some comments from Tim on the outline Because the prices are based on L3Day NYMEX prices, when two out of three prices have already been posted, it is impossible for parties to hedge their risk for November.  [For your information but not for the filing - We have a big position for November so we need to get this pushed off until December or we could lose alot of money]. By basing the caps on heat rates from 1999, the ISO assumed that this was the proper test period.  This is not a good test year given that generators lost alot of money in 1999. 
Attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the CPUC's proposal for load based price caps.  Obviously, these arguments would also apply to the ISO Board's recent decision. 
Sounds like a good idea to me.  Steve Walton and I have been involved in the NW negotiations.  I'd be happy to go to FERC to talk to Alice, Rob, and Mike. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

In general, please contact me before you call on Sarah, Joe and Donna with FERC issues.  I was aware of this filing and have been talking to the traders about whether we want to do anything about it.  Thanks! Sarah Novosel@ENRON 08/30/2000 07:57 AM 
See the email from Donna Fulton below.  Donna joined Government Affairs a couple of months ago.  She was with Enron - GPG for 12 years doing gas regulatory work, so she's an expert in FERC matters but is getting up to speed on electric matters.  Please feel free to call her in addition to Joe or me on FERC regulatory matters. Also, the Cal PX filed at FERC on August 22 its proposal to implement a $350 price cap.  Interventions are due on September 12.  A copy of the filing (Imaging Format) and FERC's notice are attached. We should discuss what position we want to take, if any, in response to the Cal PX's filing. Sarah (See attached file: Cal PX $350)(See attached file: Cal PX Notice) 
FYI - Attached is the FERC notice of Cal ISO's filing to implement ten-minute markets effective September 1, 2000.  Do you think there is any interest in our participation/intervention? (See attached file: ER002383.00B.TXT) - Cal PX $350 - Cal PX Notice - ER002383.00B.TXT 
I have no idea.  It sounds like a state regulatory thing.  Maybe someone in the California office knows. 
do you know what the 394.5 notice is that he is talking about? 
It looks fine to me.  Does anyone else have any comments? 
I'd like to propose a conference call to discuss our response to multiple FERC cases detailed below. Section 206 Proceeding and SDG&E Complaint Case As you know, last week the FERC established a  Section 206 proceeding to examine the justness and reasonableness of the rates of power sellers (including EPMI) in the California markets.  The Commission consolidated this proceeding with its case involving the SDG&E's complaint against the power marketers (including EPMI) in California.  This type of proceeding differs from the Staff's investigation of the wholesale market in several respects. (1) It establishes a formal evidentiary process where all parties have an opportunity to present evidence and arguments on the record before the Commission.  In Section 206 proceedings, the FERC usually establishes a discovery and testimony schedule followed by a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).  Such proceedings usually take a long time. The Commission did not establish a schedule here, suggesting that it either would decide the case via a paper hearing or prompt its staff to try to settle the case.  The Commission may wish to act by paper hearing to obviate the slow procedural schedules that usually result from using an ALJ or, as is often the case with California, the FERC may wish to avoid the political backlash that might result from issuing a controversial order by letting parties fight the case out at the bargaining table after the Staff does its discovery and recommends an outcome to the parties. (2) Although the Commission equivocated on whether it would use refund authority, it established a refund date of sixty days from the date the order is published in the federal register.  This was apparently because Commissioner Hebert wrote a concurrence indicating his opposition to instituting a refund obligation that might predate the FERC's conclusion of its investigation (because it would prohibit wholesale providers from knowing what rates they will be able to recover). Ron Carroll has now raised the question of whether we should request rehearing of the FERC's order, challenging the Commission's authority to impose a refund effective date on the basis that no defendant has requested a refund. Cal PX Price Cap Filing As you also know, the California PX has filed to decrease its price cap to $350. Electricity Oversight Board Complaint Yesterday, the Electricity Oversight Board's (EOB) filed a complaint with FERC against ""sellers"" (including munis, federal power marketers and ""sellers located beyond the border of the United States"" (in other words PowerEx)) and scheduling coordinators that sell into the California wholesale market.  It urges FERC to find that the California wholesale market is not workably competitive.  It alleges that scheduling coordinators are particularly well positioned to take advantage of ""gaming"" opportunities because they often bid on behalf of more than one seller - undermining the benefits of divestiture. It alleges that sellers and SCs can exercise market power under two circumstances: 1. When all sellers and scheduling coordinators know with substantial certainty that the ISO will be accepting all bids or 2. When a number of sellers and scheduling coordinators know that they control enough capacity in relation to the system demand at that time and the resulting margin of residual supply that they have a high likelihood of being able to successfully set the price. It claims that once demand reaches or exceeds approximately 33,000 MW, sellers and/or scheduling coordinators have the ability, and do, exercise market power and that a bid cap is necessary during these periods.  It urges FERC to take immediate steps to lower prices and ensure the bid caps (of $250 for energy and ancillary services and $100 for replacement reserves) remain in effect pending FERC action.  EOB is concerned that if the FERC doesn't require continuation of price caps, the ISO could undo its price cap vote at any time.  It asks FERC to take any and all actions necessary to ensure that California's wholesale rates are just and reasonable.  Its asks to consolidate its filing into the FERC's section 206 proceeding.  Assuming the FERC consolidates this cases, which I'm sure it will, this would create a defendant for refund purposes so I think Ron's rehearing idea has been overtaken by events. However, we need to decide what entities should make what filings in reference to the above.  I recommend the following: EPMI doesn't need to intervene in the Section 206 proceeding because the FERC combined it with the SDG&E case so EPMI is already a party.  I think we should use Seabron  to develop a detailed analysis of problems with the California market and to draft responses to the data requests that we will undoubtedly be receiving soon from FERC.  This analysis should include the points we presented to FERC but should also include all other important problems with the California wholesale market. We are parties of right in the Electricity Oversight Board's case because we are respondents and as such we are required to file an answer under the Commission's rules.  I think we should agree that the FERC should consolidate this case with the Section 206 case because they are obviously the same case.  We should oppose price caps in California and lay out the same arguments we made in our presentation to FERC.  We also need to refute the contention that capping the PX price will encourage energy sales to move into the forward market.  We will also need to develop an analysis of how we can't exercise market power under the circumstances alleged by the EOB.  We should use Seabron for this. Although it would be convenient to work with EPSA in these dockets, I'm not sure that will work since I bet the FERC will combine these cases and will be seeking discovery individually from EPMI.  On the other hand, we may wish to use EPSA for any of the less popular messages that we may want to deliver about the market in California. 
In response to Jim's E-mail  - here's is my proposed list of issues for Enron's November 9 comments.  We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow so please comment on this ASAP. We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information Here's my rationale.  Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market information to market participants.  We could summarize the positions we took in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at all and why we need information.  In addition, we should assume that they will adopt price caps anyway and may reaffirm their own proposal, so we should also tell them how the $150 cap will be too low to incent investment in new generation, how the reporting requirement will create special problems for power marketers  (we don't have marginal costs and the Commission has yet to determine what opportunity costs are), and how they still have not addressed the problems created by OOM. In addition, although I don't think we need to tell FERC this, our comments could briefly congratulate the Commission for removing the buy/sell requirement, addressing underscheduling of load, creating independent governance and directing the ISO to file generation interconnection procedures.  Although our written comments will probably want to discuss any clarifications of this measures as well as the long term measures the Commission discussed (reserve requirements, alternate auction mechanisms, balanced schedules, enhanced market mitigation, congestion management redesign, demand response programs, RTO development and compliance) our oral comment time is too precious to use on these issues.  In addition, our written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's decision to move the refund effective date.  I'm sure we'll find more issues 
In answer to your first point, the FERC did exempt demand side bids from the $150.  See footnote No. 84 of the order. Susan J Mara@ENRON 11/02/2000 01:50 PM 
Gang, I didn't get Jim's e-mail but .....  Here are my comments This looks good as a bottomline message, but I'd like to dress it up and take it out on a date first (doesn't dasovich talk like this?) I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS this summer.  To the contrary, in the west, we were working with some customers (a  few hundred MWs)  to participate in the ISO's program -- after the Board voted to lower the cap to $250 -- the customers all said sayonara -- could no longer justify the expense and the interference in their operations.  These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail demand response. This only goes so far, however... The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids from the price caps.  SO, we need more... I think we should focus on the practical effects of a ""soft"" cap (not simple

We have discovered another problem that we may want to discuss in our oral comments, although the UDCs may cover it.  Even though the FERC removes the forward market prohibition, the UDCs will not be in the forward market because: (1) the PUC may find they were imprudent and (2) the FERC's penalty is only for underscheduling load in the day-ahead or the day-of market, not 
Please add Alan to all of your E-mails about California. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is refusing to sell outside of California for less than $250.  This is diminishing liquidity in the market. However, we can't call FERC and complain because munis are not regulated by FERC.  Here is an example of something we should be bringing to NW 
All I know is they say it to our traders.  The rationale is to keep power in California. 
Mary, For two months now,   the Real Time traders at LADWP say that they either: Cannot buy or sale anything due to political concerns Or Cannot sell for less than $225 due to political reasons. They have not provided any detail behind this decision.    Other market participants,  such as SRP,  Pacificorp and APS  are aware of their policy. We have heard that the price could be less if you are a utility buyer, however,   we have nothing to substantiate this information. JMF 
Here are the FERC presentations.  The first one is Tim's.  It corrects some information in my presentation.  For example, Tim's presentation corrects the hydro generation numbers to reflect the fact that not all hydro capacity equates with hydro energy, if there isn't sufficient water to produce it.  My presentation includes more verbal explanations.  Cooper and Alan - does any of the data in these presentations need to be updated? 
Obviously they enjoy being hit with rotten tomatoes.  Does the facility have a proper security force for this?  Not to say that people in California are reactionaries or any thing . . . .  You can tell FERC's doing it as a symbolic gesture since none of the other commissioners are going. 
As you may already know, the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow. They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" -  this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c).  16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities.  We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's  decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market.

FYI.  This is just a master under which we can do individual agreements. 
We have received the executed Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 11/14/2000 from the referenced CP.  Copies will be given to Legal and Credit. THIS IS AN EDISON ELECTRIC INSTITUTE (EEI) AGREEMENT. 
Attached find the latest draft of Alan's technical paper.  This is still a work in progress.  The paper will serve as the basis for our comments on the FERC's November 1 order on the California market.  Alan developed this paper in close coordination with Tim Belden and Greg Wolfe.  I wanted to run this by you so you would have an opportunity to give us any input from EES's perspective.  Ron Carroll will also be sending us a draft pleading that will accompany this paper.  However, the pleading will simply summarize the positions set out in Alan's paper and lay out a few additional legal arguments, so it is most important for you to focus on this paper.  Ron will be getting us a draft by the end of the day today so we can discuss it in our conference call early tomorrow.

See attached. 
Here's the pleading that will accompany Alan's affidavit.  We plan, at this point, to send a cover letter with this saying that we will be sending our responses to Hoecker's questions on Tuesday.  We need this additional time to get the input of our commercial people. 
We need to have a conference call about this ASAP.  These are due Friday!

I will be sending to changes to Ron's draft as I write them.   Here's the first one: Under the bullet about the soft cap, cross out the language saying ""At a minimum the Commission should raise the cap to $250 per MWh,"" and insert: ""As detailed in the attached analyses, price caps only interfere with the price signals so necessary to the proper functioniung of the California markets.

Finish off the soft cap paragraph by saying that: The Commission should also establish a 15-month sunset period on the price cap and any reporting requirement and refund obligation, subject to an affirmative Commission finding that futher market intervention is necessary.

I. Market Design A. Delete the clause beginning ""at a minimum ...."" from the title. 
This is my last edit. I.    Market Designs B. Paragraph 3 - Should be rewritten as follows: In sum, the Commission's proposal for a soft cap, combined with the complex nature of the reporting requirement and refund potential has introduced substantial uncertainty in the market and therefore substantial risk of and disincentive to do business in the California market.  To ensure participation, the Commission needs to create clear, uncomplicated review standards.  In addition, if the Commission insists on a cap it must at a minimum establish a higher hard price cap and provide that the refund obligation will not be applicable to sales below that level.  Such a safe harbor is required to prevent disincentives to the development of new generation and to ensure liquidity and reliability in the California market. 
I. Market Design A. Delete the clause beginning ""at a minimum ...."" from the title. 
The CPUC has protested the ISO's recent replacement of Volume Nos. I and II of its tariff.  The ISO's tariff filing does not propose changes to any substantive provision and is intended to be an uncontroversial filing to comply with the designation and formatting requirements of FERC's Order 614. Nevertheless, the CPUC: Asks FERC to reject and modify the confidentiality and disclosure provisions of the tariff such that they do not apply to requests for information from California state agencies with statutory responsibilities related to regulation or oversight of the electric industry.  CPUC asks the provisions be modified to require the ISO to respond to such requests in the same manner as it responds to data requests from FERC itself. Points out that the ISO has used this provision to refuse to provide responses to the CPUC's subpoena including bid data. Also asserts that the Western System Coordinating Council's (WSCC) extra high voltage (EHV) data is available in real time to all WSCC members, including market participants. I was wondering if others agree we should file an answer to the CPUC's answer, stating the following. The ISO should make all market information available to all market participants as we laid out in our comments on the FERC's November 1 order. Not all market participants get EHV data - since [date?] the ISO has refused to provide this information to the WSCC unless the WSCC keeps this information confidential, due to its tariff's confidentiality provisions. Accordingly the ISO's data is now only being provided to those market participants with control areas. However, we have no way of knowing, and therefore assume that utilities, munis, and Federal Power Marketing Administrations with control areas are providing this information to their merchant function.  This access to market information is unduly discriminatory.  To rectify this undue discrimination, the FERC should delete the confidentiality provision altogether. The CPUC's filing is procedurally defective in that the ISO did not change the confidentiality provision of its tariff so the CPUC's filing should have been in a complaint in which it would have the burden of proof.  Therefore,

In general, I don't think we should refer to WPTF arguments where we have made our own arguments, in particular on number 5. We should summarize EES/EPMI's arguments as I did in my proposed draft answer to this question.  With respect to answers to questions 2 and 4,  I think we should make more legally-oriented arguments essentially restating the arguments we made in EES/EPMI's comments to FERC, along the lines of my proposed draft answers.  Although the Commissioners will not read our pleadings, they are likely to read our answers to these questions so this will give us an opportunity to summarize our pleadings.  In addition, these are positions that we have already agreed to and discussed.  For those of you who don't have my suggested draft answers, they are attached. Susan J Mara@ENRON 11/28/2000 10:43 PM 
Here's a short but sweet draft.  Alan will be providing data and Ron will be providing some additional language on question 5 (or whichever one talks about J&R rates).  We're also still trying to get the chart referred to in Question 2 -- so for now we have no answer for that one. I'm in the office Wed but in a few meetings.  Call or e-mail comments.  415 782-7802

California Consumer Group Submits Electricity Reregulation Ballot Initiative Nov. 28, 2000 Dow Jones Online News (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -- A California consumer group submitted a draft ballot initiative to the governor and state legislature Tuesday, calling for a publicly owned and controlled electricity system. The Foundation For Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called for the creation of a state power authority that would build and operate power plants, transmission and distribution facilities. It also advocated the oversight of electricity rates by the state Public Utilities Commission, and the issuance of refunds to San Diego customers who were hit with large bills this summer when they were exposed to full market rates. The consumer group filed papers Tuesday with the Secretary of State to establish a campaign committee called the Campaign for the Protection of Ratepayers, which would sponsor the 2002 ballot measure, FTCR announced at a press conference Tuesday. Refunds should be issued to customers of Sempra (SRE) unit San Diego Gas and Electric Co. via a ""windfall profits tax"" on power companies that sold energy at unjust and unreasonable prices, according to the FTCR draft. The PUC should be authorized to establish the thresholds for excessive energy prices that would be used in determining the tax. It should also be able to oversee the issuance of refunds, as well as electric rates on a cost-of-service basis, the FTCR said. At the same time, the PUC should be restructured so its commissioners are more publicly accountable. A Citizen Utility Board should also be created to protect consumer interests, the FTCR said. The FTCR also advocated that a separate state agency be created that could build, own, operate and buy power plants and transmission and distribution assets. That agency could auction the right to build plants to, or contract with, private generators that would sell energy to utilities on a cost-of-service basis. As well, the FTCR recommended giving authority to state and local governments to take over generation, transmission and distribution assets if necessary. No specifics were given in the draft on what would necessitate such a takeover. FTCR stressed that Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PGE) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co. shouldn't be permitted to back bill customers for the unexpectedly high cost of buying wholesale power this summer. The two utilities have filed lawsuits against the PUC for authority to recover those costs, as they are unable to do so while their customers are under a state-mandated rate freeze. ""Any effort to force the ratepayers to pay even one cent more to cover the greed and stupidity of the utility companies in this disaster of their own making will conclude our participation in the legislative process,"" said FTCR president Harvey Rosenfield. Mr. Rosenfield questioned how the utilities could claim they are having financial difficulties when they donated $1.2 million to lawmakers and lobbyists in this year's third quarter, and called for a moratorium on power company campaign contributions. ""We urge elected officials to cease accepting money from any of the interested utility and power companies ... while the deliberations are underway. To fail to do so will cause the public to doubt the integrity of the legislative process,"" Rosenfield said. Mr. Rosenfield also said his group would ""not participate in any behind-closed-doors legislative negotiations or discussions,"" saying that the 1996 deregulation law was ""the product of a three-week legislative ramrod featuring back-room meetings, late-night hearings, payoffs

I would not convert footnotes to endnotes- quick review: looks very good. I will review in more detail over weekend. Thanks. 
I'm forwarding a notice from the California ISO, telling us it will be responding to a very broad Subpoena from the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB).  Many of the questions relate to the period of from September 2000 through November 2000.  The ISO indicates that it will be answering the requests because the EOB has granted what it believes is an adequate protective order.  This order agrees to keep the answers to certain questions confidential, but to provide them to the CPUC and the AG if they agree to keep them confidential.  If we have concerns about the confidential order we are supposed to advise the ISO by Monday 12/1, at 9:00 a.m.  The subpoeana, and confidential order, and a letter explaining the treatment of the various requests are attached. I am assuming that because the order appears to protect our commercial interests, we will not protest this.  Richard - let me know if you want to have a conference call on this and I'll have Lysa set one up. 
Given the importance of this document to the traders and given that the FERC may be considering a number of these dockets at its December 13th meeting and given that the agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, I would wait until the agenda is posted to update and forward to the traders.  The FERC's agenda is posted at: www.ferc.fec.us/public/isd/sunshine/htm 
On interconnection, I think our approach has been that the ISO should be the party you have an interconnection contract with, not the utility. James D Steffes@EES 09/06/2000 05:29 AM 
Sarah -- Looks fine.  Did Craig Roach contribute? I wonder if we should highlight the Interconnection problems we are having with new generation?  I know that most of the delays are Siting related, but it is unclear to me if the ISO or the local utility is the right point of contact.  This would help us nationally and gives FERC an ""answer"" - enforce your Interconnection policies!! Also, this doesn't mention any possible market flaws.  Do we think that some exist?  Are any of the AS markets manipulated?  EPSA needs to make sure that it takes an honest approach to this situation or its credibility will be destroyed.  Has Craig Roach looked into this? Jim Sarah Novosel@ENRON 09/05/2000 02:39 PM 
Here is EPSA's ""Fact Sheet"" on California.  We're discussing it at the EPSA power marketers' weekly conference call tomorrow.  We're also considering having EPSA submit this Fact Sheet to the CPUC  in response to the data requests sent by the CPUC (responses are due on Friday).  If you have any comments or suggested changes, please let me know (as soon as possible) in case EPSA submits this paper to the CPUC. Thanks Sarah 
MEMORANDUM TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketing Working Group FROM: Donald Santa, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Joe Hartsoe, Power Marketing Working Group Chair Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy DATE: August 30, 2000 
Based on what we heard from FERC last week, we should: Be taking a leadership role in either EPSA, WPTF, our whichever entity thinks most like Enron and has the largest number of members. Decide the five most important issues we want FERC to address and try to work on these issues through that group. I think Joe should be spearheading this effort. Accordingly, I think it is most appropriate to work on things like responding to the Joskow/Hogan papers through that group. 
It's our understanding that the FERC will now be considerting at a Friday meeting its order on the California invetsigation.  Lysa Akin is setting up an audio connection.  Lysa, please contact Dennis, Jubron and Neil about this. 
Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today: How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price? I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Hall's summary.  There's some=20 redundancy but hopefully, this provides a few more details.    Also, Mary H= .=20 and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to= =20 approve the ISO=01,s request in full. Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing): The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO. 1) ISO=01,s $250/MWh Soft Cap a) Summarized: ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so= ft=20 cap but raises the soft cap level to $250 from the $150/MWh proposed by the= =20 FERC: =01&The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi= th an=20 interim =01&soft=018 price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th= e=20 Commission=01,s November 1 Order. The ISO=01,s scheduling system will not r= eject=20 Energy bids priced in excess of the $250/MWh price cap, but will evaluate= =20 those bids in price merit order. However, if the ISO issues Dispatch=20 instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in=20 excess of the $250 soft cap, those bids will not set the Market Clearing=20 Price for Imbalance Energy. Rather, those Scheduling Coordinators will be= =20 paid in accordance with their bids.=018 b) Refund risk and cost documentation above $250. =01&Imbalance Energy abov= e the=20 level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund, based on subsequent= =20 review by the Commission. It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th= at=20 submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission, a= s=20 well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha= t=20 they may bring questionable bids to the Commission=01,s attention. i) Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental= =20 to what was requested by the FERC. See p. 8 ii) Regarding production costs:  fuel, taxes, emission credits, startup cos= ts=20 are all listed as costs.  However, no mention of noncontiguous scheduling= =20 costs or reasonable profit. iii) Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs:  In a footnote to cover letter= ,=20 ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess = of=20 10% of the production costs or $25/MWh, whichever is lesser. c) Useful quote: =01&In light of current fuel prices and the ISO=01,s recen= t=20 experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at= =20 prices of $150 or less in many hours, the ISO believes that a $150 soft cap= =20 would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an as-bid basis.= =018 d) Effective date: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00.=20 e) Term of this soft cap:  lesser of 3 mo (3/8/01) or whenever the Commissi= on=20 supercedes it by its own order. f) Applicable tariff sections.  Section 2.5.23.2 and .3.  See attachments= =20 A1/B1 to the filing. 2) Participating Generator Penalties a) Summary: =01&the ISO proposes in Amendment No. 33 to assess penalties ag= ainst=20 Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO=20 Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to= =20 avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency. They would be charged an= =20 amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea= ch=20 hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond. In addition, i= f,=20 during that hour, the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other= =20 than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as=20 interruptible, the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty = of=20 $1000/MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver.=018 b) Allowed excuse:  The penalties would not apply if the Participating=20 Generator has notified the ISO (within the hour of instruction), and=20 subsequently demonstrates (documentation within 72 hours) , that its=20 Generating Unit, System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to=20 operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not = be=20 waived. c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of 5.6.1 .2 and .3. See=20 attachments A2/B2 to the filing. d) Effective date: Same as the ISO=01,s new soft cap: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00 e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision. 3) Load Imbalance Penalties a) Summary: =01&Scheduling Coordinators who rely on that  market to serve t= heir=20 Loads the ISO=01,s costs of obtaining Energy through bids above the propose= d=20 soft price cap or through out-of-market Dispatches when bids are=20 insufficient. Specifically, those costs would be allocated to Scheduling=20 Coordinators in proportion to their Demand that appears unscheduled in=20 real-time (underscheduled Load) and Generation that is scheduled but does n= ot=20 appear in real-time, except to the extent that the underscheduled Load or= =20 undelivered Generation is balanced within the Scheduling Coordinator=01,s= =20 portfolio.=018  The costs of dispatching units that have bid above the Mark= et=20 Clearing Price for Energy to Scheduling Coordinators in proportion to their= =20 Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations (in essence, the amount by which their= =20 metered Demand exceed their metered Generation). Cover letter, p. 10.=20 b) Net Negative Uninstructed Deviation (NNUD) defined: =01&The real time ch= ange=20 in Generation or Demand associated with underscheduled Load (i.e., Load tha= t=20 appears unscheduled in real time) and overscheduled Generation (i.e.,=20 Generation that is scheduled in forward markets and does not appear in real= =20 time). Deviations are netted for each BEEP Interval, apply to a Scheduling= =20 Coordinator=01,s entire portfolio, and include Load, Generation, Imports an= d=20 Exports=018 c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of  11.2.4.2.1.  See=20 attachments A3/A3/B3 to the filing. d) Effective date:  For loads scheduled for  12/12/00.  (Essentially, loads= =20 scheduled on 11/11 for next day). e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision. 4) Useful Info from the Detmers Declaration a) =01&During the recent 7-day period from December 1, 2000 through Decembe= r 7,=20 2000, planned Generating Unit outages have averaged roughly 4,000 MW. Durin= g=20 this same 7-day period, forced or unplanned outages of generating have be= =20 very high, averaging approximately 7,000 MW. =01& b) =01&For example, for the last four days (December 4, 2000 to December 7,= =20 2000) we have purchased 255,000 MWh of OOM Energy. The cost of these=20 purchases were approximately $167 million. MWh.=018  (Equivalent to an aver= age=20 OOM cost of $655/MWh.) 
This information updates the WSCC data and supplies support for the data in my and Tim's presentations.  In particular, it shows that there is more scarcity than we originally stated because the WSCC data relied on assumed that all of the hydro capacity could be used when, in fact, the hydro system is overbuilt such that if all the capacity available were used at Grand Coullee, downstream areas would be flooded. 
Just in from Bill Comish at WSCC. Includes California subpoena seeking records of EHV access and WSCCnet activity.

San Diego Gas & Electric Company's filing for emergency relief asked FERC to re-impose price caps for short-term releases of capacity for service to the California border and to points of interconnection between interstate pipelines and California LDCs, and provide that sellers be required to state separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate 
We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments? 
Here's the next draft of the FERC presentation.  I know this looks long, but if you down load it and use the ""Slide Show"" mode, it will hide many of  slides that will not be presented but will instead be provided, in hard copy, as supporting information.  I realize there are formatting errors, but the basics are now there.(See attached file: August 24 presentation to FERC1.ppt) 
Yes we do care.  The question is: are we going to do anything?  Robin and Richard will be discussing this this afternoon. The CPUC's motion only applied to the generators, not the ISO.  I guess the ISO was viewed as cooperating. Susan J Mara@ENRON 12/13/2000 09:56 AM 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas -- FOR YOUR INFORMATION The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a court tells them not to.  DO we care about this? Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC-- given the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info? Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC claims identify those who have abused market power. 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO Tariff section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly, the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20 unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4 which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in the past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an outage and projected in service date since this information could be used by Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current requests.

bids 
The ISO filed a response at FERC to the PX's request to remove the hard cap= =20 on adjustment bids and=20 replace it with a floating cap that would track the price of energy in the= =20 market. =20 The ISO opposes the proposal arguing that it may produce extremely high=20 constrained Zonal market clearing=20 prices in the forward markets and may be subject to the exercise of market= =20 power and to gaming. =20 The ISO suggests the PX fix this by anchoring its Adjustment Bids=20 (incremental and  decremental bids) prices=20 to the unconstrained market clearing price, as opposed to absolute Energy= =20 bids.  In other words, the PX would=20 establish its constrained market clearing price as the sum of the=20 unconstrained market clearing price and the=20 Usage Charge resulting from the ISO=01,s Congestion Management process. =20 To effectuate this change, the PX would have to impose a new rule that=20 Adjustment Bids be within $125 of the=20 unconstrained market clearing price. The PX would then be required to proce= ss=20 the Adjustment Bids prior to=20 passing them on to the ISO. The PX would have to subtract the unconstrained= =20 market clearing price from each=20 Adjustment Bid prior to submitting it to the ISO. The ISO would then utiliz= e=20 these Adjustment Bids, as well as=20 those submitted by other Scheduling Coordinators, to run its Congestion=20 Management system. After the ISO=20 completes its  Congestion Management process, the ISO would then=20 ""post-process"" the Adjustment Bids=20 (add back the unconstrained market clearing price) for use by the PX in=20 establishing its constrained Zonal=20 Energy prices and, as needed, by the ISO in real-time Congestion Management= .=20 The ISO says it does not intend, by presenting this alternative to the PX= =01,s=20 proposal, to preclude consideration=20 of other solutions that may be presented by one or more of the utilities or= =20 by the EOB. =20 The ISO also argued that the Commission should impose reporting requirement= s=20 on those entities who submit=20 Adjustment Bids in the ISO=01,s Congestion Management process.  It recommen= ds=20 that the Commission require=20 the submission of all Adjustment Bids to the Commission, the ISO and the=20 EOB.  It also asked the Commission=20 to direct the PX Market Monitoring Unit, in concert with the ISO=01,s Depar= tment=20 of Market Analysis, to increase its=20 monitoring of Adjustment Bids and bids submitted in the PX forward Energy= =20 markets for evidence of the=20 exercise of market power. The ISO argues that the effect of the FERC's December 8 Order on supply=20 sufficiency in the ISO=01,s real time=20 Imbalance Energy market was immediate and beneficial.  It states the=20 following in support.  Although supply=20 in California is still very tight, after implementation of Amendment No. 33= ,=20 there were bids available in the ISO=01,s=20 ""BEEP Stack"" to address California=01,s real time balancing needs for the f= irst=20 time in nearly a week. Immediately=20 after the order was issued 3000 to 5000 MW of Generation internal to=20 California and up to an additional 1990 MW=20 of imports became available to the ISO.  The following day there was only o= ne=20 hour in which reserves dropped=20 below 6% and one hour in which reserves were as great as 10%. In addition, = it=20 alleges that the implementation=20 of Amendment No. 33 has substantially relieved the burden which had=20 previously been placed on the ISO=01,s=20 operators by in-state Generators attempting to negotiate prices in real tim= e=20 in response to ISO Dispatch instructions. The ISO also requests that the Commission clarify its December 8 Order to= =20 confirm that sellers submitting bids=20 above $250 in the ISO=01,s Imbalance Energy Market are required to report t= heir=20 bids and provide cost information=20 on a weekly basis not only to the Commission, but also to the California=20 Electricity Oversight Board and the ISO. =20 The ISO requests clarification that the Commission intended to approve the= =20 proposed December 12,=20

Here's the latest info. about the FERC meeting.  Only Commissioners and their Staffs will be attending, no additional FERC Staff (no one from the Office of Markets and Tariff Rates).  The Meeting is mostly an opportunity for customers to blow off steam.  Presentations will be made by the three IOUs, one generator, one marketer (Enron) and one ESP, UCAN, and various politicians.  When I get the list I'll forward it.  Each presenter will have about five minutes with no questions from the audience.  Panelists should expect questions and discussion among panelists or in response to Commissioner's questions. Attached is the latest FERC notice about the California meeting.  It recognizes that there may be discussions about pending FERC cases.  This does not mean FERC will be grilling our panelist about these cases.  Rather, FERC has to issue this notice so if someone talks about an issue pending in one of those cases, the Commissioners don't violate the government in the sunshine rules. (See attached file: EL00-91.1)

MEMORANDUM TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee FROM: Don Santa, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Joe Hartsoe, Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy DATE: September 8, 2000 RE: California: The Real Story Attached is the final version of California: The Real Story.  It will be distributed in San Diego next week at both the Congressional field hearing (September 11th) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting (September 12th).  EPSA will also file the document next week at the California Public Utilities Commission in docket I00-08-002, the Commission's investigation into the functioning of wholesale electric markets and the associated impact on retail rates. Thank you all for your help in finalizing the document!

Looks fine to me.  Thanks. Jeff Dasovich@EES 09/08/2000 11:03 AM 
Attached are the draft message points.  As always, all comments, suggestions, etc. are encouraged and welcome.  I have five minutes.  Consequently, based on what other panelists say, and general tenor of the hearing, may end up emphasizing some points more and others less in opening, and use any Q & A to round things out.  Joe/Mary:  any final word on format/participants?  Thanks. Best, Jeff 
Tim always tells me EPMI's biggest problem about accessing transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information.  Tim wants all ISO information - as he says ""more, better, faster.""  In other words he wants: meter and outage information, water levels, bids and schedules, actual flows, transmission availability and congestion. Making this information available is necessary for three reasons.  This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market.  It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market.  It would also, as Sue points out, remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders. Susan J Mara@EES 09/08/2000 12:06 PM 
OK.  I'll take a shot in answering your questions, Steve. Others are free to comment as well. The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened.  If you talk to the traders, they LOVE it.  Before April1, 1998, they had no sales to CA.  Now, they have millions of dollars of sales.  Why?  -- no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over. We still have some problems, however.  The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them.  We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them.  We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path 15 probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it. The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path 15. So, what are the access issues? Path 15 is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA.  Has been for years. The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla. When I left PG&E in 1996, the estimated coast was $300 million.  The congestion costs did not justify building the line then. PG&E continues to control Path 15 and tells the ISO what's left after PG&E allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes. There is no transparency.  PG&E has the ability to use Path 15 to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts.  Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesn't think PG&E is, but;... The ISO says it can't interpret PG&E's contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how it's some kind of overseer -- we protested and have now appealed.  The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One -- their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights -- more like interruptible -- but once the ISO started, all of a sudden, the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights (as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff). That's why we have pushed the issue.  Also, Dynegy and Power Exchange (not the PX) have rights on Path 15.  Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated. Information in general is pretty sketchy on real-time transmission.  We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows what's going on in transmission (as do the utilities), changes what it does, which then changes prices, and then doesn't tell us until after the fact.  The ISO has promised to do better, but I don't think has implemented any real changes yet. Advantageous access. Except for what's going on in Path 15, I don't think the IOUs have any advantages on access -- except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro -- but I think it's resource specific, rather than owner specific. The munis are another story.  See next item. Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country.  In making a devil's bargain with the munis, the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation.  The ""sanctity of contracts"" under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents (not the IOUs -- but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs) and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market.  The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munis/Dynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do (e.g., some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins, some get to do it every half hour, so far most haven't had to pay for ancillary services, etc.) There are many, many examples of how we are discriminated against (in addition to Path 15) and of how FERC has shined us on -- but yet we fight on. 
When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.  We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control ""path 15""?  Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there other examples and are there links between these ""preferences"" and the current problems in California?  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us. 
We will be asking for confidential treatment unless and until the FERC requires similar information to be released by all market participants. 
Attached find Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services' responses to the Staff's data requests in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Bulk Power Investigation.  These responses assumes that you sent separate data requests to Enron Wind, so they do not include that information.  The answers also assume you are requesting this information for California (and therefore the Western interconnect) only.  Please let me know if these assumptions are incorrect. If you were requesting Eastern Interconnect information you need to contact Chrisit Nicolay at the above E-mail address.  Enron requests confidential treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Section 388.112.  Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable to respond to question 8 and to provide the Unit Identifier requested in question 4.  We hope to be able to provide this information on Monday. Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-8862.  I will be traveling on 
Ron and Seabron - thank you for responding so quickly and putting together such a good product.  I would suggest only the following additions:  I would mention that the Commission should also require simplified interconnections and encourage faster certification of generation.  You simply touch on hedging, I would explain why, given that they had the  opportunity, it would have been prudent (with a simple example like how going to the spot market and then asking for a price cap is like day trading your retirement and then asking for legislation requiring a minimum price or something like that).  I really like the gas industry discussion.  Seabron, can you verify the 20 loads and 40 gens - that was just a number Tim Belden through out (although he should know)?  If you send me another version tomorrow, fax it to me at the Ritz Carlton at Tysons Corner, I'll be in the Consulate Room from 9-11. After that, call me on my cell phone at 503-807-0929. 
Attached is a draft response to the economics arguments made by the Electricity Oversight Board.  Please let me know if you have any problems with these.  These arguments need a little wordsmithing but they are sound. 
Jim is available at 10:00 pacific time.  Does that work for others?  Jim - Ron suggests having Carl Imparato on the call because of his extensive knowledge of California markets.  What do you think? If you were looking for an attached list, I haven't prepared it yet. James D Steffes@EES 09/14/2000 09:42 AM 
9am Central time is bad for me.  I could do it at 8am Central or 12noon Central.  Don't hold off for me. Jim Mary Hain@ECT 09/14/2000 11:32 AM 
I'd like to have a conference call tommorrow at 9:00 a.m. to review Tim's ""top 5"" priorities to fix the wholesale market in California.  I need to do this tomorrow so Seabron and Ron can write our pleading for the Section 206 proceeding while I'm on vacation next week.  Please let me know ASAP if 9:00 is a bad time or if you don't want to be on the call. 
If you thought I ignored any of your communications last week, I did it because I was on vacation.  I'm back!  I'll catch up as soon as I can. Read attached draft from EPSA. 
FYI 
Thanks Jim.  ENA is very interested in this topic.  I was talking with Mona last week about my view that a strategy with PG&E should be supportive, not adversarial.    ENA is extremely interested in a gas management position with PG&E and they have made it clear to us that our public positions against them are a significant commercial issue.  I will spend some time with Portland and SF to get an ENA consensus on these points. Chris James D Steffes@EES 09/21/2000 09:28 PM 
FYI. If you are not aware, PG&E is pushing for immediate end of their retail rate cap (so they can collect wholesale energy costs). EES is considering its positions in that matter to prepare for CPUC and legislative proceedings. I want to make sure that you are aware of these internal discussions.  Key from EPMI include (1) endorse Cal ISO report conclusions, (2) competititve default supplier, (3) increasing rate freeze for all customers, and (4) transfer of PG&E Hydro to affiliate at $2.8B (to offset current undercollection). Please let me know if these positions make sense to you.  While I think that our general position is retail volatility, given the current situation in SDG&E that is simply impossible politically. Please feel free to call. Jim 
Sounds fine to me. Susan J Mara@EES 09/28/2000 04:04 PM 
WPTF has just voted to file a protest on Amendment 30 (the ISO is asking to be able to buy power for itself in the forward market).  I agreed to fund as did 4, maybe 5, others.  The discussion was not exactly as you describe below but I will be able to have lots of input on the filing, and am sure I can get the points included.  Therefore, I recommend that Enron NOT make a separate filing on this. Here is what WPTF voted on:  Ask FERC to limit ISO procurement only to the super peak product that has already been developed by the APX and require that the price caps end in 6 months; if the ISO wishes to renew the price caps it would have to file 60 days in advance of the 6-month deadline. Mary Hain@ECT 09/28/2000 12:28 PM 
Sue- in WPTF's protest of Amendment 30, is WPTF proposing to make the following arguments?  If not we need to have Ron give an estimate for an RCR and draft a protest. Amendment 30, which would allow the Cal ISO to do limited forward contracting and to allocate the costs thereof to under/overschedulers (protests due Oct.2)the traders would like to say that the ISO should not be in the forward market, rather the IOUs should be in the forward market and should be incented to do so.  Rather than doing anything to fix this failure to hedge and underscheduling by the IOUs, this filing would further amplify the problem by concentrating even more transactions with the ISO and lead to the slippery slope to the ISO running the entire market. Since, the filing also creates other problems.  Through the proposal to do bilateral deals without first receiving bids, the ISO moved itself out of compliance with Order No. 2000 (assuming it ever complied) by starting to violate the independence characteristic - the FERC's first minimum characteristic for an RTO.  Under this, the RTO is required to be independent of market participants.  Order No. 2000 defines a market participant as any entity or its affiliate that buys or sells electric energy in the RTO's region or in any neighboring region that might be effected by the RTO's actions. Further, the ISO is already buying out of market and this move would further complicate existing problems that we have with OOM. In addition, although the filing claims that it's request is  limited, yet there is no time limitation.  Further, the limitation seems to have little real effect. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Unless Chris tells me otherwise, we will continue what we've been saying in California, but I think how we do that without individually naming the utilities is pointing to what the ""IOUs"" are doing in general and clarifying that the IOUs are making logical decisions in light of the mixed up regulatory framework imposed on the market.  That's how we said it at FERC. Is that okay with you Chris? 
I disagree with you about question 2.  While I agree that transmission acess wasn't the number one problem in California this summer, transmission access is not close to being perfect in California (for example PG&E controls the information about path 15 and the ISO still has not auctioned off 100 percent of the FTRs in the market) and certainly corrections to these problems would make the market more liquid which would help to alleviate the price spike problem.  So even though access is not the number one or even the number two problem causing price spikes this summer it contributed and it is one of the biggest problems with the California market, relatively, and it is something that FERC can fix (as compared to fixing hedging and underscheduling which they seem content to leave to the state regulators).  Perhaps Tom could fix his question accordingly. Sarah Novosel@ENRON 10/04/2000 07:41 AM 
Tom: The questions look good, and I agree with Rick's comments regarding RTO participation.  We should try and pin Hoecker down on the problems with the voluntary approach.  I have a couple of additional thoughts on the questions: In question two, you should also ask Hoecker directly about the time it takes to interconnect.  The interconnection process can take a long time due to utility holdups that are not necessary.  I would ask something like, ""What is the length of time it typically takes to interconnect a generator to the grid once the generator makes the request for interconnection?  Can FERC take action to shortened this time to help accelerate the development and operation of new generation in California and elsewhere throughout the

We made a separate filing.  Ron hasn't sent me the final draft.  But when he sends it I'll forward it. 
The PX proposed its price cap to become effective on the earlier of October 22. FERC issued a letter requiring the PX to file (and serve on all intervenors (including EPMI)) the following proof by October 20th: Any data demonstrating market distortions without the price caps Any data indicating that in certain hours the PX prices have not been disciplined by the ISO's prices Any data demonstrating that the CalPX Day-of and Day-Ahead and the CalISO Real time markets do not operate in an inter-related manner. Since the data is due on a Friday and the proposed effective date is a Sunday, its seems unlikely that FERC will have enough time to act on the proposal before the effective date unless FERC has the order already drafted.  Either they're just trying to cover themselves or they're trying to find a reason to reject the filing. Ron - please make sure we get this information as soon as it's filed. 
Here's Peace's letter.  Sorry I didn't have time to summarize it. 
No but we found out what they want.  They don't really want all the other stuff they asked for.  What they really want is our financial information (profit and loss). 
What WSJ data request? Jeff Dasovich@EES 08/29/2000 08:31 AM 
I have received several comments about the WSJ data request. Enron's Tim Beldon wrote me that he would consider it.  The PX's Gene Waas was concerned based on previous experiences of letting data go to the WSJ.  I talked with Dynegy's Lynn Lednicky this morning and he suggested that the PX has aggregated data for several days, and that releasing the aggregate data with individual bid data from our members would give the WSJ a better window into the issues.  That is, simply releasing your bid data will not tell the WSJ anything of value. I know that Rebecca would insist that the dates for which any data are polled our at her choice, not ours.  It must be necessary to assure there is no possibility of bias.  I am wondering if the PX would be willing to assist us by putting together aggregate data for days which the WSJ selects, and then give us the opportunity to release our individual data for the same days? I am also wondering if we shouldn't have an off-the-record teleconference call with the WSJ whereby both sides can get a better understanding of what the WSJ wants, and how we can best provide it. Would anyone be interested in me setting up such a meeting for next week, say Wednesday or Thursday? gba

We're getting close to a final draft of our filing in FERC's investigation of the wholesale market in California.  So if you would like an opportunity to read it please get me your comments by tomorrow. The motion still does not have a section on governance, but Ron is drafting it and it will simply summarize Seabron's paper.   Also, I made some changes to Ron's draft to require the FERC to find that it has a pervasive system of wholesale regulations in California and that the CPUC is therefore pre-empted from placing restrictions on hedging by wholesale market participants.  I think that argument could be extended to cover the UDC's recovery of stranded costs, but have not added that to the draft.   I wanted to get your feed back first.  If the stranded cost mechanism isn't fixed, I'm not sure that the other market changes we have recommended will be sufficient.  On the other hand, maybe the PUC is on its way to fixing this part of the problem.  Do you want to have this discussion via E-mail or do you want a conference call on this? 
SCE, PG&E and TURN have asked FERC for a $100 price cap and cost-of-service 
For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan.

In the public meeting today, the Commissioners discussed the order, EL 01-47, for relief to the California and western state markets. The order announces certain action to be taken to increase supply and reduce demand. As stated, the actions are:  1) require California ISO and transmission owners to file grid enhancements that can be achieved in short-term; 2) extends and broadens temporary  waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for QFs; 3) waives prior notice requirements and grants market-based rate authority for wholesale power sales; 4) authorizes retail/wholesale customers to reduce consumption to resell their load reduction at wholesale at market-based rates; 5) announces staff conference this Spring to discuss hydro-licensees, resource agencies the possibility of increased generation consistent with environmental protection. Addtionally, the order seeks comments by March 30, 1) rate incentives for electric transmission and gas facilities that provide additional capacity in the short term; 2) use of interconnect authority (Section 210.d of FPA) to help alleviate impediments to additional supply; 3) waiving natural gas blanket certificate regulations to increase the dollar limits for facilities under automatic authorization and prior notice authorization; 4) offering blanket certificates for construction for acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance pipeline capacity to California; 5) allowing for greater flexibility that license hydroelectric projects to increase generation while protecting environmental resources. FERC Commissioners intend to meet with Western state commissioners and other regulators to discuss price volatility and other FERC related issues that have recently been identified by the western governors. This will be a one-day conference.

On Tuesday, Tucson filed a complaint against the Power Exchange and Governor Davis, arguing that the FERC should render null and void the unconditional transfer of SCE and PG&E's block forward contracts.  It argues that such a transfer requires prior FERC approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and should be conditioned by FERC to protect the public interest.  It also argues that FERC should order the PX to enforce its tariff, by requiring the PX to immediately collect from PG&E and SCE all monies due for wholesale sales to date.

By its January 8 order, the FERC clarified that it did not intend to preclude the PX from engaging in bilateral forward contracting  and that the PX was free to remove spot market components from its forward contracting rate scheduling.  In its request for rehearing, the PX argued that: (1) FERC had failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its forward market rate schedule.  FERC dismissed the PX's request for rehearing of its January 8 order, finding that all of the PX's concerns emanate from the FERC's December 15 order not its January 8 order..

Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today: How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price? I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential.  He said he didn't know.

By its January 8 order, the FERC clarified that it did not intend to preclude the PX from engaging in bilateral forward contracting  and that the PX was free to remove spot market components from its forward contracting rate scheduling.  In its request for rehearing, the PX argued that: (1) FERC had failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its forward market rate schedule.  FERC dismissed the PX's request for rehearing of its January 8 order, finding that all of the PX's concerns emanate from the FERC's December 15 order not its January 8 order..

On Tuesday, Tucson filed a complaint against the Power Exchange and Governor Davis, arguing that the FERC should render null and void the unconditional transfer of SCE and PG&E's block forward contracts.  It argues that such a transfer requires prior FERC approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and should be conditioned by FERC to protect the public interest.  It also argues that FERC should order the PX to enforce its tariff, by requiring the PX to immediately collect from PG&E and SCE all monies due for wholesale sales to date. 
Summary:  The ISO announced today that it plans to submit a proposal to FERC under which it will curtail firm exports (not let suppliers send electricity out of California) during system shortages.  If approved, this proposal could have catastrophic effects on surrounding control areas because it would transfer California's supply problems elsewhere, primarily to the Pacific Northwest.  The ISO's plan to hoard electricity violates the open access principles of Order 888 and could possibly cause a cascade of contract defaults if buyers in the Pacific Northwest do not receive power and are forced to cover in this volatile market. We can wait until the ISO files this plan with FERC at the end of the month, or we can get ahead of this important issue and ask FERC to rule on this before the ISO submits its report.  A preemptive strike presumes that  we can overcome any procedural hurdles inherent in challenging an unfiled proposal. The ISO has cut some EPMI's real-time schedules over the past month or two, so perhaps we could get FERC to look at the curtailment issue in that context. Tim has asked that the legal/regulatory team make this a top priority. Because of its importance he also wants to make sure that he and other traders are actively involved in preparing the FERC complaint. Background:  Today the ISO announced the details of its ""Market Stabilization Plan.""  Although the plan may be DOA at FERC for several reasons, the ISO declared that under this plan it intends to require in-state generators to bid their full capacity into the proposed day-ahead market.  When questioned on the details of this, the ISO stated that, yes, it planned to curtail firm exports of energy from California during system shortages.  In other words, during shortages the ISO would cut the transmission schedules of in-state generators sending electricity out of California---even if those sales were ""firm,"" and even if those sales were under existing long-term contracts. The ISO argued that under its tariff it has the authority to cut schedules in emergency situations.  True.  But the reality is that the ""emergency"" is self-inflicted; by imposing price caps (another part of this Market Stabilization plan), the ISO is driving supply out of California.  As others have argued, the only ""emergency"" is price:  California has made a decision to keep consumer rates artificially low, and its use of price-controls has reduced the supply---causing a supply ""emergency""---, and the ISO now seeks to increase its supply by building a one-way wall around the state of California.  Like the roach motel, megawatts check into California, but they don't check out. Steve 
In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation, March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets.  In addition, the December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh.  Under the order, the refund potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review.  Note well that this does not entirely insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the Commission rules. 
By its January 8 order, the FERC clarified that it did not intend to preclude the PX from engaging in bilateral forward contracting  and that the PX was free to remove spot market components from its forward contracting rate scheduling.  In its request for rehearing, the PX argued that: (1) FERC had failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its forward market rate schedule.  FERC dismissed the PX's request for rehearing of its January 8 order, finding that all of the PX's concerns emanate from the FERC's December 15 order not its January 8 order..

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint. We expect to receive authorization within 60 days. Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the industrials to file their separate reports with FERC. Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial. We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi 37007.

Mary, I am working with Jeff Golden and Marc Pana in EES Corporate Development. Marc asked me to send you a list of potential substations for interconnection of mobile generation in blocks of 25 MW to 50 MW. Here is a tentative list.

FYI 
As I indicated to Jeff Golden yesterday, the problem with siting a project in APS is that it typically doesn't have any long term transmission because, in June through October, it is using the transmission to serve its native load, even to the point of selling Palo Verde and buying Four Corners uneconomically.  Accordingly, our short term traders perceive that APS sells transmission aggressively while our mid-marketers think that APS is the hardest utility to buy transmission from in the Southwest.  If you could figure out some way to sell to the market during the winter and sell to APS in the Summer it seems like that would be a good bet.  However, I would wait to talk to APS' merchant function before you submit any transmission requests to APS'  transmission function given that the traders question whether APS may try to discriminate in favor of its merchant function.  Depending on what APS' tariff says, you may have to request interconnection on-line and you have to request transmission on-line.  I will help you do this when you're ready. I have tried to check APS' OASIS for two days in a row to find out if they have transmission for the project, but the cite was down.  I'll check again today.

By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO transactions above the price cap.  We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.  We decided to do nothing rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.  Moreover, it's my understanding that we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has correctly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO. The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement actions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above the price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).  I could do one of several things for you at this point: Stay quiet Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt) Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and will not report unless and until we do Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the ""Dirty 13"" list) and we'll end up in the press again.  To lay low, I'm inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.  What do others think?  Traders - please verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.

Gary Porter of Sierra called.  He was very apologetic about not sending us an interconnection agreement sooner.  Attached is a draft that has not been reviewed by Sierra's executives yet, but I talked Gary into giving it to us anyway. Concerning our transmission request, Gary indicated that Sierra will have to perform a study because some other parties are supposedly ahead of us in the queue that would affect the available transmission capacity.  He referred me to a table on the following OASIS cite showing the competing transmission requests.  Stan or Don - please look at this table to see if you think Sierra's position has any merits.  I'll give you more details in person. Some tariff interpretation issues may also be involved depending upon whether other parties are actually ahead of us in the queue. 
Yes. 
I talked to Brian Whalen today.  He is trying to get an interconnection agreement finalized to send to us tomorrow.  Sierra/Nevada have abandoned their attempts to use the generation divestiture interconnection agreement they sent us before and is falling back on their old interconnection agreement, updated to reflect recent FERC orders.  Brian was very apologetic about taking so long. He said Sierra/Nevada is also attempting to comply with our request that they send us a transmission agreement by the end of the month. He asked me if we had gotten the Avery and Fischer reports (that would become Appendices A-C to the interconnection agreement).  I said I didn't know but that if he would E-mail them to me that I would make sure the appropriate people got them.

Calif Senate Takes Up Bill On Deal With Small Generators ? 02/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Thursday.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- California Republican Sen. Jim Battin on Thursday introduced legislation that will enable the state's electric utilities and small, independent generators to proceed with a new deal on pricing power supplies. The bill, if enacted, would lower the prices paid to so-called qualifying facilities to about 8 cents a kilowatt-hour from about 17 cents/kWh and would require California utility regulators to ensure that utilities could recover those costs from ratepayers. The new pricing would be retroactive to Feb. 1, 2001, and would run until June 30, 2006. ""This bill is a linchpin to solving the California energy crisis,"" Battin said in a press release. Qualifying facilities produce almost 30% of California 's electricity. While the individual power plants are relatively small, some big energy companies own several qualifying facilities each in California . These owners include Calpine Corp. (CPN), FPL Group (FPL), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Ogden Corp. (OG), Thermo Electron (TMO) and MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which was bought out last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A,BRK.B). Passage would allow several companies to restart some 1,000 megawatts of gas-fired generators that have been off line for several weeks. Those generators shut down their gas-fired plants, because they were unable to pay gas suppliers after the utilities fell behind on their power payments. The bill, SB47X, encompasses an agreement reached among the parties and is expected to be enacted. The generators and PG&E Corp's (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. reached an agreement on the new prices two weeks ago. It wasn't clear Thursday if Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison had signed off on the agreement, according to one of the lead negotiators. Edison wasn't able to comment immediately. Under the legislation, gas-fired cogeneration plants, which account for two-thirds of California 's qualifying facilities, will be paid based on the cost of signing a five-year gas supply contract. The producers will negotiate five-year contracts, subject to approval by the utilities, or accept a benchmark five-year gas price still to be determined. To take effect immediately as an emergency act, the bill requires approval by two-thirds of both the state Senate and Assembly. If the bill is passed, a process for quickly determining the five-year gas price would begin. Most of the small power plants that run on renewable sources such as solar panels, windmills and hydroelectric generators, will be paid a fixed price of 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the bill. The non-gas plants will also be paid about 2 cents/kwh for having the capacity available for the utilities. Previously, qualifying facilities were paid based on the spot price of natural gas at the California border, or, if the generator had elected, the California Power Exchange daily clearing price. But generators conceded that the California gas spot market had risen so sharply over the past six months that their power prices had become insupportable. The CalPX has stopped operating its market. Both PG&E and Edison have defaulted on qualifying facility payments, but the bill sets up a schedule for recovery of missed payments. The utilities are to pay for November 2000 deliveries by April 2, for December deliveries by May 1, and for January 2001 deliveries by June 1. PG&E paid its November bill on time. Calpine owns the most qualifying facilities in California . Of Calpine's 4,400 MW of total U.S. operational power plants, 575 MW are qualifying facilities under contract with PG&E. FPL Group's FPL Energy owns a little more than 500 MW of the plants. U.S. utilities have been forced under federal law to buy power from such generators since the oil crisis in the 1970s. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com

SBX 33 passed off of the Senate floor on a vote of 24-14.  The vote was along straight party lines.  The following are some of the key comments made during the debate.  Senators are identified by party affiliation. The Senate did not take up SBX 6. Sen. Morrow (R):  This bill is like a partial birth abortion  - we never gave the market a chance to work right.  It=01,s the generators who are getting the raw deal. Sen. McClintock (R):  Of the all the choices the Administration could choose to resolve this crisis, they are choosing two of the worst, to raise rates and to ensure blackouts.  LADWP is the biggest price gouger of them all so there is no reason to believe a public power authority will be better.  I would support a public power authority only to build new generation. Sen. Kuehl (D) :  The free market works only if we can say =01&no=018 to th= e product =01) can=01,t say no to energy.  Acquiring transmission lines gives the state control over the provision of energy. Sen. Scott (D) :  Reliant is spending $300 million to name a dome after itself.  My district has 3 MUD=01,s who rejected deregulation and the ratepayers are happy. Sen. Bowen (D) The only question is how much of a premium we=01,ll have to pay for bureaucracy to run the system.  Would you prefer to be gouged by unbridled market power and name stadiums in faraway places or have checks and balances? Sen. Haynes (R):  If we don=01,t get more power, we=01,re just rearranging = the deck chairs on the Titanic.  Regulatory burdens prevent companies from building in CA.  Do we want to use public dollars or private dollars to build generation.  More government won=01,t get rid of the shortage while letting more entrepreneurial money in will create a buyers market. Sen. Peace (D):  The Houston cartel with their protectors at FERC are in a wholesale attack on CA ratepayers.  Removing price caps, fixing the ISO and PX and encouraging more retail competition won=01,t fix the wholesale market.  Our constituents are threatened because FERC won=01,t do its job.  Those who didn=01,t play by the rules are responsible for this. Reliant insists that CA indemnify them from lawsuits =01) these people know they were charging illegal rates and they would lose lawsuits.  These bills are the only choice the kidnapers have given us.  Vote for it or raise the lone star flag over the Capitol. Sen Alarcon (D):  When I was on the L.A. City Council some of these same private companies wanted to buy LADWP.  Their goal is to eliminate all public power. Sen Burton (D):  If we have our own peaker power then Reliant and Enron would gladly sell us the rest of our power needs.  They are robber barons and we have no sympathy for them 
Let's promote it in all these groups, just to be on the safe side. Steve Walton 02/20/2001 09:06 AM 
Alan, I agree that we need to raise this issue in scheduling, ancillary services and congestion management content groups.  In those groups we would be selling the concept.  Actual implementation of the provisions would be in the tariff content group, where the actual requirements would be codified.  This way it will be blessed by FERC and built into all operating protocols. Steve Alan Comnes 02/18/2001 01:17 PM 
Steve, Mary, Where in the RTO West process should Enron make its pitch for information transparency?  To me, it would be part of the scheduling / ancillary services work group and part of congestion managment.  I am assuming we do not want to leave it to Makret Monitoring because to get information release in real-time or near-real-time requires that information release systems get built into the actual RTO operational systems. At some point, we need to weigh in and try to get information release built into the Stage 2 filings. Thanks, Alan 
This sounds like an issue we should be coordinating with the East desk too. 
Alan, While an open season is useful, I am not sure we need to require it in all instances.  If a developer of a generation project needs to build transmission to get its energy to market, they should be allowed to build it and get FTRs.  This presumes that the builder will have to negotiate the obstacle course associated with construction (environmental, reliability, and other siting approvals).  There are currently so many safeguards in place and building is so difficult, that any requirement for open season may well be generated when you try to use scarce right of way to build less than an optimal line.  This is exactly the debate going on in this committee, so as you say, the devil will reside at details.com. Steve Alan Comnes 02/20/2001 09:33 AM 
Steve, Mary: Other than stating that the ""devil is in the details,"" I am not sure I found this that illuminating. Can I assume that we support giving whoever invests in transmission, any identifiable capacity (via FTRs) created by the expansion?  I also assume any expansion may need an open season type procedure to make sure the expansion is broadly distributed to prevent monopoly power .... GAC

Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts until FERC does an audit.  It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts back to the generators first.  It also claims that the PX could not suspend its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.  It asks the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero. I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and (2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed in the auction. Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it? What is the significance of setting the market clearing price at zero? 
Please start drafting the intervention, as you've described and send me an estimate for the RCR. 
Attached please find two new Notices of Filing in Docket Nos. EL01-33 and EL01-34.  One is a request for a cease and desist order, the other a request for suspension of the underscheduling penalty.  The filings are also attached in a zip file.

Tim said you were having a problem using our harvester to get companys/entities' ATC that aren't complying with FERC's OASIS requirements. Tim suggested that I help you resolve this.  Could you make me a list of companies/entities that aren't complying?  Then we could discuss how to address the problem with each company/entity. Tim suggested that, to the extent we want companies to comply, we could call them and ask them to comply.  If they don't I suggested we could call the 
site 
Tim alerted everyone about this.  It's just an average for each number. 
The following are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement. In the sixth ""whereas"" (page 1) (and Sections 3.4 and 5.1.6) the contract states that either the generating company or the generating company's customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service.  In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed.  Specifically, a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific.  For example, the generator may sell the power to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service. The eighth ""Whereas"" (page 1) (and Sections 2.18, 3.1, 31.7, E.4.1, E.4.2, E.8.2, E.8.3, E.8.4, E.8.6, E.8.7, E.11.10, E.11.11, and E.12.) state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System (RMS) Agreement.  I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the ""good utility"" practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement.  Enron has signed the RMS Agreement.  I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard.  This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and, in order for RTO West to form, BPA must agree to join.  Enron is very interested in RTO West forming. If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard, we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard. Section 1.1  Contrary to our requests, this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective.   This is not the way the OATT operates.  Rather, if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement, Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC (as we have done) and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierra's open access tariff.  Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies.  The FERC has determined that filings under Section 212 (and therefor 211) of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT.  Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely  undermine the purpose of Order No. 888. Section 1.2 After, ""by both parties"" add ""however, if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement, System Owner shall file this agreement

Attached find two drafts, one a redline/strikeout and the other a clean first draft of the RTO West tariff glossary.  In addition to making the changes we discussed to the Transmission Operating Agreement, I also took the liberty of adding a number of definitions that I cribbed from the FERC pro forma (changing ""Transmisison Provider"" to ""RTO West"" where applicable).  I recognize that some of these definitions may not be applicable to the new types of transmisison service but I thought if we made these definitions available to the technical groups they could tell us if they needed them and we would be assured that terms were used consistently with the FERC pro forma 
I hope you saw this.  I was out of the office and unable to get my E-mails.

Gary, Attached you will find a November RT (Real Time)  Market Default Invoice which was receive by EPMI from the PX this morning. This invoice was published on the PX Settlement Web Site.  Again, the PX failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there. Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of it's availability.  If Market Participants don't know about this invoice being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments.  (That may be what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral.

Chris and Dave are coordinating. 
We should probably make sure we're coordinated on this one.  Greg Wolfe has a history on this one--apparently we've been contacted by Puget in the past, by certain of the customers in the past, and by consultants to the customers. Also, Dave Fuller was inquiring about Puget's customers as well. I know a bunch of the folks involved and may be able to help bridge some of the gaps--but my contacts are certainly not unique. As a final note, we need to be careful as Robert McCullough used to consult for Bellingham Cold Storage and GP--two of the companies involved in the mess.  Robert is not a friend of ours.

AReM Team: Here is report from Hertzberg news conference: Democratic Caucus announced a package of bills to increase the supply of electricity and cut down on demand through energy efficiency. The package being introduced will produce more than 750 megawatts and save 1,200 megawatts over the next few years. Said the energy efficiency package may save as many as 500 megawatts, equivalent to a new power plant. Demos presented a four bill package aimed at rapidly increasing and stabilizing the supply of power available to the demands of residents and businesses. The bills would: Provide $50 million to establish an incentive program to encourage business to install clean and modern on-site generation. Provide $150 million to develop clean and efficient renewable energy supply Allow plants up to 100 megawatts to be cityby local government andnot through Energy Commission review Ensure power by requiring new power plants to enter into purchasing agreements with the state.

Air Liquide et al v. PSE Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952 This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of a ""soft cap"" on prices PSE charges some large customers. On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint answer on the rate cap mechanism. On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary ""soft-price"" cap for power rates paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power costs if the utility was paying more than a maximum level. The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the level of the temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and the PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place pending further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48. Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific, Air Liquide America Corp. CNC Containers, Equilon Enterprises, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Tesoro Northwest, City of Anacortes, Intel Corp., King County's Metro Wastewater Treatment Division, Olympic Pipe-Bayview, Qwest and MCI WorldCo

I have only a couple of suggestions.  See red-line strike-out attached.  On the GenTie Agreement, are we not concerned about the results of third party review?

I'm following up on my email to you of 2/1 (attached below). David, it's my understanding from our call last week that we do not have a balance sheet or other accounting issue involved with these studies so long as we are not committing to any construction or other hard costs.  I've reviewed the agreements and confirmed that the only commitment being made by Antelope Valley Energy Facility, LLC, our project company  (""AVEF"") is to pay $50,000 as the cost of each study (which amount can't be increased unless AVEF agrees).  So it seems we are ok from an accounting standpoint - correct?  Please also confirm from an accounting standpoint that it is still acceptable, as we did with the initial Facilities Study Agreement with SCE for the project, that AVEF be the contract party with SCE. Mary, do you have any comments or concerns from a regulatory standpoint? The commercial team needs to sign both these agreements and submit them back to SCE this week, so please get back to me or Dean as soon as you can. Thanks, Karen 
Roger and David, I am hearing that there may be a hard cost/soft cost issue involved with interconnection system impact studies and/or tie-line studies, even though it seems that the work we would be paying for is engineering.  Please see the draft agreements that Dean forwarded to me (attached below) for the Antelope Valley development project, and let me know if we have such issues here. Mary, Can you please review the agreements and provide any comments back to me? What is the current thinking, from a regulatory standpoint, on whether we apply in the project company's name or in ENA or EPMI's name?  Roger and David, is your analysis of the above issue impacted by which entity is the party requesting the studies? Thanks, everyone, for your assistance. Karen

Although I don't yet have all the facts, Steve Hall said that late yesterday (Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX participants.  I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates the banking provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).  These provisions requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.  Second, these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent domain concerning retail service.  I don't have any law to support the second

Here's my solution.  FERC should tell the Cal ISO to file the stakeholder developed congestion management proposal arguing that it has been agreed to in the stakeholder process and that the ISO Board has no authority to do something else because they are not properly constituted.  We could also argue that the FERC should order the ISO executives to hire a consulting firm that will propose a slate of candidates and argue for a government similar to what has been proposed for RTO West.  This will help us in ultimately putting the West RTOs together.

I am under the impression that we still need to file the attached protest to a 12/13/00 Cal PX FERC filing that would (in the PX's interpretation) allow them to confiscate our collateral in the Block Forward Market to satisfy the defaults of other participants in the PX markets.  Please let me know if we don't need to file this.  Please give me your comments on the draft ASAP. 
Correct.  I wanted to terminate CTS for EPMI too but others decided this issue.  Sorry if there was any confusion.  Please make a filing for Portland General, consistent with their letter to the PX.  I am still waiting to hear from Enron Wind. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Do you want to get this or are you already an in-house compendium? 
We filed with FERC today a final version of this (which I don't yet have). We need to discuss Enron Wind doing the same.  Also, you'd need to send a letter to the PX terminating your particiaption agreement.  I'll send you the letter we sent.  I'm assuming you would want to get out of the CTS market as well as the Day-ahead and Day-of.  Call me ASAP 503-464-8862.  Thanks. 
Joshua: I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC so believe the attached Q&A meet your request.  If you need additional materials, just let me know. In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing with the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California Independent System Operator: Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the ""air traffic controller"" for the interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory. 
Linda:  Mary Hain and Tim Beldon have been working with Oregon PUC Commissioner Ronnie Euchas on electricity information disclosure.    From yesterday's hearing, there was some consensus to include legislative language in the energy bill to address transparancy issues.  As you know, Senator Wyden and Steve Kean had a positive exchange on this issue during the hearing due to the questions we had drafted.  I can work on the bipartisanship issue and gain support for federal bill inclusion from Murkowski, but we need a state federal nexis on drafting the legislative language to assure it meets both the federal and state needs.  please advise.  many thanks. 
Cynthia, Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested in following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on legislation. Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on this. - Joshua 
Linda:  do you want Dan Watkiss to be involved with the drafting also? 
Joshua:    Your boss did a great job yesterday and I thought the exchange between Steve Kean and he was very effective.  We would love to work with you and would be happy to draft some legislative language for your consideration which would address the issue.  Plus, I can be helpful in gaining bipartisan support for the provision.  Have you discussed this with Valerie at all? Since Tim Beldon in our Oregon office has met with Ronnie Euchas on disclosure, I want to include him on the drafting.  Thus, it might take me a day or two longer to get something to you.  Hopefully, I can have something drafted by Monday and I'll call you to see if I can come up and meet with you to discuss the draft lanuage, strategy, next steps, etc.  Thanks.

I'm looking into whether we have to make a filing for EES too. 
Dan, At some point in the incremental meltdown of the PX process, perhaps when we default on payment of the large chargeback bill we will receive today or tomorrow and the PX takes our remaining collateral, the question will suddenly be:  how does one make sure one is not the last man standing?  It would seem that if it is possible to ever become a  ""former""   participant in the PX and not a ""current"" one, (""current"" being  the word used in the tariff to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and CTS markets.  Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a possible extradited extraction from the PX.  Thanks.----cgy 
I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 60-day notice period. I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter. Steve 
Christian asked me to work with Dan Watkiss to prepare a FERC filing to terminate EPMI's participation in the PX.  I have asked Dan to get started as Christian said we may decide to file as soon as today.  See attached explanation.  Does EES also have a participation agreement?  And if so do we also need to file a termination for EES?

At your request, here's a write-up of our problems with the ISO. Issue 1 - Concerning the intertie going North out of California into the Northwest (NW) at the California Oregon Border (COB), since about the 24th of January, the ISO has started telling market participants that the available transmission capacity, which is usually 2300 MW, is zero.  Last Friday, this caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about $50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day. This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.  I also wonder what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take similar action.  This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if

The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving PG&E's recent reorganization.

The available transmision capacity (ATC) ""derate"" did occur and has occured everydaysince about the 24th.  This fact was verified to me by our ISO customer contact on Friday.  Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this information is verifiable with the ISO.  Our customer contact didn't know exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged.  The reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency.  The line was again rated at zero today.  I have been pursuing the following approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved.  I've talked to Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston.  Eric believes he can get the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade press.  So check the trade press tomorrow. Paul Kaufman 01/30/2001 02:41 PM 
I agree with Craig ... we need to be really, really careful about the earth orbit issues identified below.   We shouldn't talk about the derating issue unless we can:   (1) confirm the derating occurred and document it; (2) tie the derating directly to action by the new board (i.e., determine that it wasn't due to maintenance or some other physical occurence); (3) show a direct impact on PNW prices that can't be easily explained in another way; and (4) show a continuing pattern (in contrast to an isolated event).

From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO gets cheaper power over customers in the NW. I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more difficult for him to balance his budget. The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't think we want to encourage that. What do you think?  Call me. 
Craig, - In addition, it is our understanding that the ISO has not cut transmission capacity to Southern California, although that action would have the same effect as cutting transmission to the north. Jim - I have forwarded this information to Paul & Alan so they can pursue this issue with the Governors.  Could we also give this information to Clearing Up, if they promised not to quote us?  Do you think that would be helpful?

We are trying to get long term transmission service from Sierra Pacific for LV Cogen.  Sierra Pacific claims that numerous parties are ahead of us in the queue.  We disagree (for some fairly complex technical reasons that I won't detail here).  Sierra Pacific won't offer us transmission service until it resolves the requests that are ahead of us in the queue.  At this time, we are planning to keep the project and may have difficulty getting financing if we can't get the transmission service.  It is my understanding that we have exhausted all negotiating opportunities with Sierra to resolve this issue.  I would like to have Bracewell and Patterson draft a FERC filing to resolve this issue.  However, I have been told that EPMI cannot make such a filing due to the pending merger. Paul and Sarah - I'd like to confirm that we have indeed exhausted all

It was derated by 3200 MW, raising Mid-Columbia prices by $50-75/MWh.  It's not effecting Cal ISO's return of power because that power is flowing on different transmission, from the Nevada Oregon Border north, not from the California Oregon border North.

However, I drafted this letter at Alan's suggestion for purposes of discussion.  We should decide whether to send a letter before distributing this draft more widely in-house to discuss how to parse the

I thought we did not like the government of Desert Star (because it's ruled by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects of it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.  Why not wait until we get RTO West formed and then argue that the rest should be consolidated into it?  If we try to argue that California should join Desert Star it would be sort of like the tail wagging the dog and I would be concerned that California would try to take over.  Besides with RTO West, we have an organization that at least one Federal Power Marketer has said they could join. Alan Comnes 01/24/2001 07:40 AM 
Robert.Badeer@enron.com, James.D.Steffes@enron.com This seems like an idea that you would like ... 
Sue, I am amending my previous statement about the 2-year delay in creating a multi-state RTO.  If FERC were to decertify the CAISO and order the CA utilities to join a regional RTO, I believe that DSTAR, the California IOUs and the CAISO infrastructure/staff/systems could easily merge and be up and running as a large Desert Southwest + California RTO before the end of the year.  This was basically what I had been trying to achieve last summer when I was facilitating talks between CAISO and DSTAR parties about merging the two. Why not lobby for that as the FERC-preferred solution to the state's illegal takeover of CAISO governance?

Hi!  Hope all is well. FYI - -- 
ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TO REMOVE STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS OF ISO BOARD Seeks To Allow Replacement By Consumer-Oriented Members January 23, 2001 01-006 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today filed suit to have the 26 stakeholder members of the California Independent System Operator Corporation vacate their office, seeking to pave the way for a newly reconstituted board representing the interests of consumers. The ""quo warranto"" action was filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. The lawsuit asks the court to have the 26 sitting ISO members ousted from their positions. The Attorney General has offered current members an opportunity to resign and avoid further litigation. The legal move seeks to speed implementation of the new law, AB 5X, which reconstitutes the ISO into a board of five members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Electricity Oversight Board. Governor Davis has appointed the five new members of the ISO governing board pursuant to the new law. The ISO board is responsible for operating, controlling and managing the power transmission lines that deliver electricity throughout California and between neighboring states. 
This is not public information yet but, assuming Tim gives his final okay, a guy will be joining the trading floor to develop a renewable market including a portfolio, trading, an index, auction, an Enron Online product, etc.  He wants to formulate a well developed regulatory policy approach and has agreed to draft up some bullet points for our use and has had preliminary meetings with various groups in Houston including Jeff Keeler.  He also wants to enlist the assistance of government affairs.  I suggested he do a presentation at our next government affairs meeting.  Are we still having people do presentations at our meetings?  Could we fit him in? Ginger Dernehl@ENRON 01/25/2001 10:50 AM

I want verification from Tim, Chris Calger, and you that working on the RTO West tariff and generation interconnect agreement is consistent with my ""new narrower role"" as regulatory attorney for the West power desk and the apporpriate priority for use of my time.  Should I ask them now or should I 
As if we needed another reason to avoid at all costs a default at the PX: I notice that one ""Event of Default"" under Enron's EEI master agreement is an Enron Corp default on indebtedness to third parties, which results in the acceleration of obligations in excess of $100 million.  This sounds like our doomsday scenario at the PX, under which we default on a payment or chargeback, and the PX liquidates our block forward/CTS positions, which the PX values in excess of negative $100 million, and then exercises our LCs. This makes it even more imperative that we (1) avoid a default at the PX and (2) reduce our CTS collateral with the PX. 
The public power person who wrote the article Sean is discussing has always been opposed to RTO West and was just seizing another opportunity to oppose it.  The FERC staff is no less commited to RTOs, and I'm sure the IOUs are no less committed for that reason.  In addition, I doubt FERC Commissioners in the new administration will back-track on RTO formation especially because of what has happened in California (how the state took too much control of ISO formation and control).

Nice final flame! Hoecker's Last Word:Calif Must Adopt 'Realistic' Pwr Plan 01/19/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- California officials have shown ""bald disregard"" for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing short-sighted policies that will push the state's two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy, FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday. The remarks by Hoecker, who resigned as chairman effective Thursday, came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California. Hoecker lambasted Gov. Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the state's power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts. State officials ignored the commission's Dec. 15 market-restructuring order and instead embraced ""conspiracy theories, resistance to more realistic rates, and calls for palliative price caps...to obscure the issues and delay solutions,"" Hoecker said. White House-brokered negotiations to develop power-supply contracts as part of a near-term solution are at an impasse due to ""unrealistic"" demands by Gov. Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production, Hoecker said. He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at below-present-cost, pre-1996 levels. Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies, Edison International's Southern California Edison Co. (EIX) and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PCG), will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the state's flawed market-restructuring law, Hoecker said. ""Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted. If it cannot, perhaps it will force debtors, creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light, without recrimination and posturing,"" he said. ""Let's be realistic,"" Hoecker said. ""Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait: Without a reasonable, technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises, they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support

Christi said that Dan should work on this because he knows the history.  Jim approved it. Can you give me a budget amount?  Thanks. 
CalISO filed a tariff to charge scheduling coordinators FERC's annual charge.  The ISO should charge end users (transmission customers).  As you know we just got FERC to rule that marketers don't have to pay the annual charges.  Tim wants to protest.  Protests due 1/19!  Please respond ASAP.

This E-mail is about a couple of issues I thought we might start coordinating on. As I mentioned to you this morning Paul, I thought you should be aware that Craig Gannett is planning to attend the NW governor's roundtable (that you will be attending) to monitor it for Cynthia.  I just found this out yesterday.  I will not be attending. In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on recommending changes to help solve the energy crisis for the NW.  Craig has been working on this with Cynthia Sanderr and I believe has circulated this paper in draft form to some degree on the Hill.  I have not given Craig any comments on the paper as yet.

Attached find the Cal ISO's Order No. 2000 filing.  It basically proposes nothing 
I will also be in the TOA and maybe the Tariff review group.  Thanks. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
The ISO has sent us the attached letter saying that we are required to file with it (and the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB)) our reports of prices over the soft cap.  It cites to it's Amendment 33 filing as authority.  The ISO's proposed tariff did not include any such requirement, rather it asked the Commission to so order.  Although the FERC approved Amendment 33, the FERC's order on the filing makes no mention of such requirement.  I would like Dan or Ron to advise whether this allows us to avoid filing this information with the ISO and EOB. I will also be asking members of EPSA what they plan to do during the conference call tomorrow. 
The ISO appears to have taken it upon itself to get above $250/MWh costs for the month of December pursuant to the Dec 8, 2000 emergency order. Mary, Steve and I need to confirm that these data are in fact required to be reported by that Order.  (Mary, can you point me to our copy of that emergency order?) Chris,  can you run a report for December 8-31 to see what accepted bids may be reportable?  During the breakpoint was $250, not $150. Alan C.

I'd like to expand on the last point.  The Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should report that information subject to confidentiality.  Also, if contrary to our wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault.

I am back in the office.  I assume you are handling this and will let me see a copy of the draft.  Thanks. Steve Walton 01/05/2001 09:34 AM 
I have not gone over the filing in great detail, I have found one thing we may want to file to address.  All the parties except PGE/Sierra/Nevada agreed to eliminate the export fees.  PGE/Sierra/Nevada made a joint filing asking the FERC to require the RTO West to include export fees and their effect in the financial modeling of their Stage 2 filing.  I think we should consider filing comments  to oppose this requiest from PGE/Sierra/Nevada for the following reasons: Elimination of the export fees is a positive step to resolve one of the three major ""seams"" issues.  With RTO West taking the lead, the other RTOs (CAISO & DSTAR) can follow suit. The nature and type of export fee to be used would have to be developed. This eat up an enormous amount of time on a speculative fee which the majority of the parties are opposed to including.  The delay engendered and use of limited resources is unconsiounable. We can reiterate our concerns regarding allocation of rights instead of an auction and about the potential exclusion of facilities from the RTO West control.  The December 1st filing really doesn't change those things.  Since the comments are due on the 16th and I will be gone all next week, I thought I had better let you know my views before leaving. I am including the IPP/Marketers comments for reference. Steve 
According to the guys on the desk, EPMI has 5-10 end user customers in Montana (for example Smurfit, Stone and others).

At the FERC Commission meeting this morning, Chairman Hoecker announced his resignation from the Commission effective January 18. Other Items at the Meeting: Hoecker summarized the meetings that occurred last night with Cal. Gov. Davis, Energy Sec. Richardson, Clinton Administration officials and industry representatives.  He said that the parties had produced a statement of principles on resolving the Calif. issues.  Specifically, he mentioned that the principles include a discussion of the regional nature of the market. Order on GridFlorida.   When GridFlorida made its RTO filing, they asked the Commission for an expedited order providing guidance on certain independence and governance matters.  This order provides guidance on: The process for selecting the RTO board The process for selecting a CEO and directors Rules for financial holdings by RTO board members. Items Struck form Agenda:  The Commission did not act on Illinois Power's requests to leave the Midwest ISO or the Alliance second RTO  filing. Commissioner Massey criticized the Commission for being slow to act on these items.  He said that at the heart of both of these filings is the issue of scope/configuration of RTOs.   He shared his belief that the Midwest must be treated on a regional basis. El Paso v. CPUC complaint.  This proceeding involves CPUC's complaint that affiliate El Paso Merchant is improperly hoarding El Paso Natural Gas capacity to California.   The Commission did not discuss the draft order. However, Hebert noted that he had dissented from the order. 
Based on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market transactions with the FERC and should not question the ISO about their reporting out-of-market transactions for the following reasons: Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was not artfully written.  Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information necessary for refunds. We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more liquid.  As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals will not be achieved. Nor will the Commission's goal of moving volumes out of the spot market be achieved if parties can simply withhold from the spot market and sell 
The west desk also supports these comments. 
FYI re: a Duke/Enron answer to APS' reply to our protest.  I will forward Arizona PS's reply to Steve, and Mary.  Alan and Bob, let me know if you would like to see it. 
See comments below.  Sorry this is so delayed.  Thanks. teresabrown@duke-energy.com on 01/02/2001 01:22:39 PM 
Christi, Attached are comments Gretchen generated regarding APS' answer to our joint protest of APS' interconnection procedures.  We are considering filing a reply, and I wanted to get your input.  Generally, DENA does not like to file answers to answers as it is in FERC's discretion whether to accept such responses, but we may want to consider clarifying our position regarding the monthly direct assignment charges under Article 12 of the IA. Please let me know your take. Best Regards, Teresa Brown (713) 627-6592 We've taken a look at the answer Arizona Public Service Company filed on 12/22/00 in response to our protest.  There are a number of issues to which DENA should consider responding.  Responses must be filed by Monday, January 8, 2001. *    Study assumptions (APS Answer, at 8-9):  APS argues that there is no benefit from disclosing assumptions and that this would give a generator an unfair market advantage over other market participants.  While APS does not indicate to whom there is no benefit, presumably it means APS.  We should consider challenging this since there is a benefit to disclosure of the study assumptions -- how else is a generator to determine whether it is being asked to goldplate APS' system?  APS' answer to this is to say that the IA's Willful Action provisions prevent APS from conducting activities or making decisions based on motive to serve financial benefit.  We are at a loss, however, as to how the provisions accomplish that since what they really do is shield APS from liability.I agree -- and agree that APS' response doesn't make sense.  I believe that the Commission has required Entergy to provide more study data to a generator in one of last year's complaints against Entergy (either Dynegy or NRG?). **What about a response on the ""must -run"" issue (p. 27-28).  I think APS is trying to back door the Arizona proposed requirements (that are still being fought and are not accepted?)  This is a big issue and APS' response does not address our arguments other than stating that Must Run should be required in the IA.  I do not know of any other interconnection agreements that have must-run provisions. *    Transmission credits (APS Answer, at 30-31):  APS claims that transmission credits are appropriate only for firm service, a proposition the Commission just rejected in the ComEd order issued on 12/8/00.Absolutely agree that it should be for firm and non-firm. *    Monthly Direct Assignment Charges (APS Answer, at 32-33):  We should consider clarifying our position on this issue, which APS appears to misunderstand. APS argues that, in our protest, we addressed the cost of modifications, not the cost of operation and maintenance, and thus were comparing apples to oranges.  This is not true.  Rather, what we argued is that we should not be responsible for the cost of operating and maintaining any facilities for which we were not responsible for the initial installation cost.  APS apparently missed the point.I agree. *    Willful Action (APS Answer, at 33-37):  APS essentially argues that the strict liability provisions in the IA are appropriate because it cannot make a profit by entering into an IA.  Unlike with respect to transmission service, it recovers only its actual costs.  APS  ignores the fact that, by interconnecting a generator, APS will ultimately generate transmission revenue.  APS also ignores the benefits that new generation bring to the table.   APS has not justified why the liability provisions are ""consistent with, or superior to"" the pro forma tariff and why a generator should be required to bear the consequences of APS' negligence and, in many instances, intentional misconduct, particularly where APS is not provided any incentive to act prudently, simply because APS receives no profit.I agree.  APS' proposed restrictions are wholly unwarranted and are outrageous.  There are no other interconnection agreements (that I know of) containing anything remotely similar. Please let us know how you'd like to proceed.  If you have any questions, let us know.  Thanks. Gretchen

Shouldn't we protest this filing at FERC?  Otherwise we'll have to track on a day-to-day basis whether we should sell to the ISO. Alan Comnes 01/08/2001 02:38 PM 
This ISO amendment was issued on 1/4/01 but I am not sure if anything was circulated to folks on the Trading Desk. The amendment allows the ISO to relax creditworthiness requirements to the utilities on a day to day basis.  A copy of the transmittal letter is attached. The ISO has been invoking its order this week.  See notice issued for tomorrow, below. If you have questions regarding this amendment, please do not hesitate to call me. Alan Comnes Daily Notification For January  9, 2001, Pursuant to Amendment 36 of CAISO Tariff Pursuant to Section 2.2.3.2 of the ISO Tariff, as amended on January 4, 2001 (Amendment 36), effective for Trading Day January  9, 2001, Utility Distribution Companies that are Original Participating Transmission Owners and Scheduling Coordinators for such Utility Distribution Companies shall not be subject to the Trading Limitations specified in Section 2.2.7.3 of the ISO Tariff.

A nurse will be at our office on Friday, January 12, to administer flu shots to employees/spouses from 1 - 2 p.m. in Mt. Adams, as described in the EBS announcement below. 
Please handle this.  Call me with any questions. 
provided by the ISO to the CPUC Mary, Any direction you can provide on how to handle would be appreciated.  I think any response is due 1/10. GAC 
provided by the ISO to the CPUC Here is another one.  Pklant to send any letters re this one -- mary hain had done so in the past, I believe. 
provided by the ISO to the CPUC Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: On December 19 the CPUC received a second Public Record Act request for information provided by the ISO to the CPUC which may include information subject to ISO tariff section 20.3.  This request was forwarded to the ISO today by the CPUC.  Attached please find the Public Record Act request and the letter from the CPUC providing that any comments from the ISO regarding the request must be submitted to the CPUC by no later than January 10, 2001.

- Addition of City of Vernon as PTO 
Typically the traders are not interested in changes to the TAC because it i= s=20 paid by the end-user not by us.  However, EES folks (Dennis Benevides, Neil= =20 Bresnan, and Jubron Whelan) are usually interested and you can copy the=20 traders with an FYI if you want to.

No we're not interested in intervening.  This filing is to carry out the settlement I negotiated.  I'm the person on the floor who is familiar with the services we purchase. Alan Comnes 12/21/2000 02:21 PM 
Lysa, Please view the attachment and download the BPA tariff filing to the p: drive and let me know where it is.  If you have trouble downloading fromt the FERC site, try BPA (my guess is that it will be easier to get from BPA than through FERC). This can wait until next week. Thank you, Alan Comnes 
Apparently BPA is filing for new transmission and A/S  rates effective 10/1/01.  Is there an interest in: intervening? (I assume no) getting a copy of the filing? (I assume yes) Who on our floor is familar with the BPA transmission and A/S services we currently purchase? Alan Comnes 
FYI 
Brian McCellan from PacifiCorp Transmission called this morning to let me know that as of 1/1/2001 that Pac has begun charging for losses for transmission schedules using Non-Firm and Short Term transmission service. The losses will be .045 percent of the schedule. Pac offers the option of either settling losses financially or physically. The consensus is that Enron will settle losses financially using a index price, that Pac will supply, based on the Mid-Columbia, COB,4C and PV indexes. Currently Mary Hain has the official declaration form showing Enron is selecting financial settlements vs. physical. Until Mary returns and has the declaration executed I have notified Brain that Enron will settle losses financially. Regards, Les Rawson 
I wished to review the filing (especially the TOA) and comment along the=20 lines we have before.  Unfortunately, I did not have time to read the filin= g=20 before leaving for vacation.  I left the filing on my desk.  Hope you had a= =20 happy holiday.

Yes please.  Thanks. Alan Comnes 12/21/2000 06:58 PM 
Lysa, My new desk is very narrow but very deep. I think it would be good to have a low book shelf up against the back to maximize my ability to store stuff. Otherwise, this space is going to drive me nuts.   Can you do some looking around the floor or in a catalog? Mary, would you like something like this too? 
Charles, I'm sorry I've taken so long to get back to you on this.  Since I didn't have time to analyze your paper, please see the attached paper on the release of information in an RTO.  Also, talk to Alan, I think he provided further support for our recommendations in an affidavit he filed at FERC. Also, please work with Alan about your comments on page 5.  Alan, if you respond through E-mails please copy me.  Thanks. 
Charles--You may want to get more public power, and industrial groups on this.  Also, you may want to check with Sarah or Joe about scheduling a pre-filing meeting with FERC. Mary--You may want to check what is said about the Cal power market in this (in C. on p. 5).  OK with you? Charles Yeung 12/07/2000 02:19 PM 
I wanted all Regional Reliabilty Council reps to have a copy of this document which Enron is supporting for the FERC ANOPR filing. Please contact me if you have any questions. Charles Yeung 713-853-0348 
Lloyd and Aleck, thank you both for the info re: Gen data, I will keep that and interject it in the debates. I have been working with Kurt Conger of American Public Power Assoc on a pro-Gen status disclosure paper.  This paper will be proposed to the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative for inclusion in the response to the FERC OASIS Phase II ANOPR. Southern Company Mktg is leading the charge to prevent disclosure of such data.  This fight is lining up as those marketers with large gen assets vs. those who don't. Transmission customer reps on NERC committees and subcommittees working independently outside the NERC process cannot agree on a pro or con position however, many support putting these 2 arguments in front of FERC for action. I will push for filing both the pro and con positions to be filed in the ANOPR response. 
Attached is the position paper in support of generator run status disclosure.  The file format is MS Word 97.  If you have difficulty reading the file, I can send copies in Acrobat PDF format upon request. Kurt Conger EXS Inc.

Joe Attached find the report you requested.  Alan - Governor Davis offered a highly discounted forward contract ($45-50/MWh) at the FERC settlement conference today.  As usual, California is trying to get its refund with or without FERC requiring it.  Alan - Tim and Joe will likely need your assistance with this settlement negotiation. 
I agree with Sue.  In fact, I don't even think we need to intervene given that the ISO did not file a tariff that would become effective.  So unless Tim wants to help out the ISO with a supportive filing . . . . Susan J Mara@ENRON 12/18/2000 11:05 PM 
and the Market Surveillance Committee I think we might want to make a neutral or supportive intervention -- because we can expect the Hogan forces to come blaring in and we may need to do something then.  Especially since my understanding is that the report is pretty suppportive of our views. 
Is there anything we can do to address circumstances where we are required to bid into the ISO pursuant to the DOE's Section 202(c) order - especially for the fixed price customers? Steve C Hall 12/18/2000 05:46 PM 
For your review: Under this rider, service customers selling energy to EPMI at an indexed price would be required to reimburse EPMI for any FERC-ordered refunds or short payments due to a credit default at the PX/ISO.  Customers selling for a fixed price would not be subject to these prior adjustments because the customers have no expectation that EPMI will necessarily sell into California. 
Please review attached letter to customers ASAP.  Make sure you copy Steve Hall on your comments. 
The following are  some  notes and questions regarding FERC's December 15= =20 Order intended to supplement Mary's notes distributed over the weekend. 1. Penalty on Underscheduled Load=20 a.

We have put together the following list of issues for the request for rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001. We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit $150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?) Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts. The FERC should clarify its statement that ""to the extent the IOUs' resources exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules.""  A literal interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options but we are concerned about less liquidity. Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs. We oppose the 27-month refund period We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF) The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being

Cool Christmas gift!  Thank you.  Attached is my feeble attempt at returning the favor. 
I'd like to set up a call for this afternoon to discuss the FERC's order, in general.  Also, in an hour or so I'll also be forwarding a proposed issue list on rehearing so we can talk about it. Lysa Akin 12/18/2000 09:53 AM 
I got your message after I sent you this update.  I sent a note to everyone I contacted, advising the call would not take place. Mary Hain 12/18/2000 09:52 AM 
Jim says he doesn't want to have a conference call yet. Lysa Akin 12/18/2000 09:26 AM 
regarding the call you asked me to set up: Jim is is DC with Rick and Steve.  Marcia is paging him to see if he is available at 2:30pm Central/3:30pm Eastern I left a message wither Bernadette to call me back regarding Joe and Sarah's availability at 3:30pm Eastern Jeff indicated is he available at 12:30 Pacific. I left a message w/Sue asking if she can make it at 12:30pm. Maureen advised that Steve might be able to make it at 3:30pm Eastern, so I will make sure she has all the info so that she can page him. I left a message for Richard to call me back 
FYI. Today we received the attached letter forwarded by Gary Fergus (our attorney on the California Attorney General investigation) from the California Attorney General.  This letter is a protocol for retaining electronic evidence. 
Yes we do care.  The question is: are we going to do anything?  Robin and Richard will be discussing this this afternoon. The CPUC's motion only applied to the generators, not the ISO.  I guess the ISO was viewed as cooperating. Susan J Mara@ENRON 12/13/2000 09:56 AM 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas -- FOR YOUR INFORMATION The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a court tells them not to.  DO we care about this? Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC-- given the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info? Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC claims identify those who have abused market power. 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO Tariff section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly, the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20 unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4 which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in the past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an outage and projected in service date since this information could be used by Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current requests.

FYI 
As I mentioned on the phone, SCE moved FERC (in the FERC docket investigati= ng=20 the California market) for a subpoena to produce information from the ISO's= =20 Market Surveillance Committee.  In particular, SCE is requesting informatio= n=20 that the MSC referenced in its December 4, 2000 report to the FERC, wherein= =20 it stated that ""MSC stands ready to provide the Commission with what we=20 suspect are instances of the exercise of significant market power by specif= ic=20 market participants.

I'm not sure whether we want Hoecker to make the fourth point.  What do others think? 
We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments?

CRECers, Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline transportation to the CA border.

I'm sure we have many other specific concerns (and I am reviewing the amended supplemental compliance filing as I'm sure you are).  However, I think our key concern is returning to a stakeholder process.  Since the utilities first filing, we haven't been allowed to be at the table.  This violates Order No. 2000.

Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today: How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price? I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.

The following is an excerpt from a FERC order issued on Friday: ""Ridgewood Power LLC (Ridgewood) filed comments suggesting that the shortage of supply could be remedied in part by relaxing the operating efficiency and other regulatory requirements pertaining to Qualifying Facilities (QFs). Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 MW are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the remainder from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs). Ridgewood states that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is underutilized because of operating efficiency and other QF requirements. With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that these underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak and off-peak periods.  Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 MWs would be immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing utility or into the competitive market their ""above-baseline"" output for a limited time period.   Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency standards......... Section 292.205(c) of the Commission's regulations provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency standards ""upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy savings"".   However, the Commission has exercised its waiver authority in a number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill PURPA's goals.   We find that many of these same factors are present here. Consistent with the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver in this circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the Cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through increasing the availability of needed capacity.  Therefore, we will grant temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration QFs for sales into California, effective as of the date of this order.  We

Here are my corrections/concerns/questions about the EPMI portion of the filing. We need to coordinate this with PGE and Enron Wind and make sure they file to revise their tariffs and agree to the change of the code of conduct.  Are you handling that Sarah or do you want me to? The filing and tariff do not include the Commission approved FTR sales into California, that needs to be added. Do we have any idea how close the SEC is to ruling?  It's my recollection that FERC does not like indefinite notice periods, as we have requested, nor, under their rules, do they permit a notice period of longer than 120 days. 
Thanks for your prompt response! Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Please ignore the transfer payment example I sent earlier in the day.  When we were unable to talk on the phone, I kept working on the example and added panels to show each step in the process.   I have also prepared a short note to describe the pricing provisions of the Transmission Operating Agreement which trigger the transfer payments.  The spreadsheet has notes which explain the process.  It also assumes that a volumetric export fee is not added. Hopefully we can find a time to talk about these documents to make sure I have communitcated the issue. Steve 
Looks fine. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Looks fine to me.  Sorry it took me so long to respond but I'm in D.C. until tomorrow. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
I want these two issues raised in our protest of RTO West.  I don't care how 
On 10/27/00, FERC issued two orders that clarify procedures for requesting long term transmission.  (Morgan Stanley v. Ill. Powerand Tenaska Power v. SPP).  In both cases, the customer requested long term (year or greater) transmission service and in both cases, the ATC was insufficient to award the entire request.  Transmission Providers, Ill. Power and SPP treated partial service differently.  In these orders FERC holds: A transmission provider (TP) is NOT required to offer short term service in response to a long term request.  Section 19.7 of the pro forma OATT only obligates the TP to tell the customer how much partial Long Term service could be provided.  Examples: -- Customer requests 300 MW long term transmission service for one year.  TP replies that it can offer 200 MW for the entire year. -- Customer requests 2 year service for 300 MW.  TP replies that it can offer 300 MW for one year. -- Customer requests 300 MW for one year.  TP can only provide 300 MW for summer months.  TP is NOT obligated to provide customer the 3 months service.  Furthermore, an annual request for 300 for some months and 0 MW for others is NOT a valid long term request.  What Customer is then doing is really submitting a short term request for 300 for summer only -- a new short term request must be submitted to obtain the summer transmission. While the TP is not required to respond with short term availability in response to a long term request, FERC did footnote to Ill. Power that it thinks it is a helpful idea for the TP to alert the customer to what ATC is available so the customer can submit a short term request if it wishes. 
Diana - are you tracking this? 
Can you get a positive upside over the costs for next summer at least?  Also, we think that in order to set up a load only control area, you have to have firm transmission paths to generation sources (but if you  want to pursue this, I need to pull the NERC rules on that issue to be certain of the requirements.  We only set up generation only control areas.  Mary, the 6 or so requirements are on the NERC web site.)  thanks. Mary Hain 11/03/2000 11:11 AM 
We wouldn't be a generation only control area.  Our load is Valley Electric. My bigger worry is how do we meet our generation requirement if we sell off LV Cogen.  Also, when the RTO forms, all control areas will be consolidated, at least if their transmission is in RTO West. 
Can you and Sean Crandall call me about this?  There have been a variety of problems with the full use of the sink provision based on FERC's Entergy order.  Also, ComEd and TVA have precluded us from sinking at the generation only control area and FERC hotline has said this can be done without a FERC filing (or at least we would have to pursue it in a complaint--we don't want that result in a FERC order.)  In addition, while you were on vacation, Nevada Power had the problem with Salt River Project.  I don't know the status of that.  I am in a room reviewing etrans tariff, so page me if you want to talk about it.  800-778-8365.  Thanks.

Usually, ENA legal hires outside counsel, but I'd be happy to assist you and outside counsel on it.  I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of  Bracewell and Patterson for one project.  Power marketers proposals are tariff filings for market-based rates under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  The Commission has 60 days to accept them from the date FERC notices the filing in the Federal Register or the filing is deemed accepted.  EWG applications are made under Section 32 of the Public Utiluty Holding Company Act.  Thereunder, the Commission must make an EWG determination within 60 days of its receipt of an EWG application. Alan Larsen 11/02/2000 02:01 PM 
Mary-- I have several ""new guy"" questions for you.  How do we prefer to take care of the required FERC filings for Market Based Rate Authorization and for EWG status in connection with power plant developments?  I ask this in the context of the PSCo project, where we have a project LLC as the development vehicle, and we anticipate selling the LLC before commercial operation. Specifically, do we do this in-house with govt. affairs people, through Enron DC office people, through outsside counsel for the project, through outside counsel not otherwise affiliated with the project, or otherwise? And, when do we  usually do the filings? Thanks. Al Larsen 
Attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the CPUC's proposal for load based price caps.  Obviously, these arguments would also apply to the ISO Board's recent decision. 
Thanks! 
This report is accurate.  For a variety of reasons, CFE (exports to Mexico) went to zero.  I agree with the export number to Canada.  If anyone wants to know about Mexico, call me, and I'll fill you in on all of the changes they made! 
Would you review this?  Thanks! 
Attached  is EPMI's 3rd quarter WSPP report for your review and comments, Wright & Talisman request that we submit our filing electronically  by Friday, October 27. Thanks Linda 
Hi Folks!  For 3rd quarter we'll need to undergo an examination of our reporting requirements for WSPP and accordingly, our reporting processes. The filing requirements can be found under the "" WSPP Library"" heading of the Current Documents section of the WSPP home page (www.wspp.org). Basically, we just need to be confident our reports are accurate and we also need to be cognizant that if we make significant changes, we should be able to anticipate the impact of those changes and send appropriate adjusting notification if necessary.  Let's not surprise ourselves or FERC in a big way! I'm not sure that I am the appropriate staff to head this up, but will be happy to provide organization and coordination to the effort until we all are happy with the undertaking. Next week after the close of this month is complete, I will structure a project management file on the WSPP reporting and we'll take it from there. Please contact me with comments, questions, complaints, x7756. P.S. We have filed the 2nd quarter report using the unchanged method.

NERC is considering changing its policy 1 for control areas.  If you wish to see the proposed changes please see below.  If you wish to participate in Enron's comments on these changes please send your comments to Richard Ingersoll, Charles Yeung and Keith Comeaux. The Performance Subcommittee (PS) has completed its review of Policy 1, ""Generation Control and Performance,"" and has posted it for a 45-day public comment period. Also posted for comment are the following documents: 
I have tracked down an old memo written by the Chief Counsel of Federal Affairs for Niagara Mohawk, summarizing positions taken in requests for rehearing of Order No. 888 to close the bypass loophole.  She discusses how there would be many efforts to municipalize utilities' distribution systems in New York and how NiMo would be meeting with the FERC Staff to tell them how much money they might lose if they couldn't figure out a way to recover these costs.  Maybe whoever is researching this should focus on FERC cases involving New York utilities. 
I needed a response!! Thanks. Mary Hain 10/10/2000 06:53 PM 
I think I know what you're talking about.  I know you weren't asking for a response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted Order No. 888 and 888-A (without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases). In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee. Par. 31,036 at 31,797.  So in general, customers can't avoid paying for stranded costs simply by bypassing.  FERC allowed utilities to file for recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before July 11, 1994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery.  Id. at 31,810. There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass.  For contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a stranded cost provision.  However, in that case, the utility could seek to recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve.  Id. at note 679.  Accordingly, the customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission service. If the loophole does not apply (because the contract does not have such a notice provision), the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section 206 proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable, wherein the customer would have the burden of proof.  But, if they do, the incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost recovery but it must do so in that customer's Section 206 proceeding.  Order No. 888-A, Par 31,049 at 30,400.  Likewise, if the utility has already filed for recovery of stranded costs, the customer must make any Section 206 claim in that case.  Id. The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred costs.  However, FERC will only entertain requests to recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required. Order No. 888 at 31,824-25.  I don't know anything about what the individual states have done. I hope this helps. 
Sarah and I will check on this because Enron did some research on it several years ago.  However, the commercial people would like to market this possibly to others, not simply wholesale customers.  What happens at the retail level on stranded costs?  Thanks. Robert Frank@ENRON 10/10/2000 01:59 PM 
This is a FERC issue because its would involve wholesale stranded costs.  Joe and Sarah will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Order 888 provides that if the muni (or other wholesale customer) is able to bypass the transmission facilities of its former provider (and I believe there is dispute over what constitutes bypass) then they may be able to avoid stranded cost liability. 
8. Q. Provide cumulative transaction volumes (million of Mwh) of electricity (by calendar quarter) for 1999 and 2000. A.  EES transactions are included in EPMI transaction volumes. Volumes for WSCC for 2000 are as follows: 1st qrtr 29,619 2nd qtr 44,617 3rd qtr 87,708

Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials ""agent"" when buying an industrial's excess power to insert into the grid.  Generally, an industrial would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 60 days) in order to sell into the grid.  EPMI and EES have not requested the ""Impower"" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know). If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings.  (Also, Enron generally has to also file for ""EWG"" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not required.) I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made. 
On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking 
This is getting rediculous.  Twenty four hours notice is simply not sufficient time to give us the notice required by the tariff.  Given the current barrage of data requests and confidentiality requests I hadn't even had time to read your E-mail when it was past time to respond.  Accordingly, Mike Day will be sending to FERC a request for confidential treatment. 
Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: The California ISO has received the attached request for data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the context of FERC's Bulk Power Investigation (the nationwide fact-finding probe of electric markets and recent price spikes).  To the extent the request includes a request for information that is listed in ISO tariff section 20.3.2., the ISO will seek confidential treatment for such information pursuant to 18 C.F.R. 388.112. Any concerns relating to the data request should be communicated by noon on Friday, October 6 to Jeanne Sole at 916-608-7144 and jsole@caiso.com and copied to Beth Ann Burns at bburns@caiso.com, Charlie Robinson at crobinson@caiso.com and Norma Formanek at nformanek@fbm.com.

Concerning your Data Request to Generators #2, I believe this question was sent to us in error.  Enron Power Marketing does not own any generation in California, so these questions do not apply.  Please let me know if I have read the question incorrectly. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Per our phone call, here's one of the E-mails. 
Brian - I''ll be on vacation next week so if you have any questions, please call my counterpart in Houston, Christi Nicolay.  Her E-mail address is above.  Her phone number is (713) 853-7007. Christi will be pulling together the answer to data request number 8 for you for just the WSCC.  Christi - Chris is your contact person here to make sure the numbers are correct. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Since you only wanted information for the WSCC, do you want the answer to number 8 to be corrected to only include information for the WSCC? We don't have any information here about Enron Winds' generators.  I have forwarded your data requests to the following people at Enron Wind who I hope will be able to help you:  John Lamb, Michael Payne, and Hap Boyd.  Their addresses are: Michael Payne/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Hap Boyd/EWC/Enron@Enron, John Lamb/EWC/Enron@ENRON Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
I'm sending you a series of E-mails from FERC asking for responses to data requests.  Please read them and call me with any questions: 503-464-8862 
Many thanks! Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
I asked Chris to forward you this information in response to data request Number 8.  As I mentioned, before EPMI requests confidential treatment of this information.  This information is for the entire United States, not for the Western interconnect.  Please let us know if you need this information for just the Western Interconnect.  I will be in Washington DC for the next few days so if you need to reach me call me on my cell phone at 503-807-0929. 
Attached find Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services' responses to the Staff's data requests in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Bulk Power Investigation.  These responses assumes that you sent separate data requests to Enron Wind, so they do not include that information.  The answers also assume you are requesting this information for California (and therefore the Western interconnect) only.  Please let me know if these assumptions are incorrect. If you were requesting Eastern Interconnect information you need to contact Chrisit Nicolay at the above E-mail address.  Enron requests confidential treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Section 388.112.  Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable to respond to question 8 and to provide the Unit Identifier requested in question 4.  We hope to be able to provide this information on Monday. Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-8862.  I will be traveling on 
You requested the publicly available information underlying our slides, so you could independently verify Enron's conclusions.  If you have any other questions please call me. 
Mary: The public data sources that we routinely use for historical, realtime and forecast hydroelectric data are: http://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil This site is operated by the Northwest Division of the US Army Corp of Engineers, and includes both historical and near-realtime water and power data for all Corp Columbia basin projects, as well as major USBR projects and non-federal mid-Columbia plants; http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov This site is operated by the Northwest River Forecast Center. It includes both assessments of current Columbia basin streamflow conditions and forecasts of future conditions; http://www.mp.usbr.gov This is a Bureau of Reclamation site that publishes current data and forecasts for California's Central Valley Project (CVP) plants; http://www.uc.usbr.gov  This is a Bureau of Reclamation site that publishes data and forecasts for Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) plant water releases and power production; http://h2o.usgs.gov  This is a Geological Survey site that publishes near-realtime data from automated streamflow gages, and http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/ This is a site operated by the University of Washington that provides convenient access to historical Columbia River and tributary water data. Of these, the sites most relevant to recent markets are probably the Corp' Northwest Division site, which offers enough near-realtime generation data to directly account for 75% to 80% of Columbia River energy production, and the River Forecast Center, which provides snowpack-driven, long range volume runoff forecasts. The CVP data are a helpful index of California hydro conditions, but only represent about 10% of the state's installed hydro capacity. Please forward this information to appropriate FERC staff. 
Paul - Here's the paper I mentioned.  Sue could you update this for Paul? 
Here is a document I put together a long time ago that lays out Tim's stated positions in various FERC proceedings in which EPMI has interevened.  Bear in mind that Sue intervened in some of these cases to protect EES's interest.

I am going to be the Senior Regulatory Counsel at ISO New England starting on April 9, 2001.   My last day in the Portland area will be March 31, 2001.  I enjoyed working with you and wish you the best of everything.  My new address will be: Mary Hain Senior Regulatory Counsel ISO New England Inc. One Sullivan Road Holyoke, MA  01040-2841 (413) 535-4000 
Effective April 6, 2001, I am resigning my position as Director of Federal Regulatory Affairs with Enron Corp.  It has been a pleasure working with you.  I will be working today and will be on vacation for the remainder of the time.  During my vacation, next week, I can be reached at home at (503) 
FYI 
On 3/14/01, FERC granted EPMI and Duke's request for rehearing of Arizona Public Service interconnection procedures: APS is required to specify a time in the interconnection process after which a generator is no longer subject to additional studies (we pointed out the VEPCO limitation that no further studies are required after the Interconnection Agreement is signed or filed unsigned at FERC). APS is required to include in its procedures the study criteria (for example, Form 715) that it uses for system impact studies. These changes are helpful as FERC continues to build on previous orders in other utilities' interconnection procedure dockets. 
Congrats and best of luck always!  It couldn't happen to a nicer guy. 
I assume you didn't see this because of the fire wall, so I'm resending. 
Jay--Couple notes: FERC has stated in several orders what it considers ""material changes"".  You may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok with the interpretations.  Those are some of the orders that I would look to should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change. Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on ""commenced construction.""  What I mean by ""commenced"" includes the utility purchase of easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the costs.  [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC decision.]]  Thanks. 
Is an RCR still necessary since Sue said Ron is doing this for Richard?  Tell me when you see me tomorrow. 
Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego 
I E-mailed it to you.  Didn't you get it.? 
I think we should do this but should include some comments praising FERC for taking some positive actions and really looking for solutions instead of simply ways to reregulate (thank you again Dan Yergin).

Mary, Thanks.  Can you give me some contact names at PGE.  I know Peggy Fowler but who does FERC and RTO stuff? Alan Mary Hain 03/15/2001 04:47 PM 
In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as follows: Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard Sanders should be responsible for the coordination. 
Please draft an RCR for me on this.  Thanks. 
please put on calendar 
I'm fine with this.  The only other legal point you might make is that the request for longer than 60 days is a collateral attack on the FERC's December 15 order, and an issue that (if memory serves) is already before the FERC on rehearing. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

As I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection  (e.g., the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to ""Transmission Service"" not interconnection service)  Although I haven't done a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6, 7.3, and 11.  Also ""transmission service"" should be capitalized. Some Other suggestions: Preamble - Sentence three - delete: ""[t]hese Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System.""  Insert: ""These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of

It's been a few years since I reviewed the case law on this.  Perhaps you should write a memo reviewing the FERC cases on this issue and if necessary, go talk to FERC about whether an RFP will be sufficient to set a just and reasonable rate.

Looks fine to me. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI wants to submit an offer on.  PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for 50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North.  Offers are due by March 28 and PGE has until April 5, 2001 to accept . I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.  I have also told him that EPMI could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's favor.  I would recommend the former.  Ron - would you tell me how much you would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,  in the event PGE accepts our offer?  Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing.  Is that

I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy 
PG&E asked the FERC to establish cost-based pricing for all sales into California, and until the FERC makes a final determination on whether rates are just and reasonable, to subject all sales to a cost-based refund condition.

Sue and Joe: don't you think we shoul= d=20 submit an RCR to have Ron do some research on the surrounding issues?  Here= =20 are a few that came to mind. (1) What jurisdiction does FERC have over a state-owned transmission system= =20 (especially in light of Order No. 2000 and the governance of the Cal ISO on= =20 file at FERC)? (2) Is there anything FERC can do to stop the conveyance (e.g., since the= =20 utilities would have to file a Section 203 filing for approval to convey th= e=20 assets, what basis would be available to argue that conveyance was not in t= he=20 public interest.)  Should Joe explore with Hebert the Commission's=20 willingness to fight with the State about this? (3) If the State had the utilities operate the transmission system, subject= =20 to the State's control, would that comply with Order No. 2000? =20 Susan J Mara@ENRON 02/20/2001 01:32 PM

SBX 33 passed off of the Senate floor on a vote of 24-14.  The vote was along straight party lines.  The following are some of the key comments made during the debate.  Senators are identified by party affiliation. The Senate did not take up SBX 6. Sen. Morrow (R):  This bill is like a partial birth abortion  - we never gave the market a chance to work right.  It=01,s the generators who are getting the raw deal. Sen. McClintock (R):  Of the all the choices the Administration could choose to resolve this crisis, they are choosing two of the worst, to raise rates and to ensure blackouts.  LADWP is the biggest price gouger of them all so there is no reason to believe a public power authority will be better.  I would support a public power authority only to build new generation. Sen. Kuehl (D) :  The free market works only if we can say =01&no=018 to th= e product =01) can=01,t say no to energy.  Acquiring transmission lines gives the state control over the provision of energy. Sen. Scott (D) :  Reliant is spending $300 million to name a dome after itself.  My district has 3 MUD=01,s who rejected deregulation and the ratepayers are happy. Sen. Bowen (D) The only question is how much of a premium we=01,ll have to pay for bureaucracy to run the system.  Would you prefer to be gouged by unbridled market power and name stadiums in faraway places or have checks and balances? Sen. Haynes (R):  If we don=01,t get more power, we=01,re just rearranging = the deck chairs on the Titanic.  Regulatory burdens prevent companies from building in CA.  Do we want to use public dollars or private dollars to build generation.  More government won=01,t get rid of the shortage while letting more entrepreneurial money in will create a buyers market. Sen. Peace (D):  The Houston cartel with their protectors at FERC are in a wholesale attack on CA ratepayers.  Removing price caps, fixing the ISO and PX and encouraging more retail competition won=01,t fix the wholesale market.  Our constituents are threatened because FERC won=01,t do its job.  Those who didn=01,t play by the rules are responsible for this. Reliant insists that CA indemnify them from lawsuits =01) these people know they were charging illegal rates and they would lose lawsuits.  These bills are the only choice the kidnapers have given us.  Vote for it or raise the lone star flag over the Capitol. Sen Alarcon (D):  When I was on the L.A. City Council some of these same private companies wanted to buy LADWP.  Their goal is to eliminate all public power. Sen Burton (D):  If we have our own peaker power then Reliant and Enron would gladly sell us the rest of our power needs.  They are robber barons and we have no sympathy for them 
Let's promote it in all these groups, just to be on the safe side. Steve Walton 02/20/2001 09:06 AM 
Alan, I agree that we need to raise this issue in scheduling, ancillary services and congestion management content groups.  In those groups we would be selling the concept.  Actual implementation of the provisions would be in the tariff content group, where the actual requirements would be codified.  This way it will be blessed by FERC and built into all operating protocols. Steve Alan Comnes 02/18/2001 01:17 PM 
Steve, Mary, Where in the RTO West process should Enron make its pitch for information transparency?  To me, it would be part of the scheduling / ancillary services work group and part of congestion managment.  I am assuming we do not want to leave it to Makret Monitoring because to get information release in real-time or near-real-time requires that information release systems get built into the actual RTO operational systems. At some point, we need to weigh in and try to get information release built into the Stage 2 filings. Thanks, Alan 
This sounds like an issue we should be coordinating with the East desk too. 
Alan, While an open season is useful, I am not sure we need to require it in all instances.  If a developer of a generation project needs to build transmission to get its energy to market, they should be allowed to build it and get FTRs.  This presumes that the builder will have to negotiate the obstacle course associated with construction (environmental, reliability, and other siting approvals).  There are currently so many safeguards in place and building is so difficult, that any requirement for open season may well be generated when you try to use scarce right of way to build less than an optimal line.  This is exactly the debate going on in this committee, so as you say, the devil will reside at details.com. Steve Alan Comnes 02/20/2001 09:33 AM 
Steve, Mary: Other than stating that the ""devil is in the details,"" I am not sure I found this that illuminating. Can I assume that we support giving whoever invests in transmission, any identifiable capacity (via FTRs) created by the expansion?  I also assume any expansion may need an open season type procedure to make sure the expansion is broadly distributed to prevent monopoly power .... GAC

Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts until FERC does an audit.  It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts back to the generators first.  It also claims that the PX could not suspend its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.  It asks the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero. I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and (2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed in the auction. Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it? What is the significance of setting the market clearing price at zero? 
Please start drafting the intervention, as you've described and send me an estimate for the RCR. 
Attached please find two new Notices of Filing in Docket Nos. EL01-33 and EL01-34.  One is a request for a cease and desist order, the other a request for suspension of the underscheduling penalty.

Tim said you were having a problem using our harvester to get companys/entities' ATC that aren't complying with FERC's OASIS requirements. Tim suggested that I help you resolve this.  Could you make me a list of companies/entities that aren't complying?  Then we could discuss how to address the problem with each company/entity. Tim suggested that, to the extent we want companies to comply, we could call them and ask them to comply.  If they don't I suggested we could call the 
site 
Tim alerted everyone about this.  It's just an average for each number. 
The following are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement. In the sixth ""whereas"" (page 1) (and Sections 3.4 and 5.1.6) the contract states that either the generating company or the generating company's customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service.  In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed.  Specifically, a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific.  For example, the generator may sell the power to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service. The eighth ""Whereas"" (page 1) (and Sections 2.18, 3.1, 31.7, E.4.1, E.4.2, E.8.2, E.8.3, E.8.4, E.8.6, E.8.7, E.11.10, E.11.11, and E.12.) state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System (RMS) Agreement.  I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the ""good utility"" practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement.  Enron has signed the RMS Agreement.  I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard.  This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and, in order for RTO West to form, BPA must agree to join.  Enron is very interested in RTO West forming. If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard, we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard. Section 1.1  Contrary to our requests, this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective.   This is not the way the OATT operates.  Rather, if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement, Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC (as we have done) and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierra's open access tariff.  Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies.  The FERC has determined that filings under Section 212 (and therefor 211) of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT.  Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely  undermine the purpose of Order No. 888. Section 1.2 After, ""by both parties"" add ""however, if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement, System Owner shall file this agreement

Here's the answer to your question about paragraphs 42 and 44 of Duke's complaint.  Although CDWR is technically the SC for the UDCs in the short term bilateral market and the ISO, as a practical matter, if CDWR does not like the prices offered in the bilateral market, it waits to buy the power from the ISO.

Attached find two drafts, one a redline/strikeout and the other a clean first draft of the RTO West tariff glossary.  In addition to making the changes we discussed to the Transmission Operating Agreement, I also took the liberty of adding a number of definitions that I cribbed from the FERC pro forma (changing ""Transmisison Provider"" to ""RTO West"" where applicable).  I recognize that some of these definitions may not be applicable to the new types of transmisison service but I thought if we made these definitions available to the technical groups they could tell us if they needed them and we would be assured that terms were used consistently with the FERC pro forma

Again, the PX failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there. Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of it's availability.  If Market Participants don't know about this invoice being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments.  (That may be what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral.

Chris and Dave are coordinating. 
We should probably make sure we're coordinated on this one.  Greg Wolfe has a history on this one--apparently we've been contacted by Puget in the past, by certain of the customers in the past, and by consultants to the customers. Also, Dave Fuller was inquiring about Puget's customers as well. I know a bunch of the folks involved and may be able to help bridge some of the gaps--but my contacts are certainly not unique. As a final note, we need to be careful as Robert McCullough used to consult for Bellingham Cold Storage and GP--two of the companies involved in the mess.  Robert is not a friend of ours.

AReM Team: Here is report from Hertzberg news conference: Democratic Caucus announced a package of bills to increase the supply of electricity and cut down on demand through energy efficiency. The package being introduced will produce more than 750 megawatts and save 1,200 megawatts over the next few years. Said the energy efficiency package may save as many as 500 megawatts, equivalent to a new power plant. Demos presented a four bill package aimed at rapidly increasing and stabilizing the supply of power available to the demands of residents and businesses. The bills would: Provide $50 million to establish an incentive program to encourage business to install clean and modern on-site generation. Provide $150 million to develop clean and efficient renewable energy supply Allow plants up to 100 megawatts to be cityby local government andnot through Energy Commission review Ensure power by requiring new power plants to enter into purchasing agreements with the state.

Georgia Pacific and Bellingham Cold Storage are also large Puget customers. 
Chris Foster asked me for help with a Puget Sound Energy tariff that would allow us a quasi direct access to Puget's largest customers.  In response to his request I am sending him information about who the customers are, so he can contact them. 
Air Liquide et al v. PSE Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952 This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of a ""soft cap"" on prices PSE charges some large customers. On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint answer on the rate cap mechanism. On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary ""soft-price"" cap for power rates paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power costs if the utility was paying more than a maximum level. The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the level of the temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and the PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place pending further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48. Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific, Air Liquide America Corp. CNC Containers, Equilon Enterprises, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Tesoro Northwest, City of Anacortes, Intel Corp., King County's Metro Wastewater Treatment Division, Olympic Pipe-Bayview, Qwest and MCI WorldCo

I have only a couple of suggestions.  See red-line strike-out attached.  On the GenTie Agreement, are we not concerned about the results of third party review?  If we are, we should have the same third party review language (with my revision) as in the FS Agreement. Karen E Jones 02/06/2001 10:31 AM 
I'm following up on my email to you of 2/1 (attached below). David, it's my understanding from our call last week that we do not have a balance sheet or other accounting issue involved with these studies so long as we are not committing to any construction or other hard costs.  I've reviewed the agreements and confirmed that the only commitment being made by Antelope Valley Energy Facility, LLC, our project company  (""AVEF"") is to pay $50,000 as the cost of each study (which amount can't be increased unless AVEF agrees).  So it seems we are ok from an accounting standpoint - correct?  Please also confirm from an accounting standpoint that it is still acceptable, as we did with the initial Facilities Study Agreement with SCE for the project, that AVEF be the contract party with SCE. Mary, do you have any comments or concerns from a regulatory standpoint? The commercial team needs to sign both these agreements and submit them back to SCE this week, so please get back to me or Dean as soon as you can. Thanks, Karen 
Roger and David, I am hearing that there may be a hard cost/soft cost issue involved with interconnection system impact studies and/or tie-line studies, even though it seems that the work we would be paying for is engineering.  Please see the draft agreements that Dean forwarded to me (attached below) for the Antelope Valley development project, and let me know if we have such issues here. Mary, Can you please review the agreements and provide any comments back to me? What is the current thinking, from a regulatory standpoint, on whether we apply in the project company's name or in ENA or EPMI's name?  Roger and David, is your analysis of the above issue impacted by which entity is the party requesting the studies? Thanks, everyone, for your assistance. Karen

Although I don't yet have all the facts, Steve Hall said that late yesterday (Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX participants.  I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates the banking provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).  These provisions requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.  Second, these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent domain concerning retail service.  I don't have any law to support the second

Here's my solution.  FERC should tell the Cal ISO to file the stakeholder developed congestion management proposal arguing that it has been agreed to in the stakeholder process and that the ISO Board has no authority to do something else because they are not properly constituted.  We could also argue that the FERC should order the ISO executives to hire a consulting firm that will propose a slate of candidates and argue for a government similar to what has been proposed for RTO West.  This will help us in ultimately putting the West RTOs together.

I am under the impression that we still need to file the attached protest to a 12/13/00 Cal PX FERC filing that would (in the PX's interpretation) allow them to confiscate our collateral in the Block Forward Market to satisfy the defaults of other participants in the PX markets.  Please let me know if we don't need to file this.  Please give me your comments on the draft ASAP. 
Correct.  I wanted to terminate CTS for EPMI too but others decided this issue.  Sorry if there was any confusion.  Please make a filing for Portland General, consistent with their letter to the PX.  I am still waiting to hear from Enron Wind. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Do you want to get this or are you already an in-house compendium? 
We filed with FERC today a final version of this (which I don't yet have). We need to discuss Enron Wind doing the same.  Also, you'd need to send a letter to the PX terminating your particiaption agreement.  I'll send you the letter we sent.  I'm assuming you would want to get out of the CTS market as well as the Day-ahead and Day-of.  Call me ASAP 503-464-8862.  Thanks. 
Joshua: I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC so believe the attached Q&A meet your request.  If you need additional materials, just let me know. In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing with the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California Independent System Operator: Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the ""air traffic controller"" for the interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory. 
Linda:  Mary Hain and Tim Beldon have been working with Oregon PUC Commissioner Ronnie Euchas on electricity information disclosure.    From yesterday's hearing, there was some consensus to include legislative language in the energy bill to address transparancy issues.  As you know, Senator Wyden and Steve Kean had a positive exchange on this issue during the hearing due to the questions we had drafted.  I can work on the bipartisanship issue and gain support for federal bill inclusion from Murkowski, but we need a state federal nexis on drafting the legislative language to assure it meets both the federal and state needs.  please advise.  many thanks. 
Cynthia, Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested in following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on legislation. Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on this. - Joshua 
Linda:  do you want Dan Watkiss to be involved with the drafting also? 
Joshua:    Your boss did a great job yesterday and I thought the exchange between Steve Kean and he was very effective.  We would love to work with you and would be happy to draft some legislative language for your consideration which would address the issue.  Plus, I can be helpful in gaining bipartisan support for the provision.  Have you discussed this with Valerie at all? Since Tim Beldon in our Oregon office has met with Ronnie Euchas on disclosure, I want to include him on the drafting.  Thus, it might take me a day or two longer to get something to you.  Hopefully, I can have something drafted by Monday and I'll call you to see if I can come up and meet with you to discuss the draft lanuage, strategy, next steps, etc.  Thanks.

Cynthia, Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested in following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on legislation. Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on this. - Joshua 
I'm looking into whether we have to make a filing for EES too. 
Dan, At some point in the incremental meltdown of the PX process, perhaps when we default on payment of the large chargeback bill we will receive today or tomorrow and the PX takes our remaining collateral, the question will suddenly be:  how does one make sure one is not the last man standing?  It would seem that if it is possible to ever become a  ""former""   participant in the PX and not a ""current"" one, (""current"" being  the word used in the tariff to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and CTS markets.  Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a possible extradited extraction from the PX.  Thanks.----cgy 
I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 60-day notice period. I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter. Steve 
Christian asked me to work with Dan Watkiss to prepare a FERC filing to terminate EPMI's participation in the PX.  I have asked Dan to get started as Christian said we may decide to file as soon as today.  See attached explanation.  Does EES also have a participation agreement?  And if so do we also need to file a termination for EES?

At your request, here's a write-up of our problems with the ISO. Issue 1 - Concerning the intertie going North out of California into the Northwest (NW) at the California Oregon Border (COB), since about the 24th of January, the ISO has started telling market participants that the available transmission capacity, which is usually 2300 MW, is zero.  Last Friday, this caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about $50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day. This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.  I also wonder what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take similar action.  This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if

The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving PG&E's recent reorganization.

The available transmision capacity (ATC) ""derate"" did occur and has occured everydaysince about the 24th.  This fact was verified to me by our ISO customer contact on Friday.  Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this information is verifiable with the ISO.  Our customer contact didn't know exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged.  The reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency.  The line was again rated at zero today.  I have been pursuing the following approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved.  I've talked to Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston.  Eric believes he can get the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade press.  So check the trade press tomorrow. Paul Kaufman 01/30/2001 02:41 PM 
I agree with Craig ... we need to be really, really careful about the earth orbit issues identified below.   We shouldn't talk about the derating issue unless we can:   (1) confirm the derating occurred and document it; (2) tie the derating directly to action by the new board (i.e., determine that it wasn't due to maintenance or some other physical occurence); (3) show a direct impact on PNW prices that can't be easily explained in another way; and (4) show a continuing pattern (in contrast to an isolated event).

From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO gets cheaper power over customers in the NW. I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more difficult for him to balance his budget. The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't think we want to encourage that. What do you think?  Call me. 
Craig, - In addition, it is our understanding that the ISO has not cut transmission capacity to Southern California, although that action would have the same effect as cutting transmission to the north. Jim - I have forwarded this information to Paul & Alan so they can pursue this issue with the Governors.  Could we also give this information to Clearing Up, if they promised not to quote us?  Do you think that would be helpful?

We are trying to get long term transmission service from Sierra Pacific for LV Cogen.  Sierra Pacific claims that numerous parties are ahead of us in the queue.  We disagree (for some fairly complex technical reasons that I won't detail here).  Sierra Pacific won't offer us transmission service until it resolves the requests that are ahead of us in the queue.  At this time, we are planning to keep the project and may have difficulty getting financing if we can't get the transmission service.  It is my understanding that we have exhausted all negotiating opportunities with Sierra to resolve this issue.  I would like to have Bracewell and Patterson draft a FERC filing to resolve this issue.  However, I have been told that EPMI cannot make such a filing due to the pending merger.

Here is my idea for challenging the new ISO Board.  According to the trade press, one of the ISO Board's first actions will be to file with FERC to request more time to act on the FERC's requirement to file a market redesign.  We (or WPTF) would file a protest asking the FERC to reject the 
It was derated by 3200 MW, raising Mid-Columbia prices by $50-75/MWh.  It's not effecting Cal ISO's return of power because that power is flowing on different transmission, from the Nevada Oregon Border north, not from the California Oregon border North.

However, I drafted this letter at Alan's suggestion for purposes of discussion.  We should decide whether to send a letter before distributing this draft more widely in-house to discuss how to parse the

I thought we did not like the government of Desert Star (because it's ruled by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects of it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.  Why not wait until we get RTO West formed and then argue that the rest should be consolidated into it?  If we try to argue that California should join Desert Star it would be sort of like the tail wagging the dog and I would be concerned that California would try to take over.  Besides with RTO West, we have an organization that at least one Federal Power Marketer has said they could join. Alan Comnes 01/24/2001 07:40 AM

Sue, I am amending my previous statement about the 2-year delay in creating a multi-state RTO.  If FERC were to decertify the CAISO and order the CA utilities to join a regional RTO, I believe that DSTAR, the California IOUs and the CAISO infrastructure/staff/systems could easily merge and be up and running as a large Desert Southwest + California RTO before the end of the year.  This was basically what I had been trying to achieve last summer when I was facilitating talks between CAISO and DSTAR parties about merging the two. Why not lobby for that as the FERC-preferred solution to the state's illegal takeover of CAISO governance?

Hi!  Hope all is well. FYI - -- 
ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TO REMOVE STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS OF ISO BOARD Seeks To Allow Replacement By Consumer-Oriented Members January 23, 2001 01-006 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today filed suit to have the 26 stakeholder members of the California Independent System Operator Corporation vacate their office, seeking to pave the way for a newly reconstituted board representing the interests of consumers. The ""quo warranto"" action was filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. The lawsuit asks the court to have the 26 sitting ISO members ousted from their positions. The Attorney General has offered current members an opportunity to resign and avoid further litigation. The legal move seeks to speed implementation of the new law, AB 5X, which reconstitutes the ISO into a board of five members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Electricity Oversight Board. Governor Davis has appointed the five new members of the ISO governing board pursuant to the new law. The ISO board is responsible for operating, controlling and managing the power transmission lines that deliver electricity throughout California and between neighboring states. 
This is not public information yet but, assuming Tim gives his final okay, a guy will be joining the trading floor to develop a renewable market including a portfolio, trading, an index, auction, an Enron Online product, etc.  He wants to formulate a well developed regulatory policy approach and has agreed to draft up some bullet points for our use and has had preliminary meetings with various groups in Houston including Jeff Keeler.  He also wants to enlist the assistance of government affairs.  I suggested he do a presentation at our next government affairs meeting.  Are we still having people do presentations at our meetings?  Could we fit him in? Ginger Dernehl@ENRON 01/25/2001 10:50 AM

As if we needed another reason to avoid at all costs a default at the PX: I notice that one ""Event of Default"" under Enron's EEI master agreement is an Enron Corp default on indebtedness to third parties, which results in the acceleration of obligations in excess of $100 million.  This sounds like our doomsday scenario at the PX, under which we default on a payment or chargeback, and the PX liquidates our block forward/CTS positions, which the PX values in excess of negative $100 million, and then exercises our LCs. This makes it even more imperative that we (1) avoid a default at the PX and (2) reduce our CTS collateral with the PX. 
The public power person who wrote the article Sean is discussing has always been opposed to RTO West and was just seizing another opportunity to oppose it.  The FERC staff is no less commited to RTOs, and I'm sure the IOUs are no less committed for that reason.  In addition, I doubt FERC Commissioners in the new administration will back-track on RTO formation especially because of what has happened in California (how the state took too much control of ISO formation and control). 
FYI.  Lysa can we talk about this?

Nice final flame! Hoecker's Last Word:Calif Must Adopt 'Realistic' Pwr Plan 01/19/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- California officials have shown ""bald disregard"" for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing short-sighted policies that will push the state's two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy, FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday. The remarks by Hoecker, who resigned as chairman effective Thursday, came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California. Hoecker lambasted Gov. Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the state's power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts. State officials ignored the commission's Dec. 15 market-restructuring order and instead embraced ""conspiracy theories, resistance to more realistic rates, and calls for palliative price caps...to obscure the issues and delay solutions,"" Hoecker said. White House-brokered negotiations to develop power-supply contracts as part of a near-term solution are at an impasse due to ""unrealistic"" demands by Gov. Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production, Hoecker said. He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at below-present-cost, pre-1996 levels. Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies, Edison International's Southern California Edison Co. (EIX) and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PCG), will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the state's flawed market-restructuring law, Hoecker said. ""Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted. If it cannot, perhaps it will force debtors, creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light, without recrimination and posturing,"" he said. ""Let's be realistic,"" Hoecker said. ""Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait: Without a reasonable, technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises, they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support 
NPC still has not sent this. GRACE RODRIGUEZ 01/19/2001 08:50 AM 
Has this already been taken care of? I didn't get an e-mail or hard copy, so I thought I would follow-up. Let me know! Thanks, Grace Jody Blackburn 01/17/2001 02:37 PM 
Mary, I understand you received a copy of the NPC interconnect facilities agreement for Priscilla.  Would you please e-mail a copy to Don, Dale, Stan and I.  If you only have a hard copy, please see Grace and she can make a copy for all of us. Thank you. 
See attached E-mail from Paul.  As Paul discusses a bunch of us in the West have not done internal resource reports since about September.  Anyway, in response to Paul's E-mail, I have done a report.  Does our group do these reports?  If so who puts together the report for our group? 
As you will see by the attached Excel spreadsheet, this important report has not been updated by our group since September. It is imperative that you update the tab with your name on it and forward the information to Lysa. She will then update the master sheet and forward it to Houston.

As we discussed, here are some recent papers we have filed with FERC that will help you learn our positions and arguments on various issues, including 
Christi said that Dan should work on this because he knows the history.  Jim approved it. Can you give me a budget amount?  Thanks. 
CalISO filed a tariff to charge scheduling coordinators FERC's annual charge.  The ISO should charge end users (transmission customers).  As you know we just got FERC to rule that marketers don't have to pay the annual charges.  Tim wants to protest.  Protests due 1/19!  Please respond ASAP.

This E-mail is about a couple of issues I thought we might start coordinating on. As I mentioned to you this morning Paul, I thought you should be aware that Craig Gannett is planning to attend the NW governor's roundtable (that you will be attending) to monitor it for Cynthia.  I just found this out yesterday.  I will not be attending. In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on recommending changes to help solve the energy crisis for the NW.  Craig has been working on this with Cynthia Sanderr and I believe has circulated this paper in draft form to some degree on the Hill.  I have not given Craig any comments on the paper as yet. 
This looks fine. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Attached find the Cal ISO's Order No. 2000 filing.  It basically proposes nothing 
I will also be in the TOA and maybe the Tariff review group.  Thanks. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
The ISO has sent us the attached letter saying that we are required to file with it (and the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB)) our reports of prices over the soft cap.  It cites to it's Amendment 33 filing as authority.  The ISO's proposed tariff did not include any such requirement, rather it asked the Commission to so order.  Although the FERC approved Amendment 33, the FERC's order on the filing makes no mention of such requirement.  I would like Dan or Ron to advise whether this allows us to avoid filing this information with the ISO and EOB. I will also be asking members of EPSA what they plan to do during the conference call tomorrow. 
The ISO appears to have taken it upon itself to get above $250/MWh costs for the month of December pursuant to the Dec 8, 2000 emergency order. Mary, Steve and I need to confirm that these data are in fact required to be reported by that Order.  (Mary, can you point me to our copy of that emergency order?) Chris,  can you run a report for December 8-31 to see what accepted bids may be reportable?  During the breakpoint was $250, not $150. Alan C.

Thank you for the maple syrup.  Also, thank you for all of your great help last year. 
Is EES asking for too much here (especially extending the rate freeze)? =20 Wouldn't it be better to get this thing resolved (assuming that's possible)= ?

I'd like to expand on the last point.  The Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should report that information subject to confidentiality.  Also, if contrary to our wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault.

I am back in the office.  I assume you are handling this and will let me see a copy of the draft.  Thanks. Steve Walton 01/05/2001 09:34 AM 
I have not gone over the filing in great detail, I have found one thing we may want to file to address.  All the parties except PGE/Sierra/Nevada agreed to eliminate the export fees.  PGE/Sierra/Nevada made a joint filing asking the FERC to require the RTO West to include export fees and their effect in the financial modeling of their Stage 2 filing.  I think we should consider filing comments  to oppose this requiest from PGE/Sierra/Nevada for the following reasons: Elimination of the export fees is a positive step to resolve one of the three major ""seams"" issues.  With RTO West taking the lead, the other RTOs (CAISO & DSTAR) can follow suit. The nature and type of export fee to be used would have to be developed. This eat up an enormous amount of time on a speculative fee which the majority of the parties are opposed to including.  The delay engendered and use of limited resources is unconsiounable. We can reiterate our concerns regarding allocation of rights instead of an auction and about the potential exclusion of facilities from the RTO West control.  The December 1st filing really doesn't change those things.  Since the comments are due on the 16th and I will be gone all next week, I thought I had better let you know my views before leaving. I am including the IPP/Marketers comments for reference. Steve 
According to the guys on the desk, EPMI has 5-10 end user customers in Montana (for example Smurfit, Stone and others). 
FYI.  We have to make this filing and EPMI East has no retail customers. Thresa said the west does not either.  We will make the filing from here. Thanks. 
Christi, to my knowledge EPMI has no sales to retail customer nor are we participating and any retail programs at this time. Thanks Thresa Allen x36598

At the FERC Commission meeting this morning, Chairman Hoecker announced his resignation from the Commission effective January 18. Other Items at the Meeting: Hoecker summarized the meetings that occurred last night with Cal. Gov. Davis, Energy Sec. Richardson, Clinton Administration officials and industry representatives.  He said that the parties had produced a statement of principles on resolving the Calif. issues.  Specifically, he mentioned that the principles include a discussion of the regional nature of the market. Order on GridFlorida.   When GridFlorida made its RTO filing, they asked the Commission for an expedited order providing guidance on certain independence and governance matters.  This order provides guidance on: The process for selecting the RTO board The process for selecting a CEO and directors Rules for financial holdings by RTO board members. Items Struck form Agenda:  The Commission did not act on Illinois Power's requests to leave the Midwest ISO or the Alliance second RTO  filing. Commissioner Massey criticized the Commission for being slow to act on these items.  He said that at the heart of both of these filings is the issue of scope/configuration of RTOs.   He shared his belief that the Midwest must be treated on a regional basis. El Paso v. CPUC complaint.  This proceeding involves CPUC's complaint that affiliate El Paso Merchant is improperly hoarding El Paso Natural Gas capacity to California.   The Commission did not discuss the draft order. However, Hebert noted that he had dissented from the order. 
Based on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market transactions with the FERC and should not question the ISO about their reporting out-of-market transactions for the following reasons: Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was not artfully written.  Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information necessary for refunds. We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more liquid.  As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals will not be achieved. Nor will the Commission's goal of moving volumes out of the spot market be achieved if parties can simply withhold from the spot market and sell
