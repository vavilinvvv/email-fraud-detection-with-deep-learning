Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget. Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks. Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes. Regards

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite. As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas. This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning. ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare. Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly. Regards

As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on this Friday. Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire meeting and to be on time. Regards 
Guys, what is the contingency plan to manage these outages in the event we can't manage this as effectively in future situations? Regards Delainey

We are planning an ENA offsite on May 3rd and 4th at Columbia Lakes Resort (West Columbia Texas).  You were all contacted to save these dates on your calendars.  Both Cliff and I think this is an important opportunity for the business units to get together to discuss strategies and opportunities. We encourage you to attend for both days. The goals of the offsite include: a) to discuss strategies and commercial opportunities necessary to meet our financial targets for 2000; b) to discuss resource requirements and organizational issues; and c) to provide an open forum to facilitate discussion and team building amongst the businesses. Each business unit will have one hour to present its strategies and opportunities.  Specifically, we are asking the origination groups to describe their current strategy, detail the top 5 commercial deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that group.  Please submit your presentations to Kay Chapman no later than April 28, 2000.  The agenda is quite agressive but we wanted to give everyone an opportunity to discuss their business. A more detailed agenda and locations/times will follow shortly. Regards Delainey 
I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people. Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following: a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance. Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th. Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof. Please communicate to your organization as appropriate. Regards

Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance. Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th. Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof. Please communicate to your organization as appropriate. Regards 
We are planning an ENA offsite on May 3rd and 4th at Columbia Lakes Resort (West Columbia Texas).  You were all contacted to save these dates on your calendars.  Both Cliff and I think this is an important opportunity for the business units to get together to discuss strategies and opportunities. We encourage you to attend for both days. The goals of the offsite include: a) to discuss strategies and commercial opportunities necessary to meet our financial targets for 2000; b) to discuss resource requirements and organizational issues; and c) to provide an open forum to facilitate discussion and team building amongst the businesses. Each business unit will have one hour to present its strategies and opportunities.  Specifically, we are asking the origination groups to describe their current strategy, detail the top 5 commercial deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that group.  Please submit your presentations to Kay Chapman no later than April 28, 2000.  The agenda is quite agressive but we wanted to give everyone an opportunity to discuss their business. A more detailed agenda and locations/times will follow shortly. Regards Delainey 
Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could have this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time. Thanks for all the hard work. Regards 
Dan, in response to the following memo, can you discuss with Rick his ideas.  I would also like to go through a detailed description of each EES office, its people and functions to determine which should be eliminated and which should be modified.  Given the latest redeployments and terminations the field offices are a shadow of their previous stature either way.  This is consistent with our overall strategies but perhaps we want to accelerate.  If you could help set up the framework to discuss I would much appreciate. Good job on handling the ""5's"". Regards Delainey 
Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES. Couple of opps: - get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health; - followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise. Issues: - obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit. I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss. Rick Buy, what is our current credit position? Greg/John, do you have a view on this one? Rick Causey, we  probably need a more ""permanent solution"" ot the NewPower issue. Regards 
If we have the flexibility to afford a potential significant acceleration of NewPower losses/liquidity issues ie) going to zero and we feel we have our trade credit adequately secured then the right call is probably to abandon the seats.   Mark what is your view? Regards Delainey 
Jeff, I would recommend forwarding these to myself, Lavorato, Dietrich, Kitchen and Whalley in the future. Regards Delainey

Paul, thanks for the note.  Please clarify the following for me:  break out 2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al. Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams 2001 plans. Regards 
Wes, Dave Duran agreed to reduce his plan to flat year on year for commercial expenses - can you reflect that in your sheets please. Regards 
Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount. Regards Delainey 
Dave, You asked about office costs, depreciation and headcount: Office Costs are correct and include rent, supplies, backoffice expenses, general marketing and charitable contributions. Depreciation includes leashold improvements (walls, carpet and paint) and certain computers/IT not covered in the IT allocation (Tim is checking on the $278K) Headcount is close: my actual 2000 headcount is 38, not 36 and Tim's plan for 2001 may be overstated by one or two; overall headcount increase is probably 15, not 18. Hope this clarifies the plan. Regards, Chris 
Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 2001 IT budget.

I called Ronnie Lee to invite him to the New York Christmas party (he'll probably come) and we had a lengthy conversation about what they're doing right now. It sounds like they are down to 4 counterparties on their previous ""asset management"" solicitation:  Enron, Southern, Duke and Williams.  Williams is their first choice at the moment purely driven on price. It sounds like Williams is willing to effectively provide natural gas at a  below-market fixed price. Both Williams and Duke were comparable on price. Enron and Southern are close on price and just behind the Duke/Williams pricing. Although Ronnie claims everyone is ""right there together"", the small pricing difference is significant when looked at over 15 years. Williams will be with Ronnie soon (next couple weeks) to begin discussing contract language. He says documents aren't signed and I can tell he really wanted us to be at the table. We priced our last deal to him about 4 weeks ago and I believe the gas curve was higher than it is currently. Ronnie agrees that it would be worthwhile to reprice our deal since the prices were so close before. He said Jackson has  now joined Walton, Colquitt, and Satilla and they would like to come to terms on a definitive document in the December/January timeframe. I talked with him about Oglethorpe and Tom Smith, and he was very interested to find out we'd been meeting with them. He thinks Oglethorpe will only keep about 40% of the existing Oglethorpe load. He'd like to sit down and talk thru all this after we re-price our deal and I told him that Ozzie would be in touch to try and set up a time. Although I hadn't really planned to call Ronnie on this, I thought it probably wouldn't be bad to stir things up a bit!

Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal? Regards 
David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related cost allocations to ENA for 2001.  We have been given allocation projections that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.  I would like to know how this was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions. If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you please pass this on to the right spot. Regards

Soaring natgas prices revive interest in coal December 07, 2000 3:31:00 PM ET By Andrew Kelly HOUSTON, Dec 07 (Reuters) - Soaring prices for natural gas and concerns about future supplies are prompting U.S. electricity generators to take another look at coal which had fallen out of favor as gas dominated the nation's plans for new power plants. Wisconsin Electric started the ball rolling in September with plans to build two new 600 megawatt coal-fired power plants, the first to be announced in the United States in several years. Richard Grigg, president of the Wisconsin Energy Corp.(WEC) unit, said the decision was a simple matter of prudence and a way to avoid putting all of your eggs in one basket. ""We believe that a strong diversity in your fuel mix is a very important part of having a reliable and low cost electricity supply,"" Grigg told Reuters in an interview. Although coal accounts for just over half of U.S. electricity production, the economic and environmental advantages of modern gas turbines had made the decision about how to fuel new power plants something of a no-brainer in recent years. Consequently, over 90 percent of new plants currently planned in the United States are slated to burn natural gas. But as natural gas prices soar, hitting all-time highs of over $9 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, Grigg suspects that other power producers will also take another look at coal. ""Given increasing gas prices and concern for supply availability, I think you're going to see more people look for ways to utilize coal,"" Grigg said. BACK IN THE PICTURE Griff Jones, vice-president of power trading at Dynegy Inc. (DYN), said high natural gas prices and recent advances in clean combustion technology had put coal back in the picture. ""A year or two ago people wouldn't bring up the subject of developing a coal plant. Today there's talk about it,"" he said. For Dynegy, which began as a natural gas marketer and has made the convergence of the natural gas and electric power businesses an article of faith, that is quite an admission. Since the oil price explosions of the 1970s, the share of oil used in U.S. power generation has dwindled to around 3 percent. Nuclear plants deliver about 20 percent of the nation's electricity but construction of new nuclear plants is widely viewed as politically impossible following the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 1986. Natural gas currently supplies about 15 percent of U.S. electricity but is projected to gain market share steadily due to power generators' enthusiasm for the high efficiency and low emissions of the latest ""combined-cycle"" gas turbines. Oil and gas industry executives often cite projected growth in U.S. demand for natural gas of 30 trillion cubic feet by 2010, much of it fueled by increased use of gas for power generation. Plans for new gas-fired power plants are based on the assumption that the industry will be able to step up to the plate and deliver ever-increasing amounts of gas. FLAT GAS PRODUCTION In recent years, however, U.S. natural gas production has remained stubbornly steady around 19 billion cubic feet, augmented by Canadian imports of around 3 billion cubic feet. The recent surge in gas prices has pushed the number of drilling rigs currently searching for gas in the United States to unprecedented levels of over 800 from just over 600 a year ago. But so far, at least, production remains more or less flat as gas producers fight the accelerating depletion of mature fields. Plans for a pipeline that would tap huge unexploited gas reserves in Alaska will alleviate the supply situation, but the gas would only start flowing in the second half of this decade. Coal, on the other hand, is abundant and readily available: the United States has reserves equivalent to well over 200 years of domestic consumption. Ray Niles, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, estimated in a recent report that the United States will need 300,000-400,000 megawatts of new electricity generating capacity over the next decade, or somewhere between 800 and 1,000 new plants. Natural gas producers would be hard pressed to supply enough fuel for even half of that new capacity, he calculated. ""Therefore, we think it likely that new coal-fired generating capacity will also be necessary to meet demand growth,"" Niles wrote. ""We see no alternative fuel capable of producing the necessary power, due to political and time 
Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001. Regards 
Role? 
Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope and function of Redmond's group. Thanks Delainey 
Role? Dave, Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications (if any) it might be worth discussing. Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron Americas org for which I might be qualified, I'd certainly be interested in any new opportunities that come about. Thanks! Mike 
Tim, lets not worry about margin at this point - we are trying to get a handle on headcount and direct expenses/capital charge first.  You will have your day in court to discuss margin soon. Regards Delainey 
Dan, any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the Florida market at this point. Regards Delainey 
Hey Dick, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I did want to reiterate out need for  the GE 7FA's  for our Florida projects. Although I understood from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the que position) by then. I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings. Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two projects. Thanks Dick. 
Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget. Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks. Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes. Regards

Guys, great job - the Canadian office is still the model. Regards Delainey 
Dave/John, we have been awarded the RFP to assume the role of contract manager for the Ontario NUG's (some 1700 MW's) for a 3 year term. A definitive agmt will  be executed by the end of November. This was a high-profile RFP and I think that it confirms our investment in positioning ourselves in Ontario. This was truly a team effort (east/west orig, east trading, legal, regulatory) in responding to the RFP with a ton of long days needed in a short time-frame. The response to RFP was structured to manage all risks and well thought out which ultimately led to our successful bid. I attach an executive summary that gives further details. If you have any questions, please call myself, Paul or Eric. Regards Milnthorp

Mark, fyi and between you and I.  Rob will always do the right thing - he is just a little more passionate than the average Enron guy.  Keep trying to build those bridges. Regards Delainey 
Dave, I appreciate your comments and I think you make some very valid points. thanks, milly David W Delainey 11/02/2000 12:22 PM 
Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control. Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well. In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same. Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this. Regards Delainey 
Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very demotivated lawyer on my hands. Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to ""stay in the loop"" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a dollar and time perspective. Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between Houston and the employee. I would appreciate your thoughts on this. Regards Milnthorp 
I stand corrected - we need to DASH everything over $500K. Regards Delainey 
Dave, As of today, the Transaction Approval Process requires that any embedded financing over $500,000 needs to be DASHed.  RAC, however, is close to finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings--both prepaids and tilted swaps--that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation.  For example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated approval document.  This abbreviated approval document would only be available for transactions meeting these criteria if:  (i) structured financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium. The abbreviated approval document is intended to expedite the approval of relatively straightforward embedded financings where a full DASH is impractical or inefficient.  It is presently contemplated that the abbreviated approval document could be approved with two signatures:  the Originator's and  a RAC signature (either Bill Bradford's or mine), with business unit management and EGF receiving weekly updates on transactions approved via this document, but I would welcome your thoughts on this.  In any event, I will provide you with the proposed abbreviated process by you for your review and concurrence before if it is implemented since the preponderance of these transactions are expected to be originated by ENA. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Regards, Dave David W Delainey 11/02/2000 09:25 AM 
Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that we are reaching these goals. Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues. Regards Delainey 
Jane, we would like to go the Adjustment of Status route. Regards 
Great job - we all appreciate your management of the situation.  The A&A program is our most important asset. Regards Delainey 
Janet and Bruce, On behalf of the Analyst and Associate Program, I want to take this opportunity to let you know what a wonderful job Michelle Parks did while recruiting at Cornell.  I don't know whether you are aware but we had an interviewer not show up.  He also had not called to cancel.  Michelle was in the lobby waiting to leave and became aware of the situation.  Although she had pressing business in Houston, she made arrangements to stay so that we did not have to cancel the schedule. Cornell is one of our core schools and it would have been quite embarrassing to cancel a full schedule. We truly appreciate Michelle selflessness and believe she more than exhibits Enron's vision and values.  She should be commended. Thanks Charlene Jackson 
Great job guys  - keep it coming! Regards Delainey 
We have completed the sale of our Brigham investment for $20.0 million (JEDI/ENA).  ENA's net share of the proceeds for $12.5 million.   The transaction has been closed and funded and at the book/raptor value. My metaphor for pulling together liquidation transactions of severely distressed assets like Brigham is trying to shield a pencil balanced on its point in the midst of a hurricane.  In the case of the Brigham deal the hurricane was a Force Five. Jempy Neyman, who led the transaction, and Brandi Morris, a senior specialist in Special Assets, did an outstanding job getting this tough deal done. The next ""balanced pencil"" is closing the Basic Energy (Sierra Well Service) sale by mid-November.  We're on track:  so far, the hurricane has not  blown the pencil away.

Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the Hyatt.  John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg for mid market and yourself for origination. I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room. Lets discuss. Regards 
John, this is a Skilling issue - Charlene and myself are going to talk to him about several changes in the next couple of weeks. Regards 
Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the company we would be a $100 stock. On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight. I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better. The goals of any restructuring are: a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the program; b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained; c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling and interviewing; d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the ""Enron technology"" which include skills in market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk; e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues; f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, retention and performance tool; g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, non-traditional sources of talent and h) increase cost effectiveness. The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, people and teams, business tracks, etc. I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change. I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with a strawman. Let me know your thoughts. Regards Delainey

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers ( others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know. Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program. On the ""yeses"", please let me know who you would like to follow up on and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone wants to call any of the ""no's"", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

In connection with our sale of shares/warrants in FirstWorld Communications to TPG Partners III, L.P. earlier this year, ENA engaged Bear, Stearns & Co. to assist ENA and Enron Communications as financial advisor and agent.  Kevin Garland sent me earlier this week (via Steve Horn) a copy of the corresponding engagement letter dated 01-Dec-99 and signed by Garland and Horn (and by Richard Lewis of Bear, Stearns).  It stipulates that Bear, Stearns shall receive as fee 2% of the aggregate consideration received by ENA, or $2,582,351 (plus $25,000 in out of pocket expenses). Horn and Garland (and our accounting department) have confirmed to me that we have not previously paid any fee to Bear, Stearns for this transaction. Given the fact that the economics of the deal accrued to the account of ENA, it is probably only fair that we pay the fee.  I have instructed Stacy Hardy in accounting to wire the money prior to year end. Sorry to hit you with this so late in the year, but I only found out about it two days ago.  Call me if you have questions. MLM

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people. Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following: a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance. Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th. Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof. Please communicate to your organization as appropriate. Regards Mark and Dave

Dave, it looks like a lot of the people attending the Generation Strategy meeting are in conflict with PRC on the 6th. Please advise. thanks, 
Yeah, I think we are in PRC all day starting at 8:00AM. Rob Milnthorp 06/27/2000 12:43 PM 
Chris, does this not conflict with our PRC duties? 
Guys, we are set up for a meeting with the ENA Office of the Chairman to discuss ENA's generation strategy and iniatives for Thursday, July 6 th from 7:30AM to 11:00 AM.  The purpose of the meeting is to get buy -off on the strategy and start the approval process (DASH and Board/Skilling) specifically for Moore, LV Cogen and Pastoria. Proposed Agenda: a) Overview - overall map - current turbine book b) West:   Calger/Parquet -  Pastoria - DASH and approvals; - LV Cogen - DASH and approvals; - Coyote Springs - one page update - fyi; - PSCo - one page update - fyi; - other - few pages on future development strategy in west - fyi and approvals; c) Canada:  Milnthorp/LeDain - Project Moore - DASH and approvals; - other - few pages on future development strategy in Canada - fyi and approvals; d) East:   Dietrich/Jacoby - Austin Energy - one page update - fyi; - Florida project - overall proposal - many pages necessary to get approval - fyi and approvals; - LIPA - one page update - fyi; - Linden 6 - one page update - fyi; - other - few pages on future development strategy in east - fyi and approvals; e) Mexico   Yzaguirre - Monterrey project - couple page update - fyi; f) Genco   Miller - overview on ""Genco"" strategy - fyi. Regards Delainey 
Chris, I can assure you that I was not part of the ""organization"".  Got the books - going throough now and I will get back to you.  Keep Avista's feet to the fire.  speak with you soon. Regards Delainey 
Dave, Coyote:  BPAmoco flaked so Avista is trying to move forward to take the whole deal (some public embarrassment if they dont close since they announced it last week).  At the same time, DLJ is bringing in some of the industry players that originally expressed interest.  One of those parties that called Jake is Orion, so Jake let Don Miller know this.  We will have a handle on preliminary feedback from these parties on Friday. Pastoria and LVCogen:  Deal books should have arrived.  Do you want to meet on these?  who would you like to meet with?  Parquet for Pastoria and Gilbert/Clark for LVCogen? Pastoria DASH is being finalized along with the Catalytica DASH.  Pastoria costs will be higher given the unwind of the Xonon swap and the fact that turbine costs were padded by $9MM for GE's catalytica development costs (argument for a value-grab!) FYI I called Patrick Stevens of Triumph Energy three times...the number I called appeared to be an office shared with other companies.  The general number's voicemail was full so I have not reached him. Scott Healy changed his decision and is going to work for Duran.  I dont understand his decision but Scott said that the ""organization"" thought it would be a better opportunity in Houston. Chris 
Chris, Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the opportunity.  I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and expectations. I appreciate your openess and let me know how I can help. The Ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ENA over the next year. Regards Delainey 
Guys, as part of the new A&A program being rolled out by the ENE Office of the Chair, a new Associate and Analyst PRC is being set up.  I have nominated you as the six people from ENA to be on this PRC.  You will represent ENA's A&A's and participate in the evaluation and ranking across the entire company.  This is a very important function - please represent us well. Regards 
Rob, lets discuss. Regards Delainey 
Guys, can you help Phillip out with this, I assume this has something to do with the 20/20 deal.  I believe a reserve should have been set up for this payment which was only designed to ensure that the transaction was accretive to NBPL. Regards Delainey 
Steve, great letter and arguement, I think the more public we can be on this one the better. Thanks Dave 
Gregg, please send a hard copy - the pdf file can not be opened on ENA systems in Houston. Thanks 
Jeff, as per our discussion, this would be a great opportunity for you to spend some time with and instill your vision for Enron to the leaders of the ENA organization.  I have attached a preliminary agenda which has you speaking to the group right after dinner the night of December 14th.  You have no time constraint on the length of your talk (ie) whatever you find find appropriate in order to get your message across.  I though it might be interesting for you to give your vision of Enron's 2001 goals, objectives and strategy.  As well, a brief business overview of EES, EBS and Networks may be valuable in building connections. Regards 
Please plan on attending and presenting. Regards Delainey 
Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite. As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas. This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning. ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare. Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly. Regards Dave and John 
Chris, e-mail didn't pick up your name. You are invited as well. Regards Delainey

Fran, can you speak to Brian on this issue. Regards Delainey 
How do you want the Technical Analysis group handled for yearend PRC?  It is my understanding that they report directly to the OOC and as such, will not be included in any of the other business unit PRC's (i.e. EIM, East Orig, etc.).  Options are: 1. Have a tech analysis prc for the approx. 24 employees (portland and houston based) and the ratings are final  (however, who will give ratings for Mays and Virgo) 2. We ask one of the commercial teams to allow them to be discussed in their meeting (which will give cross  calibration and consensus). 3. Explore the possiblity of including them in a ""functional"" meeting with OEC or EECC? Please give me your thoughts! Fran 
David, thanks for the people listing. Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each market in as much detail as possible.   Looking for un-necessary overheads and where the income brightspots lie.  We would probably need the ESA 2001 budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.  A current balance sheet would be helpful as well. I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us. You need to get your Visa issues worked out quickly - Kay can help. Regards Delainey 
Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just play it by ear. At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following discussions/agenda: a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & historical prices and volumes; b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation strategy; c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product development; and d) brief review of other S. American markets. I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and any one else you think appropriate. Let me know what I need to do otherwise. Thanks Regards Delainey 
I would suggest day one in Sao Paulo and day two and three in Rio.  I would also suggest the Cesar Park in Rio, better location, although Copacabana Palace is more famous and classy hotel.  Trip from Rio to Sao Paulo is like from Houston to Dallas, inconsequential, spend the first night in Sao Paulo, hotel next to the office, and second night in Rio, travel to Rio on Friday morning.  Dave, call to discuss or I'll call you, including what would you like to do on Saturday, sightseeing, golf, surfing, work? 
I thought this Itinerary might be easier to read.  If you could send me the phone number to the Rio de Janeiro office, I would greatly appreciate it. Also, Dave wanted to know if you could arrange transportation for them.  He wants to be sure that we arrange transportation with someone you know. Thanks very much for your help and please feel free to call me with any questions (Kay 713-853-0643). Regards, Kay

D'Arcy, sorry I missed you last week. I am going to be down in Rio mid November for some meetings with the S American team. Maybe we can have a discussion then? I would very much like to get your opinion. Regards Delainey 
David, I am in Houston for meetings on Thursday afternoon and Friday, Oct 26-27. Do you have 30 minutes for me for some discussion on commercial opportunities in regards to electricity in Brazil, regional natural gas and crude oil and products - including some perspective on our present execution capability and competitive profile. David W Delainey@ECT 10/20/2000 11:12 AM 
David, can you point D'Arcy in the right direction in ENA or ESA. Regards Delainey 
I would like to introduce myself for consideration to working within your respective groups, but also including some commercial ideas relative to the South American region and elsewhere. I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not, and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston. I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need, including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron. Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf. 
Colleen, thanks for the update - as another part of the nat gas value chain, traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority.  However, I think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the FERC that will allow the market to work. Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately. Thanks. Regards Delainey 
Roger that - book 'em Dano. Regards Delainey 
Dave, I had a call from Bradford today and he has Buy's sign-off on recognizing U.S. $1.1MM credit exposure reduction as a result of our efforts on securing a 3rd charge on Beau's assets (additionally, the 3rd charge follows the assets with the Murphy credit upgrade). It is important to continue to send originators the right signals re credit mitigation and therefore I feel it is imperative that we grant the $1.1MM as origination to reward those efforts. Please advise that you are in agreement, and we will book asap. Regards Milnthorp 
Guys, attached you will find the updated orig plan for Q4.  Trading income is slim pickings so far ..... we need some key deals of all sizes to close in the fourth quarter from your organizations. Thanks Delainey 
Tim, that will be fine.  This is a discussion topic that I want your input on for next year. Regards Delainey 
Tim, don't worry about me - it worked out fine.  Just a bad day on the P/L side.  Thanks for leading some of these efforts it is often a thankless job. Regards 
sounds like a great idea 
Guys, I spoke with Mark this morning.  He is very supportive of the structure and idea.  I had indicated that he would continue to run the producer services business in the West but would also be part of the overall team as we plot out strategy in the West.  He wants to stay in Denver which I think we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into the overall team.  I had indicated that we would consolidate market making into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or not - if so he needs to move to Houston. Phillip/Barry, go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your plans going forward.  I will be speaking to Stephanie Miller this week and will give the green light with her shortly. Regards 
Jim, I would start focusing some attention on gas at this point.  When we get together I would like to sit down and go through a number of organizational re-alignments and what we may want to do on the regulatory front to support those businesses. Regards 
fyi Dave 
Dave, Short answer is ""no"". Long answer: Has had bad chemistry with some of the folks down there.  Maybe not all his fault...I do not have enough data. He wants to push Brazil as important Wholesale market (ie pulp & paper, ags, metals).  I think this is sound and worth looking at.  But I think this should be looked at by those groups.  They set their priorities.  If they want to pay for him being down there, we can house him and coordinate etc. But I am going back to basics with energy and can not afford someone pushing something for the good of Enron on my P/L.  Probably narrow minded, but hopefully pragmatic on my part. I used him last to interface with Networks.  He is pretty fast out of the chute (market analysis, who's who in country etc.), but then levels off before tangible bottom line contribution (during my observation period anyway.) Probably more of a ""think tank"" guy and the ""think tank"" ain't in Brazil. (especially post reorg) So is he worth keeping for Enron?  I say yes, in the right role.  (worked for Cargill previously with Risk Management experience)  Does he fit with Enron Americas in South America?  I say no and have told him as much. Call if you need more. Thanks, Kish David W Delainey@ECT 12/06/2000 07:01 PM 
Joe, do you have a home for this guy - he desperately wants to stay in S. America. Regards Delainey 
F.Y.I.  Mark 
Mark/Greg, Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week. I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like to discuss with you: Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in Brazil. Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), including e-business/Networks issues. Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South America and elsewhere 
Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week. I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal or external?) to complement.  I would start thinking about how to get that done.  I would call Oxley for help if needed. Regards Delainey 
Bench strength is limited....  I have no one ( so far ).  Phillip would like to keep Steve South in trading.  I am plotting a move from the central desk.... How did your conversations go with the Denver Office  ? 
Jim, lets get together in the next week or so to discuss progress.  In the meantime, what are we doing with regard to FERC 637 to ensure that we have favourable rules in the trading of natural gas transportation capacity?  Do we have a master summary of the RTO proposals submitted last week? Regards 
Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, assuming a fixed amount of the ""internal"" legal costs are fairly represented by this allocation as ENA's ""capacity"" charge, you are correct.  This number will be in the P/L under your name.  The ""outside"" legal costs should be tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I need an estimate of the quarterly ""capacity charge"" for ENA and an estimate of outside legal costs by business unit. Regards Delainey 
David, can you point D'Arcy in the right direction in ENA or ESA. Regards Delainey

Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible to get this out of either the trading or origination group.  As a significant contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room. Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely linked to specific legislation or policy.  This may not be the answer you want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds. Regards Delainey 
On September 29th I sent you an email regarding requests for personal political contributions to Tennessee lawmakers.  If you or any others intend to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible.   The election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final decisions on media spending.  Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying firm in Nashville. The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office materials, etc...).  Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a stringent campaign finance law. The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up to the business units with interests in Tennessee. If you need further information or would like to discuss this, you can reach me at 614-760-7472 or 614-306-4359 (cell). 
Barbara, we are getting tremendous pressure for contributions in these last days before the election.  As I have mentioned to you, Enron has been referred to specifically by one of the most powerful Senators.  Also, Lt. Gov. Wilder's campaign chairman called me in the latter part of last week, hoping for significant financial help for end-of-campaign TV buys.  Gif Thornton, Robert Gowan, and I are participating heavily; I cannot overemphasize the importance of Enron's participation.  The state ""money crunch"" which existed this past year likely will be worse when the General Assembly reconvenes (tax collections are coming in below estimates), and all existing tax exemptions will be at significant risk.  Please do what you can to get some Enron assistance for the candidates which we have discussed now. Thanks.  Bill William R. Bruce wbruce@stokesbartholomew.com Stokes Bartholomew Evans & Petree, P.A.

Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your capabilities better than ours. In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP controls in the nation. The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good lead into the health care segment. Regards 
Eric, as per my discussion with Rob, I believe that the site has the most value to us given its location and capability.  I would continue to actively develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies.  As far as the turbines, I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner. Regards 
Guys, what is your plan? Regards Delainey 
Dave, We will either: 1. Find an acceptable structure for the LIPA PPA (unit contingent - no replacement energy risk) and complete the transaction.   LIPA is aware of our issues and is considering how they want to proceed. 2. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to LIPA - probably the best case scenario. 3. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to ConEd, Morgan Stanley, AES or NRG (we are now in the process of agreeing CAs with these parties with respect to an infor memo on the barges/deal), or 4. Let BargeCo keep the barges (technically they still own them now). The time frame for resolving this is Q4. Regards, Brian David W Delainey 10/11/2000 09:30 AM 
Guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100M in nominal value): a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M b) 2 ABB 11N1 - Rob- $35M c) 1 501D5A - Janet/Chris - $25M d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20M All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects. Could you please provide me your plan with these units.  I would like to flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002. Regards Delainey 
Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board meetings and PRC's. Lets set up this discussion with the following points: a) we are not exiting Argentina; b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business opportunity; c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision making and greater communication; d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao Paulo. Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina - its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business model we are trying to move forward. Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and Orlando as part of this process. Regards 
From November 14-17, Houston will host Gastech 2000, one of the world's largest international natural gas, LNG, and LPG conferences.  The conference will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center and is expected to attract 3,000 delegates from around the world. Enron has played a leading role in this conference for many years, and this year we will participate as a sponsor and prominent exhibitor.  Several Enron executives are speaking or moderating panels at the conference, including David Haug, Bill Gathmann, Doug Arnell and Dr Lay. On Wednesday, November 15, Ken Lay will serve as a keynote speaker at an Enron Sponsored luncheon at 12:30 P.M. and we would like to invite you to sit at the Enron table.  The dining room is located at the George R. Brown Convention Center, Ballroom Level Three. Please RSVP via e-mail or call me at 5-6442, or Hal Means at 5-5384 if you have any questions.  Once we have the guest list finalized, we will provide you with details on the location of the entrance to the dining room, a pass, transportation/parking and other pertinent details. Best regards 
Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA point of view. The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project. The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M. the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, venture capital and the ""organizing group"" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality. Regards 
Rodney, from what you told me it sounds like GE is willing to play on the Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed.  Can you answer Marty's other questions? Regards Delainey 
Marty, no agenda on this one at all.  Given, the change in Enron Industrial Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.  Ultimately, the value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than ENA. Regards Delainey 
Brian, what is the cost basis in these turbines? Regards 
Jana, I had a late request from the Portland team to nominate a person, I don't think that Janet would mind letting them nominate this person.  If I am incorrect Janet let me know. Regards 
Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so. Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some value for Enron to take this deal including: a) $200 M in TCV for 2000; b) $3 to $5 M in value; c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers; and d) provides an ""in"" to the GE family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Dick, you are doing the right things - if you run into timing issues in the future do not hesitate to give me a call directly. Regards Delainey 
Dave, I agree with your perspective on this.  Building another theoretical model in the Basic situation seems naive to me.  This company is and has been in a financial death spiral.  For months, all involved on the ENA side have been focused on a probability that the Basic situation would result in a writeoff of a very significant piece of the Merlin debt and nothing for the equity.  The deal we are working on is at the high end of the projections reviewed with the rating agencies on recovery for the Merlin debt and actually gets us at least some chance of recovery on our equity. I do not agree that no effort has been made to market the company.  As you recall, we worked very intensively in trying to support an IPO which would take out the debt.  Despite many attempts to structure a successful offering (and a series of difficult concessions by Enron), the IB finally pulled it. The S-1, by the way, was about the ugliest I have ever seen. We carefully evaluated seeking an industry purchaser.  Our conclusion was that this risked losing significant value, would require a good deal of time, and had virtually no likelihood of equalling the recovery we have would achieve if we can do the deal on the table.   This evaluation was reinforced with the contacts we have had with industry players. In any liquidation there is always the possibility that another path could possibility capture more value.  In this case especially, I think we have a very good idea of reality and are making an uniformed decision to recommend a better-than-exected exit.  This is not a firesale. We will continue to work constructively with RAC in a non-confrontational mode on Basic.  Be assured, however, that if I feel there is a real risk of process getting in the way of achieving our objectives, I will raise a red flag.  Dick. David W Delainey@ECT 09/29/2000 11:34 AM 
Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient. It is too easy to state the obvious. Regards Delainey 
Janet, I'm not picking on you - I just can't believe legal and corporate let this go through. Sorry. By the way, Redmond will take responsibility for the Pan Nat arbitration as per our discussion. Regards Delainey 
Ouch! I'll leave it as is...no problem.

Dave would like to have a strategy meeting next Tuesday  Ocotober 10, 2000 from 2:30-4:30 in room 30C1. No preparation is necessary and it's important that each of you plan to attend. If you cannot attend, please contact Dave directly. Thanks! 
Chris, do you have a deal book -explaining the overall transaction, returns and risk? This will help me facilitate the process. Regards Delainey 
Dave, Wanted to give you a heads up... We are looking at a DASH for approximately $1.5MM for development of PSCO. This includes cancellation charges of approximately $350K and soft engineering/consulting costs through November 30 (expected receipt of air permit).  The plan would be to DASH with Board/Exec Committee approval the entire project in November.   Chip Schneider of RAC is OK with this approach given his understanding of the project risks and economics. The plan is to keep this off balance sheet through West LB -> Turbo Park with exit to a third party no later than Sep 30, 2001.  there is likely a need to bring in LJM to cover $2-3MM of hard costs (moving dirt) from Dec 1 through Jan 31. We are planning on executing the PPA with PSCO this week - it has sufficient conditions precedent to give ENA Legal (and me) comfort that we can walk if there is any problem with permits or site costs (land, water, transmission, fuel).  In addition, there is a Board out that ENA Legal drafted, negotiated and feels is a tangible out (unlike most Board outs).  We will have a definitive deal with NEPCO prior to execution of the PSCO PPA.  I spoke  with Jacoby and  Janet and told them we are planning to take the remaining two LM6000's for this project. I am available to talk about it at your convenience. Regards, Chris 
Chip, PSCO has modified their position and has accepted some of our negotiating points (heat rate, board out, permit conditions precedent) and will accept a 6-LM6000 project with a June 2001 start date.  The additional two LM6000's materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal. In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional equipment through West LB ASAP: 6 stacks  $1,188,000 3 Control Modules $375,000 1 CEMS  $675,000 4 230kv Breakers $340,000 Total:   $2,578,000 The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project. More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are minimal as follows: Now through November 1:    $257,800 Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000) Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at: 
Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.  I have difficulty with some of our VP's having signing authority.  I believe this is a significant control issue. Mark, is this widespread in ENA? Regards Delainey 
Well, I talked with legal about this and I understand that they can and do give signature authority to directors on a relatively frequent basis. I gave them the parameters for Ben to make it even easier. If they end up saying it's a bigger issue than originally articulated, I'll continue with Ben as we currently have it.  Thanks. 
Guys, attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot List for each business unit.  The performance of your group is key to making our targets for Q4 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the year.  Independent of specific budgets for the groups, the origination organization needs to generate $250M for Q4.  Ultimately, a strong performance in Q4 by the origination organization will help build momentum into the year-end PRC. I will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and specifics on the deals. Regards 
sure, just set up with kay thxs 
Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.  In order to reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups and managers have very low participation rates. I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% participation (ie) the ""unhappy"" folks are more likely to input info than the ""happy"" folks. Regards Delainey 
""The Pulse"" is the new name for the employee survey -- formerly known as Excellence Through Communication.  It is scheduled to rollout on Monday, October 16.  In an effort to boost participation, I would like to ask for your assistance in spreading the word to your direct reports at your staff meeting.  They should, in turn, encourage their direct reports to participate.  Last year, ENA's participation rate was approximately 50% and our goal for this year is 60%. The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete and can be done electronically.  The topics covered are: 1) What are the obstacles to performance and effectiveness? 2) What things hinder job satisfaction and fulfillment? 3) What more can be done to make Enron the best place to work? If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at ext. 3-9053. Thanks. 
Jeff, hopefully we can convince you to come when we re-schedule - seemed like an easy call. Regards Delainey 
Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work. Regards 
Janet, he can approve but can't sign as a director. You need to continue to manage. This would take a board resolution to change (ie) he can not bind the company as a director. Regards Delainey 
Kay, as we discussed previously: Effective immediately, I would like Ben Jacoby to have signature authority for his team's expense reports as well as all documents whose capital commitments are not greater than $250,000. Most documents will be confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and land/equipment option agreements. Please forward this (if need be) to the appropriate internal individuals who get this set up. Thanks Kay. 
Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on this one.  Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or collateral (reserve risk).  Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness. Regards 
Ike, is the president and CEO of TVA. FYI Regards Delainey 
Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective communication tool. I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are going. Please give me a call at your earliest convenience. Regards Dave Delainey

Guys, it will be very difficult to get money out of the power group - is the expectation that I come up with the dollars - just curious.  Are we not circumventing the spirit of the political contribution rules? Regards Delainey 
Gentelmen, Following is an email detailing requests for personal contributions to legislators who have been instrumental to Enron regarding our power plants in Tennessee.  I produced this list based on recommendations from our lobbying firm, Stokes Bartholomew, in Nashville. In 1999, Stokes Bartholomew, working with Jordan Mintz in Enron's tax department, convinced the state legislature to pass legislation clarifying that Enron's power plants would be exempt from the gross receipts tax.  Had we not succeeded in the effort, we would have had to pay gross receipts taxes of approximately $1.5 million per year. In 2000, Tennessee is one of the only states in the union that has been running a deficit in the general revenue fund.  Rather than going home for the summer, the legislature stayed in session and debated among themselves and with the Governor on how to solve the revenue shortfall issue. Eventually, they adopted unreasonably  optimistic revenue projections to produce a balanced budget (on paper).   This has not solved the problem because the state is already $100 million below revenue projections in the first quarter of the fiscal year.  The legislature will look for a long term solution when it returns in January.  Stokes Bartholomew informs me that all sources of revenue will be considered - this means our exemption from the gross receipts tax could possibly be repealed.  At this time, no one is singling this exemption out, but Stokes Bartholomew is cautious and is monitoring the issue closely. Numerous legislators supported the gross receipts legislation for Enron.  If our gross receipts tax exemption is threatened next legislative session, we would have to return to these same legislators (if they are reelected) for support.  As long as Enron pays taxes in Tennessee, it behooves us to take an active interest in supporting those legislators who will defend our interests in the capitol. Since you are the key contacts at Enron for Tennessee, I ask you to assess this matter and decide whether ongoing legislative support is important to Enron's interests in TN and make contributions accordingly. I have recommended $9,500 in contributions.  While this seems like a large amount, it is miniscule in comparison to the taxes we are not paying. Moreover, it will go a long way to helping us protect our interests against those who would fight to have ""big corporations"", particularly out-of-state corporations, get stuck with additional tax burdens to solve the state's fiscal woes. You are probably asking why we are not using Enron PAC funds or coroporate funds to make these donations.  Tennessee law prohibits us from using corporate funds and limits the use of PAC funds to those PACs that do not receive any source of support from the corporation.  Because Enron Corp. pays the expenses for the Enron PAC, we are not permitted to contribute Enron PAC funds to candidates in Tennessee.  This is one of the most onerous political contribution laws in the country. If you have any questions I can be reached for the next week at 614.306.4359.  Or you can leave a message for me at 614.760.7472. 
Per our phone conversation, following is a list of key legislative leaders deserving of Enron's support.  This list has been developed by our counsel/legislative agents in Nashville: Bill Bruce, Gif Thornton and Robert Gowan. Please feel free to call me to discuss further.  You can reach me on my cell phone this afternoon and all day tomorrow.  I will be in the office on Monday. Lieutenant Governor: Senator John Wilder (Democrat) $2,500 Represents Brownsville in the Senate. Sponsor of 1999 gross receipts tax exemption legislation for Brownsville. Has a serious opponent this November. The Senate elects the Lieutenant Governor who also serves as the head of the Senate.  It is in Enron's best interst that John Wilder win the election and be re-elected Lieutenant Governor. Rep. Jimmy Naifey $1,000 Speaker of the House Represents Brownsvile. Senate Candidate Larry Trail (Democrat) $2,000 John Wilder's personal mission, besides his own election, is to get Larry elected to the Senate (it is an open seat that is being vacated by a Democrat). If the Democrats lose this seat there is a very good chance that Senator Wilder will not be re-elected Lieutenant Governor because the Democrats will have lost the majority in the Senate. Rep. Matt Kisber (Democrat) $1,500 Represents the Jackson area. Very pro-business Democrat. Is in a very tough race because the district was redrawn and it now majority Republican. Matt is the chair of the House Finance, Ways and Means Committee - which hears all gross receipts tax matters. Was very helpful to Enron on the gross receipts legislation. Senator Jerry Cooper $1,000 Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee His committee hears all legislation relating to energy and power plants. Rep. Shelby Rinehart $500 Chair of Commerce Committe (all energy and power plant issues) and powerful member of the House Finance and Ways and Means Committee. He is extremely powerful.  Bill, Gif and Robert have a very good relationship and rely on him for assistance for their clients regularly. Unless otherwise noted, checks should be make payable to ""Friends of _______________"". Please forward to Bill Bruce fo personal delivery.  (or if you want to get them to me I can pass them along) Bill Bruce Stokes, Bartholomew, Evans and Petree P.A.

I am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.  I just think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with families.  The drive to Galveston and back - the overnight babysitter - the potential trouble that may result in close quarters and hours of drinking et al.  I prefer the original idea at Enron Field. Regards 
Congratulations to the entire deal team on the final execution of the AGL-VNG contracts! You guys did a great job at identifying the opportunity, managing and negotiating with the customer, managing the regulatory and legal concerns, and valuing and structuring the deal in a win-win manner! This was a very focused effort and managed and executed very well. Well done! 
Kevin, how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company? Regards Delainey 
Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas and power business.  Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and generate deal flow.  As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the market than focused on internal issues.  As far as specifics, you will have to wait and see. Thanks Delainey 
I enjoyed your presentation this morning.  You mentioned that one of your current tasks is ""pushing the legacy origination/structuring model to the next step"".  What do you mean by this?  Do you envision using the internet or other technology to enhance the current origination structure? 
Chris, you are officially the king today!  With the PSCo deal this effectively eliminates the LM position assuming we successfully sell LV. Regards Delainey 
Dave, The CA ISO Board met today and approved a plan to provide capacity subsidies to up to 2,000 MW of new supply.  There was 71 proposals from 24 companies. We offered 7 proposals.  Their decision criteria is ridiculous and subject to change, but it looks like we won the following: 1 LM6000 - 45MW - Pleasonton - $6.9MM per year for three years -  $153/kwyear 1 LM6000 - 45MW - LODI - $6.9MM per year for three years - $153/kwyear 4 FT4's - 96MW - Southern/Palo Alto - $13.2MM per year for three years - $137/kwyear Las Vegas Cogen / EPMI 225MW Palo Verde Sale $10MM per year for three years - $44/kwyear In the first three deals, we have the full rights to the energy; capacity payments are for availability.  These payments, combined with reasonable toll values, terminal value and EPC costs, make the projects economic (DASH forthcoming). The last deal is a bit strange and non-conforming but the ISO likes it because it is priced very low.  Basically, we agree to deliver power to the ISO at the California border next summer priced at PX Index plus $20/MWh.  CA ISO takes power, sells into PX and receives Index.  This is cheaper than what they are paying for new capacity in state.  The $20 premium is simply the basis between Palo and SP15.  In 2002 and 2003, LVCogen commits to sell 500 hours to CA ISO and receive PX for its energy.  In 02 and 03, the Palo/SP spread collapses so an asset buyer sees this $20MM as gravy. Lot of moving parts - I will keep you posted.  Parquet, Mcdonald and Laird are doing a great job. Chris 
Oz, David is interested in the fuel cell business, do you need his skill set? Regards Delainey 
Dear David, My name is David Ronkainen and I have been an Enron employee for about one year.  I joined Enron as a result of my interest in fuel cells as a business opportunity for me.  I met with Dave Ramm to discuss that opportunity and he asked me if I would be interested in working for Enron. I recently read a press release that ENA had entered into an alliance with Fuel Cell Energy, Inc.  I still have a strong interest in fuel cells and the belief that they will be the most commonly used power supply of the not so distant future.  I went to a seminar on distributed power in Washington D.C. last week to talk with the technologists and hear what the investment community thought about fuel cells and microturbines.  I learned a lot. Right now I am working for Enron Corp. Environmental, Health and Safety.  My job is interesting, but I have a stronger interest in fuel cells and the power technology that will serve DP.  Do you have a job opportunity for a technologist in your business that is involved with fuel cells and microturbines?  If there is an opportunity I would like to talk with you about it. I graduated from Michigan Technological University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.  I have worked in manufacturing and the oil field service business.  I have worked at the corporate level in both businesses. I know what it takes to efficiently manufacture a product and how a business should be run.  I also understand the opportunities and liabilities that environmental protection poses to new industries and technologies.  I  know that I can help Enron in this area. If you would like my resume please let me know. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, David Ronkainen 
Erin, don't want to keep passing the ball;however, this is a retail opportunity in almost all states (ie) railroad demand is classified as retail customers under most IOU tariffs.  I would ask Harold Buchanan Regards Delainey

The full idea has been submitted to eMeet. 
Charlene, the 2nd is ok. Either Mark, myself or John should probably be able to do the 28th as well.  Obviously, we strongly believe in the benefit of the program and its goals - ultimately, we  have to walk the talk! Regards Delainey 
Hi Dave, Thanks for agreeing to participate in Super Saturday.  Unfortunately, I gave you the wrong date.  I think I told you December 9th and it should have been December 2nd.  I hope that is still OK.  We are still looking for someone to do the first one which is October 28th.  I think it would be great if someone at your level could start it off to send a message.  However, I won't get greedy  I will take what I can get (smile). Just let me know. With respect to the straw man, I have worked on it but it is not complete. Celeste was scheduled to be here this week but has been put on bed rest by her doctor and has had to leave a week early.  I am trying to work with her recruiters who are in the middle of campus presentations, etc.  I will finish working on it this weekend and we can meet on Tuesday.  I will call Kay and get on your schedule.   I will try to get you a draft prior to our meeting (by Monday) so you can review it before hand. Thanks Charlene David W Delainey@ECT 10/04/2000 01:58 PM 
Charlene, that will be fine... on a different note, where are you on the straw man we spoke about.  Ultimately, I would like to continue to push this with the leadership team. Regards Delainey

Guys, please take a read of the draft memo - would like to send out tommorrow. Regards Delainey 
Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility? Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated structure in the RFP? Is this a play that you would support? On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons. How is it going otherwise? Regards Delainey 
Marion, the leads include Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan in the Eastern Origination Group and Michael L Miller in the Principal Investing Group. Regards Delainey 
David, Congratulations on the Fuel Cell venture.  I have been trying to get Enron interested in this technology for many years.  I am glad someone found the right formula.  I would like to discuss applications of Fuel Cell technology and where Enron intends to take this product with someone in your organization.  The press release did not disclose who the lead promoter in your organization is.  Can you direct me to the right person? Best regards, Marion Cole 
Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical feedstocks into industrial gases.  He wants to establish the technology in Baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital.  This is probably a stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him.  I am not advocating this play just passing on the message. Steve Paras 718-630-5611 He will be in Houston on Friday. Regards

Jim, this sounds like an ambush..... :) 
Guys, assuming that we receive $7M for the 6B's what is our cost basis in the Barges? Regards Delainey 
Dave: Status of the 6Bs:  Enron Nigeria has sent us $7.1MM for the two turbines. We have an agreed turbine purchase contract that we have executed and that Enron Nigeria are supposed to execute today.  Per our discussion, Wes C. suggested that we push the $2.0MM additional write down as well as the $7.1 turbine purchase revenue to Q4. Status of LIPA/Barges:   We are working in two directions.  Currently, we are: 1. Finding a buyer for either the LIPA PPA/Barges together, or just the barges by themselves 2. Discussing with LIPA, the Power Desk, and BargeCo to find an acceptable PPA structure and barge price to meet our risk/return criteria. The decision tree for the LIPA deal is as follows: IF: The LIPA PPA can be structured to be unit contingent for energy, AND: The power desk can get comfortable with the capacity availability risk (discussions ongoing) AND: The economics of the deal are acceptable given the price for replacement capacity charged by the desk. AND: All permitting issues are either resolved or resolvable OR, IF: We can find an ""as-is, where-is"" buyer for the Barges with/without the PPA (ConEd, Montauk, NRG) THEN: ENA will purchase the barges from BargeCo (Barges are currently located in Brooklyn) ELSE: We will not purchase the barges and will shut down the LIPA deal. 1. LIPA:  We will fall back on permitting issues and schedule to as a reason to stop working on the deal. 2. BargeCo:  The barges will have a lower performance than what was originally stated by BargeCo.  Additional capital investment would be required to meet our performance requirements - our position is that this additional cost must be borne by BargeCo.  We do not, however, want to implement this action until we have sold the 6B turbines to Enron Nigeria so that we are sure this transaction is completed. David W Delainey 09/29/2000 08:25 AM 
Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?  My understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) no more 6B's or barges. Regards Delainey 
Jim, I am not sure that this will attract the people we want to hear the message; however, I will hold back judgement until we discuss the strategy in more detail. Regards Delainey 
Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient. It is too easy to state the obvious. Regards Delainey 
David, you may be getting to the nub here.  Ultimately, this is a lot more art than science.  It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision rule to manage this process.  I am looking to the opinions of yourself, Ray, Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return assets (ROCE >25%). This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that comes from this group.  As a result, I need to have a positve consensus from this group in each case. Regards Delainey 
Dave, Your comments on the Basic DASH are well-taken.  We will clarify what RAC views as the current valuation of Basic as well as RAC's recommendation with respect to this divestiture and modify the DASH as quickly as possible. Your comments prompted a question with regard to ENA's divestiture strategy. Is it correct to assume that if we use a typical market liquidity premium of 30% (i.e., future divestiture proceeds are 70% of the expected terminal value at the divestiture date to account for potential changes in future market conditions) in a sale deferral scenario and this deferral results in a higher NPV at the RAC capital price than the proposed sale proceeds, ENA would elect to retain the asset?  Or should a higher than ""market"" capital price be assigned by RAC to these assets earmarked for divestiture? Regards, Dave 
Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?  My understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) no more 6B's or barges. Regards 
David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH. Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given the possible recovery of this sector? The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy prices. Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions? Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring. Regards 
Jeff, I think we should take a quick review of the existing PI portfolio to see where we are and where we want to go - we have with the completion of FCEL made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time >$60 to $80M.  I would like to  hear how we are moving to monetize more mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage investments.  I don't want to approve any further investments until we have had such a discussion. Regards 
Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I understand your position.  In the interest of facilitating continuing dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions, I will send you our document.  I would suggest that we try to set up a follow up meeting in early October once you have completed your work. Regards Dave Delainey 
Dave Thanks for your September 25 email.  TVA is currently developing the numbers we agreed to share in our meeting last week, but given the importance of this effort, TVA is going to need additional time.  Trying to complete the task by this afternoon did not prove feasible.  We can, however, have this information ready by October 13. I will give you a call to discuss a mutually satisfactory method for exchanging the information. Regards Ike Zeringue 
Guys, can you give me an update on what this deal is about - e-mail would be fine? Regards 
Guys, how are the business units doing on the ""talent pipeline"" since we have put this on auto-pilot?  Is HR still providing resumes? Regards 
Bruce, obviously ENA does not have a problem with this. Regards Delainey 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels - At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns. Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2. Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco. The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates. The following is a summary of these competition provisions: Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk management services. There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction. ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix). ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii). It does not include Japan and Australia. The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003. Thank you, 
Chris, this sounds good.  It would be helpful for us (the overall power business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.  I think we all believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and rewarded. Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow. I look forward to sitting down to discuss. Regards Delainey 
John, completely agree with your view - David, I would have the matrix, with all of the ENA statistics and names, ready for distribution on Friday to the key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks. Regards Delainey 
I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.  I think we need 100% of reviews done.  Do you agree. 
Guys, please take a read of the draft memo - would like to send out tommorrow. Regards 
John, I think you may want to be part of this. Regards Delainey 
Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I think it works welll in allocating resources between competing ""going concerns"" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly effectively. Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of time on this. Regards 
Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.  Further, I want to confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the short run value of the project.  In other works, we have no intention of lifting their offer.  Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines. These guys add no value and they are killing me! Regards Delainey 
Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA could create significant value from a project that we have very little invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant dollars or taking significant risks. Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy. Regards Delainey 
Dave: See attached memo. Thanks, Dick

Krista , you are very welcome - best of luck in the future. Regards 
Jim, I have forwarded your binder to David Oxley to set up a meeting for the wholesale group to discuss appropriate homes for your people.  It has taken a little longer than expected to get people together but we are making progress.  It may be helpful for you to identify, like Abe, where these folks would like to go if they had their druthers. It may be worthwhile for us to have a quick phone call to discuss. Regards 
Ok - you got the ball. Regards Delainey 
Joe, part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of cashflows that we would probably like to monetize.  Have you looked at this? Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are giving us 89% of our carry value in cash and 11% of our carry value in a contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership. Lets discuss ASAP. Regards Delainey 
good job - keep them coming! Regards 
Kay, can you set up a dinner with Randall. Thanks 
Dave, Thanks for following through with the contact.  As we discussed, the discussions we had with Calpine were at a local level and very preliminary, with Bridgeline indicating to Calpine that we are always open to looking at ways that will enhance shareholder value.  I agree with you that at this time it has a low probability of evolving into anything. On a separate note, I would like to take you up on your offer of your time and resources.  I know that Bridgeline is a very small component of the things that are on your radar screen, but if it is not too much of an imposition, I would like to have a one on one discussion with you concerning a few of the issues we discussed at the management committee mtg. I want to make sure that I am crystal clear on the perspectives and desires of both parents.  Coming from Texaco, I feel like I have a good feel for Texaco's short and long term expectations for the partnership, however I would like to dig a little deeper with you on a few of the issues we discussed at the management committee mtg, and a couple of your points in your follow up email to me. The afternoon or evening would work best for me, and I would be happy to pick up the tab for dinner one night if that fits with your schedule.  The balance of this week is kind of tight, however, the week of September 2nd and 9th are fairly open with the exception of Tuesday night the 3rd. Thanks for your help, look forward to talking to you soon. Randy David W Delainey@ECT 09/22/2000 06:48 PM 
Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real knowledge of the potential deal.  Likely this originates at the local level and is probably a long put.  Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more detail over the next week. Regards Delainey 
Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on Wednesday.  Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so that we can ensure that we are comparing ""apples to apples"".  I would also suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers. It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties settlement offer. I am in the office over the next several days. Lets discuss at your earliest convenience. Regards Dave Delainey 
Christi, I was unable to open the file can you please send a hard copy. Regards Delainey 
Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits: a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with GE and b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission correlating into increased operating hours. I need two things to determine if we want to move forward: a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal? I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you. Regards 
Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology. Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value or multiple value based on 90 degree output. I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer. The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing. My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and adjust tactics with EECC as necessary. Regards Delainey 
Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real knowledge of the potential deal.  Likely this originates at the local level and is probably a long put.  Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more detail over the next week. Regards 
Guys, as usual the investment is subject to RAC review and a DASH. Regards Delainey 
Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward under the structure we have discussed. FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 60MW of orders; - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that call; - the transaction is fully press released immediately. CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW; - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL. I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner. Thanks Delainey

This is a reminder !!!!!  There will Not be a Friday Meeting September 22nd, 2000. 
FYI 
Dave, I spoke with Frank Gardner, the acting President of the mine.  The mine has shut down due to high power prices and they are evaluating reopening it later this year.  John Malowney in our mid-market group has covered these guys very well (Frank acknowledged that).  EPMI has served this load in the past and made numerous proposals to them during the past year.  Montana rejected these, including the attached proposal that offered to fix prices well below the current forward market price.  John has also proposed various cross-commodity (copper) deals with our MG affiliate.  John will discuss their situation with Frank and I will follow up from time to time.  I do not think there is an attractive generation opportunity as Montana is net long and the industrials' credit is marginal.  We will keep you posted if anything materializes. Regards, Chris 
Chris, I called MRI but Frank was too busy to take the call so I left my name and number and said if nothing else I'd see him on the 5th of October.  Just so you'll know, attached is a sample Term Sheet that I have previously showed MRI.  Note the prices that were ""too high"" at the time.    John 
Randall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved. It was a pleasure to meet you and your team. The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include: a) improving the financial performance of the entity; b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in every manner.  In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis; c) continue to move from the ""heavy lifting"" approach to becoming the ""smartest pipe"" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors (ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL. We will be very supportive of innovative and aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline. My time and resources are at your disposal. Regards 
Jim, agree with you - why don't you set up some time for us to speak and go through the Regulatory report and iniatives. Regards Delainey 
Dave - FYI. While comprehensive electricity reform legislation looks very dead, there are those that are pushing ""stand-alone"" legislation before Congress.  Attached is a letter that Enron will sign on to that opposes stand-alone PUHCA reform.   This bill is being pushed by Mid-American. Government Affairs continues to oppose all stand-alone legislation. Basically our only real leverage is to keep PUHCA, PURPA, reliability, and wholesale access legislation linked in a comprehensive bill.  This may incent the holdouts to agree to our needs. If you need any additional information, please let me know. Thanks, Jim 
We should do it. Thanks. Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON 09/19/2000 03:29 PM 
Unless we hear concerns from you, we plan to lend Enron's name to the attached letter to the Congressional leadership opposing the MidAmerican attempt to pass modified, stand-alone PUHCA repeal.  Others signing-on so far include:  ELCON, TAPS, Calpine, City Utilities of Springfield, Consumers for Fair Competition, Missouri River Energy Services, and Northern California Power Agency.  The letter is to be sent Thursday, September 21st so please advise if you have concerns no later than close of business the day before. Thanks. - PUHCA letter3 9-00.doc 
David, on a go forwards basis, please ensure that there is a technical sign off on the principal investments DASH.  I would like either Bob Virgo or Wayne Mays to have a look at these investments from a technical due diligence point of view and to be on side before the investment is made. Regards 
Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following: It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons: a) provides an additional ""Friend of Enron"" to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group; b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business. ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group. Regards

Dave: Attached is a draft of the responsibility and timing for all the assets in the portfolio.  I was in meetings today and was not able to sit down with Dick but will do so on Tuesday to move the majority, all except Heartland, from '01 to '00. Expect a revised version no later than Wednesday. Jeff 
Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating. In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis. Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the East. Regards Delainey 
pls set up 
Dave: Do you think your and Lavo's schedules would permit your coming to one of my Staff Meetings.  We typically meet on Thursday's at 5pm, but could easily modify.  I have an ""eclectic"" Group of around 35 that would enjoy the opportunity to hear from you guys for a half hour or so with a couple of Q&As. Let me know.  Thanks. Jordan PS- Morris and I were in Calgary last week to discuss our Tax position and mitigation strategies, Slugger acquisition (I am not confident that we will see any benefits this year if we complete this deal.  As Rob may have told you, it is moving real slow), transfer pricing, etc.  I think things went really well and I would be happy to provide you with more detail, if needed. J 
ok if Mark is ok. Regards 
You caught us .... 
Hope you're enjoying the 40 ""lit"" pens- just wanted to let you know we've got your ENA  RC # to bill you for them...$2,000 ..... which just so happens to be the same amount that ENA billed me for the trip w/ you & Delainey back from Calgary  a few weeks ago...that's the trip during which  I hitched a ride  from you all ... amazing coincidence that the #'s are identical.... I'm wondering , though,whether I should be receiving a credit for the stamina required for a 4 1/2 hour trip w/ the two of  you??

This note is a reminder of our Strategic Reveiw meeting scheduled for 9:00am, Tuesday September 19th, Suite 4400 3 Allen Center.  We will follow the Strategic Review meeting with our regularly scheduled management committee meeting.  Lunch will be served.  See you then. 
FYI Lets discuss Regards Delainey 
Hello everyone! Joe Sutton would like to have a meeting to discuss the above subject on Monday, September 18 at 10:00 am - Houston time.  If you plan to be in Houston at this time, please meet in Jeff's office.  A telecon number will be arranged and we will furnish this number to you tomorrow. Due to Jeff's very busy September calendar - this is the only slot we could get. Thanks for your support! 
Mike, this appears to be a very reasonable settlement - proceed on this basis.  I assume this keeps my number in and around the $600 to $615MM for the 2000's all in. Regards Delainey 
Dick, I have done some more research on the cost versus Peaker Fee issue.  The numbers from ENA's side lay out as follows: ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs  $4,449,000 ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete $   720,000 Reduction in Variable Overheads  $3,000,000 IDC on ENA Overpayments   $   200,000 Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable  $   180,000 Westinghouse L.D.'s- Gleason   $1,800,000 Westinghouse L.D.'s- Wheatland  $   500,000 Preliminary Total Reduction in Project Costs                  $10,849,000 ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs:  ENA paid according to pre-determined cash curves every month.  NEPCO's actual costs appear to be coming in about $4.5 MM less per the audit results that we both reviewed last Friday. ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete:  When we met last Friday, there were $1,459,000 of Open P.O.'s and other items that NEPCO still needed to investigate and closeout, you have a copy of the detailed schedule prepared by Amy Spoede.  Of the $1,459,000, there was $720,000 showing as still owing to ABB for Circuit Breakers at Wilton Center.  ABB has informed ENA that they have been payed in full for quite some time, thus I believe that this $720,000 is an accounting phantom that NEPCO needs to clear up. Reduction in Variable Overheads:  The $3,000,000 in variable overhead reduction is the number that you offered to cut this cost in our meeting last Friday. IDC on ENA Overpayments:  As part of our agreement with EE&CC/NEPCO, ENA agreed to pay 2000 peaker construction costs based upon cash curves versus actual invoices.  The cash curves consistently overestimated NEPCO's actual disbursements, even after quarterly audits and true-ups.  NEPCO currently owes ENA over $200,000 in IDC at the cost of capital charged by Enron Corp. Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable:  Some EE&CC/NEPCO personnel coded time against variable overheads that should have been charged against the pre-agreed fixed overheads. Westinghouse L.D.'s:  ENA paid Westinghouse directly for the turbines.  ENA has held back $3.5 MM of retainage pending resolution of L.D.'s. EE&CC's/ENA's position is that Westinghouse owes $2.3 MM of L.D.'s ($1.8 MM @ Gleason, $0.5MM @ Wheatland).  The aforementioned L.D.'s are for delivery and schedule delays at Gleason and Wheatland.  There is an additional $1.0-1.6 MM of performance L.D.'s for missing heat rate guarantees at Gleason.  ENA will negotiate the performance L.D. settlement directly with Westinghouse because the cure will be getting additional MW's in trade against the L.D.'s. Otherwise, Westinghouse can cure by minor unit modifications and re-test versus paying cash L.D.'s.  However, the Delivery and Schedule L.D.'s will still be negotiated by EE&CC. Peaker Fee Settlement:  Based on our last meeting and additional research, I suggest the following path to quickly resolve the Peaker fee amount and payment.  If EE&CC will take over the risk/reward of the Delivery & Schedule L.D. issue with Westinghouse, then ENA will recharacterize the amounts detailed above as Peaker fee payment.  If EE&CC is successful in keeping all the Schedule L.D.'s from Westinghouse, then it would have a $10.85 MM fee versus $9.2 MM.  EE&CC only needs to keep $650,000 of the $2.3 MM of Westinghouse Schedule L.D.'s to have a $9.2 MM fee. Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here. Regards, Mike J Miller 
Kay, please find room 
Good note - don't think I could do better in style or timing! Regards Delainey 
Hey guys, just a few housekeeping notes: 1.)  Employee Expenses:  We really need to try and trim the expenses where and whenever possible. Get your Assistants to make all reservations for air/hotel/car so that they can ensure the best rates for your needs. ENA (and our groups) spends an incredible amount of money on travel expenses and we really need to attempt to trim this back where we can. Efficiencies in booking can probably help a lot. That means use Vitol or TAP or whoever else if they're cheaper and give you good service. Letting your Assistants handle your travel arrangements will not only ensure the best rates, it should allow you to spend more time on more productive endeavors! 2.)  Customer trips/expenses: Any customer expense greater than $2000 must be approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman in advance of the expenditure. Your Assistants have the forms and once you've filled them out, I need to approve/sign them before going upstairs for approval. 3.)  All employee reviews should be completed by now for Directors/Managers/Associates/Analysts/ Assistants. All reviews should be written, signed by both the supervisor and employee, and given to Fran Mayes for filing.  Fran- If you have not received all written reviews by this Friday, please advise. This should include the 5 East Midstream groups and both the Gas and Power Structuring groups. We have just completed the VP PRC as of yesterday and I will be sitting down with each of the VP's for feedback over the next week. 4.) We are entering the homestretch for most of our deals this year and it is extremely important that we stay completely focused on doing everything possible to bring these deals to closure. Top priorities as I see them are as follows: Ozzie Pagan:  TexMex, Alamac/Cogentrix, Green Jacket, Brazos/Tenaska Jeff Ader:          NSTAR, CRRA,  Silver Oak, ConEd, NYSEG Bruce Sukaly:  AES-NY, Assets (Cinergy/Wilton Plant/ Pontiac/Plano, EPNG/Wheatland, etc), AEC Gil Muhl:            PSEG, NJN Laura Luce:      Manlove Storage Monetization, HUB deals Ben Jacoby:   Florida Merchant Plant, Continue building optionality on Site Bank, Coal Plant development Ed and Bernie: Continue to drive the commodity deals to closure We're definitely set up to execute on our 2000 business plan and strategy. The above deals are our #1 priority for the rest of the year. Let's stay very well coordinated on these deals and do everything we can to drive them to closure. Elevate any internal hurdles earlier rather than later and  I'll personally handle them. There are many other deals I'd like to also see closed ( Tangerine and Ft. Pierce - George McCormick, Vepco/NC - Heather Kroll, ANP-Mark Bernstein, VNG/AGL- Ed McMichael, TXU- Jim Ducote, Energen/Haywood - Healy/Jacoby) and many others I'd like to continue to see get teed up for next year. 5.)  Please forward any information above to your groups if appropriate. Thanks! 
David: As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel. We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people. Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list. The enclosed list indicates the current proposed ""New Roles"" for each of the Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees among: Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to complete) Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals LNG/Middle East to go to EGM Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses) EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain technical/operations people) The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to ensure that no individual falls through the cracks. The column ""Calme"" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and you may wish to ignore it. Please give me a call if you have any questions. Shawn 
Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market. All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities (including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC. Regards 
Guys, FYI - Ben, can you follow up with this person with our interest or lack thereof whichever is applicable. Regards Delainey 
Successfully, missed another bullet !!!  I have meetings set up with Mariel= la=20 (the lady you like) and Dan Castingnola, who are the two highest ranked=20 performers in CALME, to see if they are interested in joining our team. =20 Regards Delainey 
Guys, gas with a $5.00 handle is not a good thing for this deal - I know we are pushing this restructuring as fast as we can; however, I think we need to determine how to move this faster. Any ideas? Regards 
Jennifer, is there another time? Regards Delainey 
Tom , I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response. I am on-side with all your points.  On the New Albany retrofit, I want to ensure that I am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear ""title"" up front on the new equipment will be important.  However, I will be interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce NOX and increase our operating hours. I share your interest in the FT-4 project hopefully we can take that to the next level. Please stay in contact. Regards Delainey 
Dave, Thank you for taking the time to discuss the issues and opportunities facing our companies. I did not expect to have such an audience. I came seeking business advice on the litigation and feel I accomplished a lot more. I apologize for not contacting you directly, but I was unaware that you were now responsible for all of the groups within ENA.   Congratulations !!!!! Here is what I came away with: Litigation GE has proposed a settlement that includes a proposed press release unacceptable to PSM. I have our attorneys working on drafting a response to GE and pursing the possibility of eliminating the joint press release altogether. If common ground cannot be reached we will pursue other legal options. Private Placement The book has been released to Enron & Calpine. I understand your position concerning participation and the question of the ongoing litigation. I am very open to the additional warrant option. Mike Miller talked to me about it after the meeting and we will discuss it next week. New Albany Retrofit I have asked my engineers to formulate a plan to upgrade the units at New Albany with our latest 6 ppm liners and fuel nozzles. We are currently manufacturing a full set for a 7EA machine. We haven't firmed up the test dates but we need to seek approval by ENA & OEC to use one of the Doyle machines. This is a significant leap in technology that many of our clients are extremely interested in. We now have the only single digit dry low Nox system that can be used on multiple machine types to include Westinghouse 501D5A, ABB 11 N1/N2, GE F6 / F7. FT4 Mobile Unit I understand from Mike Miller you want to slow the pace down on the first ten units to ""Learn out"" the manufacturing and business process. This will ease our pain level on schedule. My engineering staff is very excited with this program because it involves aircraft engines and they can apply their true skills. We just hired the program manager named George Kirsby. He is currently in charge of the $4 billion Joint Strike Fighter engine design program for Pratt Whitney / Boeing. I figure he should be able to manage the mobile unit project. At some time in the near future I would like to arrange a program presentation for you in Houston. I need to give Kirsby a few weeks to get his arms around the project and will propose dates for you in the future. We need to expedite the formation of the Joint Venture company as we are already being approached with deals to place these units. I really value your support and you can always count on our loyalty to Enron.

efforts 
David, how are we making out with this item? Regards Delainey 
efforts Attached is a spreadsheet summarising the current volunteers from our operating companies for this coming season of campus recruiting efforts for Analysts and Associates. This information comes from the program and I am told is accurate as of last week. In speaking with many of you over the last few months, I believe it is fair to say we have agreed that it is critical for the senior management team to show their support for the program and be intimately involved in the recruiting process for new Analysts and Associates. In particular, many of you have remarked that we are generally short of these resources, as well as being short of specific skills which we need either in trading, finance, origination or assets to grow our businesses. In this regard, having reviewed the attached I would suggest that those of you that have not currently volunteered to join one of the school recruiting teams as well as many of our VP's who have not done so, are encouraged to step up immediately. In the spirit of cutting to the chase, here is my suggested additional participation, which with your support I will forward to Charlene's team and ask them to contact and make themselves available for the scheduled school presentation: Under Grad Florida  Colwell Vanderbilt Ader, Beyer Penn  Beirbach, Pagan Michigan Burnett, Bradley Baylor  Cocavessis Morehouse Gomez Uof H  Detmering MIT  Hermans Berkeley McDonald NYU  Kinneman Minnesota Ducote Carnegie Miller Grad Schools UCLA  Swerzbin Rice  Muhl, Duran Darden  Pruett Columbia Reck, Sharp Georgetown Shedd Harvard Luce, Josey Michigan Frevert, Parquet MIT  Tricoli, Milnthorp Wharton Kitagawa, Malcolm Vanderbilt McClellan, Oxley Let me know if you think any of these are inappropriate. I will update this based on any feedback and contact the individuals directly early next week to let them know we would appreciate their help in these efforts. David 
Carol, I believe Hunter is leading the charge on building the gas fundamentals group. Regards Delainey 
Dave- Thank you for taking the time last week to speak at the floor meeting on 29. I come from an engineering background and work in a financial reporting role for Andrea Reed. I have found the transition from engineering to finance at Enron a natural one with my eye on details and the analysis process. I have attached Gwen Weddington's resume which I would like to pass on to the Fundamentals Group for the Gas Business, which you mentioned is now being formed. I think that she could be a valuable addition to Enron. She is currently an Operations Manager at Air Products and Chemicals' Industrial Chemicals Group. Can you tell me to whom I should forward this? Thanks, Carol 3-4291 
4 September, 2000 Carol Marshall Enron Houston, TX Dear Carol: I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you on Friday.  As I mentioned, I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with Air Products and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have read about Enron.  Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends who might be kind enough to ""keep their eyes open"" and share thoughts and ideas as to companies I should contact. I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.  As you can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong operations background.  I would certainly enjoy another position as an Operations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well. I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range of industries.  Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would be very encouraging.  I am open to any avenues you suggest. Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.  It seems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few select introductions.  Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or who can direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.  The more contacts I make, the more opportunities I can uncover. If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.  I will contact you again in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.  Thank you in advance for your help.

David , if this is going to cause you political flack with Mary Joyce lets just kill it - we have revised the original plan and this is probably not needed. Regards Delainey 
David, I need more information on the project and who exactly the individuals are who you feel should participate in this program.  Generally, developers and deal people throughout the company are not provided with additional incentive since this type of work is part of their job.  However, this project may be an exception.  Please call and lets discuss. Thanks! MAry David Oxley@ECT 08/30/2000 09:21 AM 
I have been discussing with Dave Delainey how we might align the compensation/rewards for the group of 4 or 5 VP's and Directors we have assigned to disposing of our large portfolio ($650mm). The project is due to complete in June 01 and Dave and my concern is whether we can make sure they are motivated to close on time and get the best possible price for us. Dave believe the up side could be as much as $150mm and the downside as much as $300mm (the difference between best and worst prices/sales). My suggestion is that we do the following and I would like your comments or concerns if any: Enter into contracts or an agreement (the later would be one way - us to them and obviously easier) with each of them outlining the following: Bonus targets based on financial targets and PRC performance for calendar 01 (ie if you rank in top 3 categories and you realise over $650 from this project we will pay you not less than $300k) Equity award on closing, on the basis of successful closure and above line value (ie only in the event that this closes in June 01 and realises more than $650mm we will grant you $200k in options, if above $800m then $350k in options.) Dave would like for me to get back to him on this asap. David 
Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your thoughts on your current role.  I have heard you are considering global fuels and Lagrasta's business.  I would like to give you my perspective on the future vision for power and the overall organization including gas mid-market. Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years. Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience. Regards 
As per our discussion. 
I am no longer coordinating the ""next-year"" activities for new hires in the gas group so I thought I'd just let you know that the Midwest gas team is interviewing new hires for coverage/origination roles. I believe Laura is wanting to hire some of these folks to be based in Chicago and I would think you would want them to be located in Houston. Just fyi. 
Kay, can you set up a one hour to half an hour with each if possible. Regards Delainey 
Kay, Dave asked me to send you a note to set up meetings for him with two of our executives:  Mariella Mahan and Dan Castagnola. It sounded like he was thinking about Friday. Shawn

Patience my friend - before a meaningful change can occur in the A/A program some of the changes in the EI groups need to be resolved.  That process is underway - I envision taking a comprehensive solution to Jeff towards the end of this quarter with Charlene on side.  I will discuss with you when I have more details. Regards Delainey 
Attorney-Client Protected Kevin, If we respond to the RFP with what we believe to be market prices and values and they don't accept it - does that not support a case where damages from the MOPA , for that 500 MW, can be defined to be equal to or lower than our submission. Regards Delainey 
Rick, it looks like the number is approximately down $198MM.  What is the drill? Regards 
Mark, go ahead and set up the meeting. 
Kevin, shouldn't we participate in this RFP? Regards Delainey 
I don't think we can accomodate that request.  :) Regards 
Don, give Harry some $$'s Regards Delainey 
Don: I do think DealBench was extremely valuable - and I'll say we - ENA - but what I really mean is you could not have gotten there nearly as quickly without it.  I think you agree.  By the same token, if they said 'free' up front, we don't have to pay.  I think this is really a negotiation between Dave and Greg if we want to move income to DealBench. Jeff Don Miller 12/04/2000 03:17 PM 
Jeff, What are your thought on this?  Let's talk about it. Don 
Chuck, I appreciate the note - I just like to ensure that everyone is aware of the various issues and that we are managing our risk appropriately.  I have a great deal of confidence that you have this handled. Regards Delainey 
I wasn't sure whether you were messing with me or serious during the QBR about the Ada boiler pump.  It was a $10k issue which was fixed in the normal course of operations and NBD in the scope of things.  The QF was never at risk as the pump is a standard part which is commonly available. The QF loss issue I typically worry about usually derive from an outage sourced at the counterparty level (cashflow problems, operational difficulties, etc.)  I've seen this cause a few projects tense moments, although FERC has always allowed the projects to recover.  Typically the utility will protest the loss of QF but since the QF's are self-certifying with FERC right to protest, the utility can typically only make noise and or cease paying. Recently, FPL attempted to not let the Indiantown QF IPP back on-line after a technical shutdown (and thereby bust their QF), but FPL lost their case in court (wrongful act) and has had to let the project return to on-line status (financing and QF remained intact over the +6 month ordeal). To me the general theme is that an executed and performing (energy is being delivered) PPA will survive incredible QF stress.  The plant managers typically have the highest level of understanding of the intricacies of the PPA's vis-a-vis the relationship between plant, utility and QF host. Historically, FERC is not looking to kick out a project's contract based upon a QF technicality, although charged with enforcement of QF.  If FERC was a tough enforcer, Cleburne and a few other similar QF projects would rate high on their hit list and the past speaks well to the future in this case. Chuck

This is the original memo sent to all the committee members from Dave.  I then sent out another one cancelling the Staff Meeting for all those not included in this memo. I also sent out a memo regarding the newly formed ENA Management Committee,  including the assistants,  so everyone would be on board. Let me know if this isn't what you needed. Thanks, Kay David W Delainey 08/15/2000 02:05 PM 
As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on this Friday. Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire meeting and to be on time. Regards Delainey 
Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable. The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change. The benefits include: a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, Capstone and Elektryon; b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer applications; c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk; d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize; e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology; and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture. However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture, it is worth the initial work. Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause at a fixed number for their 50% . If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I will set up a meeting. Regards 
Hey, you guys are copying my model! Congrats Regards Delainey 
Barry, we currently have six folks coming who all golf: - Barry - Lavo - Delainey - Ozzie - Milly - Yzaguirre I would say we should golf everday. I will get Kay to forward travel schedules to you so that we can set up times where everyone can play as much as possible.  My understanding is that we are all staying at the Mirage. Regards Delainey 
Dave, both Rob and I have booked for Vegas.  We will get in on Thurs. afternoon and leave Sunday AM ( millly ) and Afternoon for me. John called me yesterday and he wants to Golf, Fri, Sat, Sun. 1. We now have 5 people right?   Even if we have 5 it will be fine. Davies is still considering this ( I will let you know ). 2.  I will look into golf arrangements once we have a firmer head count and determine when to play.. When and how often do you want to golf ? Milly and I are up for playing every day. I am thinking Friday afternoon. Saturday afternoon, and Sunday am ( 10:00 or so ). There is a great golf course ( TPC @ Canyons ) that I am trying to get us on.  The Desert Inn is closed while we are there. Thanks, TIC 
Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an additional two weeks starting today. Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the winter season.  I will take your lead on this one. Regards 
thanks Ray 
Kay, please book 9:00 am to 2:00 pm with me Mike Miller & Don Miller with Mike Childers (Entergy) (actually 10 am to 1pm not including travel time to their shop in the Woodlands) on September 5, 2000. Regards 
Guys, can you come explain some of this to me including where we stand on the GE issues. Regards Delainey 
Scott, great job - looking for more. Regards Delainey 
Dave, FYI, On Tuesday, I pulled the trigger on the VPP for Crescendo.  The total was just in excess of $8,000,000.  I have executed ISDA for the financial swaps and am awaiting final doc's for the Enfolio Master Agreement for execution. I have passed this on to Lavorato.  The transaction proceeded fairly smoothly.  I have met with John Arnold on the best means of working with his group.  He suggested that we continue to work through Fred.  Fred, John Prevatt, and Arnold were very helpful in enabling me to pull the trigger at the peak of the curve on Tuesday.  I am no longer ""spec - ing"" gas.  It was fun while it lasted. I will keep you posted. Scott

Adam, thanks for the response, I guess it is a good thing for Enron that we didn't do this deal with TXU.  Nevertheless, I hope that we can find a way through this without significantly impairing value for ENA.  The ENA team will work with you on this item;however, I need your committment to try and keep us whole as much as possible. Regards Delainey 
Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the $26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way forward.  Adam David W Delainey@ECT 08/21/2000 09:49 AM 
Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten. I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU. I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse. Regards Delainey

Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the $26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way forward.  Adam David W Delainey@ECT 08/21/2000 09:49 AM 
Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten. I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU. I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse. Regards Delainey 
Rebecca, looks fine to me. Regards 
Steve, I appreciate the offer - I  hope you didn't have to promise your first born since I was basically giving you a hard time.  I may take you up on this next season.  Regardless, I appreciate all the good work you and your team are doing. Regards

Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other business lines.  If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy. I make money you make money. Thanks for your cooperation. Regards Delainey

Dave, I am down for 9:00 AM for a couple of hours on Tuesday.  I am assuming that this includes my senior team (Parquet, Mcdonald, Vickers, Thomas).  I am correct? Regards, Chris PS - I spoke with Tim and we will be ready to price energy and ancilleries with respect to SDG&E.  I will work with Steffes on timing, pr and SDG&E strategy.  Sorry I sounded negative, but I was voicing Tim's concern as well.  Our risk is significant; we just dont want to make it worse. 
Guys, we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing your services as owners engineer on the Vitro project.  I will honor our agreement on the sell down; however, we have sufficient technical talent internally and externally to manage this job.  I see very little effort in continuing to waste internal time in ENA and EECC on this discussion. Regards Delainey 
Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.  The West historically has been far better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market deals/services.  I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.  I would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow, resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting. Regards Delainey 
Per Mark Frank's request here is a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR Thanks Mary Kay 
David, I would change John Thompson and Ed Baughman to strong. Thxs Delainey 
Presumably you still want Thompson moved to Strong? 
Got your voice mail.  Changing John Thompson's rating is a simple matter at this point-then we'll redo the graphs and clusters.    We will make the change from Satisfactory to Strong.  Do you anticipate any others? Gina 
Guys, we need your final review on next years budget (direct expense) for MW Gas (Luce) and LT Gas Fundamentals/Transport Capacity (Gomez) done today.  We are running out of time to finalize the budgeting process.  I would much appreciate your assistance. Regards 
Mike, lets discuss just after Wayne and I get together to discuss the technical book or in conjunction. Regards Delainey 
Dave and Dave, Wayne Mays and I are trying to assess technical support requirements for the next 12-24 months.  We would like to talk with each of you to get you input on the direction the company is going, and what type and level of support is likely to be required as we go forward. If possible, we'd like to schedule a brief (30 minute) conference call, preferably within the next week, with each of you to discuss these issues. If you have a time that would be convenient, please let me and/or Wayne know so that we can get it scheduled. Thanks! Mike Coleman 
Chris, where are we on gas interconnect?   I am hearing rumblings of 15 year Kern exposure - don't  know if I like that. Regards 
Janet, it may be in your personal interest to ensure that a number of witnesses are available to ensure the message is delivered and there is not confusion in the future. Regards Delainey 
Ok. Laura Luce is flying in as we speak and she should have the written feedback drafts for both Cary Carrabine and Russell Murrell (Needs Improvement for Manager level). The plan was for both Laura and I together to meet with Cary next week, and Laura will be meeting with Russell and I may end up meeting with Russell afterwards. We will have the final written feedback to Fran by end of next week, after the employee meetings. I hadn't planned for David Oxley to be in the meeting with Cary. If you feel that is necessary just let me know. Thanks. 
Ben, can you spend a little time and give me some feedback on this item. Regards Delainey

Guys, my suggestion would be that RAC should manage the overall monitoring responsibility for ENA;however, I assume that Janet and Chris will continue to be responsible for the ENA turbine book.  They should be actively managing and monitoring ENA's piece. Regards Delainey 
Thanks for the note Mat.  Look fwd to supporting your effort as needed! Just to insure that ENA and RAC aren't duplicating efforts...., we have been told by Rick Buy that he wanted RAC to keep the Enron Turbine ""book"" (with input from other business units), and have just concluded multiple sessions w/ RAC to xfer that function to them (I think we invited your team to those sessions).  Rick Carson/RAC is working on a format that can be used by multiple parties, including board presentations.  The idea was that different business units (ENA,, EECC, etc) could provide input, and....., RAC's involvement would enhance the list. If ENA is going to keep ""the turbine book"" - maybe RAC doesn't need to (none of our business, but...., doesn't seem like RAC needs to be doing the same thing you are doing). Who from ENA could discuss this w/ Dave Gorte (Rick's on vacation)? Also - do you have a rep that can attend the bi-weekly turbine lunches where we go through the list - coordinating turbine efforts across all business units? Thanks - F.Kelly Mathew Gimble@ECT 08/15/2000 05:14 PM 
Tammy Shepperd and myself have been asked to maintain the status of Enron's turbine position.  This list includes the 24 LM6000s, all other ENA turbines and all Enron turbines to the extent information is available.  The file includes 3 worksheets: Turbine Inventory:  lists the turbine, delivery, ownership, project commitment and other related items. LM6000 Status:  includes delivery, configuration, project commitment and other related items. LM6000 Assign:  less detailed schedule with the delivery, project commitment and current availability. In the future, to maintain the integrity of this information, the file will NOT be emailed, but will accessible from the following location in a Read Only format: O:\NAES\Master Turbine Listing.xls It is our view that requiring users to access the actual directory will be the most efficient method of assuring the user is receiving up-to-date information.  As project needs arise or change, please email or contact Tammy Shepperd at (713) 853-6589 or myself at (713) 853-3526.  In addition, if there is other information that would be useful, let us know.

This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting August 18, 2000. This meeting replaces the every Friday Meeting and will be held every other Friday. 
Mark, this is great - giving the increased exposure/politics in some of these markets it makes a lot of sense. Regards Delainey 
As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on this Friday. Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire meeting and to be on time. Regards 
Dave: The Cuiaba meeting is on Monday at 3:00 pm.  Location to be determined.  I will forward the location ASAP. Jim

Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group. I think this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.

Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading. It is not a bad model just a different one. Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall Street. Regards Delainey 
What do you guys think of the conclusion here re the need for large asset portfolios? - - -DLH 
David:  This is a very intersting article for you to consider when the management considers what businesses Newco should include.  This article suggests that a combination of physical assets and trading are best.  That may  be true for US and Europe markets, but maybe not for lesser developed countries.

I will be in Houston next week and we can discuss if you want to.  The idea here was not to explain the retail product offering or any concern of dropping the ball, rather a one off download of where we currently stand in South America  and high level overview of  how to work together to keep everyone on the same sheet of music and not miss  a beat.  For instance, there is already a local staff in place to handle initial deal flow (which is already happening) that needs to benefit from Dan's systems and best practices, but which has already based what they are doing on how Dan operates.  We have always benefited from as much of Dan's and Marty's attention as we could get over the past year and a half as we set this up. By the same token we can't be competitive in this business in Brazil on a cost basis from Houston, so that is why we have formed local staff based on EES systems and practices, and hopefully some controls as we go forward.  It is late here and my assistant is gone but I think the meeting is already scheduled.  If you can't be there maybe we can backbrief you. David W Delainey@ECT 11/30/2000 11:21 AM 
Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff. Regards Delainey 
My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001. Key points for discussion will be: -brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America -brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report through wholesale -discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the retail business a success: -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those involved present on the call/meeting. 
Jeff, you are killing me - we targeted that group specifically to build the risk business in gas and east power in the short run.  This was well planned effort. Regards Delainey 
Dave and John, I spoke to Jeff Shenkman and he has indicated that the following new associates are to support him in his role in Global Markets: Dustin Collins Vikas Dwivedi Li Sun Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are identified in our system.

Currently, Enron has several contractual disputes with Siemens/Westinghouse. These include:  $5-10MM lingering from Marmara; about $4-5MM on Puerto Rico; and maybe $1-3MM on the Gleason and Indiana Peakers. In my meeting with Randy Zwirn yesterday, Randy suggested that I meet with him in an attempt to come to a global settlement on all the Enron disputes. I propose to do this.  I understand the strength of the contractual issues on each of these projects and I think I can close out the issues by optimizing the Enron leverage in one global settlement.  The process will take from 30-60 days as both sides collect all contractual arguments. I'll keep ENA informed. Let me know if either of you object to this global type approach. LI35700 
Margaret, what is involved with this Permanent Residency application?  How does it change my status as a non-immigrant resident? Regards Delainey 
Dave:  Further to our conversation today, I checked with our immigration attorneys, and they confirm that the maximum extension for an L1 visa is two years at a time. However, they did suggest that you might like to consider a Permanent Residency application for a Multi-national Executive.  If you would like to pursue this avenue, please let me know and we can proceed. If you have any further questions, please call me at x55083. Margaret Daffin 
Janet, get rid of these LM's - too many cooks! Regards Delainey 
Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then ultimately in origination. I hope this helps. Regards Delainey 
Dave- You mentioned in enside that some of the skills needed to succeed at Enron are solid structuring skills as well as a grasp of the the accounting, legal, commercial and credit implications of a deal.  What is the best way to obtain these skills?  Do you believe it is necessary or worthwhile to work a trading desk to truly understand how ENA functions? Thanks, Joe Short

Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC. Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business is the perview of ECC. Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done and can help in the pitch. Regards Delainey 
Dave, my thoughts regarding your note: This is not what we agreed to in Columbia Lakes. You were very clear on the point that ENA Industrial Marketing had enough to do South of the border. We have staffed up our Industrial Marketing Team in Toronto and are covering all industrials (on a full-time basis) which meet our load threshold in Ontario. Unlike the U.S., Ontario is a relatively small market where we can and have complete coverage. Paul and his group have done a tremendous job at positioning Enron in this marketplace, demonstrating our core competencies, and developing credibility. The last thing I want is some marketer up here from the U.S. selling the box without knowing how to fill that box (ie does not know the market fundamentals, rules or regulatory regime). This does nothing for Enron as it confuses the customer on who they should be talking to and destroys whatever credibility we had created to date. I have attached for your reference, a status report on industrial coverage. Perhaps the problem lies in how we are defining outsourcing. As you know, there exists a continuum from portfolio management through to the energy island concept. Enron Canada has been pitching the entire outsourcing continuum recognizing that for many of these industrials, they will want to walk before they run. The majority that we have talked to are interested in portfolio management, our market expertise & information, wholesale settlement services, and assistance with market opening readiness. I cant imagine how a U.S. originator could talk to or offer these services to Canadian Industrials. This is clearly in Enron Canada's wheelhouse. With respect to the opposite side of the outsourcing continuum, it makes total sense to have ENA utilize its resources in pursuing energy island, asset outsourcing type structures. With these opportunities, I see ENA taking the lead with ECC second chair. Where these opportunities are identified by ECC, we will forward these to the appropriate ENA originator. To date, ENA and ECC have worked well on Blue Circle, Terra, Co-Steel and Nexfor. As for Tembec, I am confused with what you mean by not changing the deal team. Kelli Metcalf has been up here twice talking to Tembec about a cogen in an area that does not make any economic sense. Jan and Paul have met with Tembec a number of times and we have had extensive discussions with Tembec specific to Ontario, Portfolio Management, Wholesale Settlement Services, Supply Procurement, and Asset Optimization. I realize that Bryan Burnett has an excellent relationship with Tembec and we should leverage off of this, but to simply ""keep ECC in the loop"" is fundamentally absurd and is not in Enron's best interests. Regards Milnthorp David W Delainey 08/03/2000 12:09 PM 
Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes: a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination; b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron Mexico; c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer (ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for Canada and Mexico; and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to ECC. Regards Delainey 
Dave, attached is some of the background correspondence in anticipation of our meeting with Brian Burnett. Regards Milnthorp 
Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows: 1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian Facilities. 2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only. 3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs to be co-ordinated. Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US facilities. It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing arrangement. Regards, Angela McCulloch for  Rob Milnthorp Assistant to Rob Milnthorp (403) 974-6738 
Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps and to some extent, new SPV's. In this instance, 1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company 2.  All their assets are in Canada 3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility 4.  We know the executive team at Tembec 5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy market which is their focus right now 6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement similar to the US pitches With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck. However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this office!!! I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the meeting and deliver the ""Enron"" message, but going forward we need to have this resolved. Cheers, Paul D 
I agree 400% - I look forward to your plan.

Even though FERC has approved EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh into the Calif ISO and Calif PX. Government Affairs is responding in two ways -- 1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our market-based rate authority. 2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by SDG&E) and poor market structure rules. The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid August. This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will discuss this with you. Call with questions. Thanks, Jim 
Larry, my understanding is that ESA has taken four units and that Janet Dietrich in conversations with ESA has made four more available to ESA subject to them getting their deal approved by the board.  So I do not believe Enron needs to committ to additional LM units at this time. Regards Delainey 
Guys, although I am hesitant to get in between ESA and ENA on this issue, my perception is that there is some confusion; we need to sort out at the top. Let me describe what I understand of the facts. First, ESA is coordinating a DASH through the RAC for eight LM 6000's. Second, ENA has a list of 24 LM 6000's; the ""ready to ship date"" as shown on the following attachment; but only four of these are earmarked for ESA, as far as I understand. Third, GE/S&S has approached me and is willing to sell us more LM 6000's if we need to.  The ""ready to ship dates"" for these new LM 6000's are between January - March, 2001.  We could possibly get these at the current preferred pricing (as a current contract change order). ESA and ENA should discuss whether or not either party wants to buy some of the new LM 6000's that are now available for delivery between January - March, 2001.  Does ENA want to substitute any of these for LM 6000's currently on hand and not allocated to ESA?  Is ENA earmarking four additional LM 6000's on the attached list to ESA, and if so, which ones?  If not, does ESA want EECC to secure any or all of the remaining units required, which we can do quickly, off the balance sheet. My perception is that there is confusion and not clear direction, I recommend that both of you have a discussion and establish a clear definition of what we are doing with the LM 6000's and whether either of you want to entertain the purchase of the new LM 6000's.  Let me know if I can help. LI34400 
How do like that ..... I like this guy. 
Dave, Thanks for taking time to have dinner with us last night. I learned a tremendous amount about ENA and the strategic vision for the company. It is reassuring to know that we have such competent leaders at the helm. Thanks Again, John Massey 
Let me know your thoughts after you speak with him. Regards Delainey 
Dave, Here is the list of folks involved in Cuiaba. Laine Powell and his team - Project execution team for Cuiaba, located in Cuiaba Jose Anson - Develpment -  Engineering/Permitting Joan Carlos Albuquerque - FURNAS/Eletrobra relationship Valeria Lima - ANP relationship Daine Duarte - Local in Cuiaba.  Sounds like formally part of Lammers' team, but practically part of Laine's team Jose Lucio dos Reis Neto - Agencies involved in electric system operation. Recovery oil fuel oil costs (complicated story/very important task) Jose Bestard - Project continuity.  Original PPA negotiations John Novak - Lawyer...key to financing Rob Gay - Financing lead...key to financing Rick Lammers - Commercial project lead I sent this on top of Pete Weidler's e-mail and summarized a good part of it above.  Only Lammers and Gay were not mentioned in Pete's e-mail. Another thought...pull people in from EE&CC as part of the ""new team"".  No basis in fact here, but I suspect there are too many contractor/owner games going on.  Probably need the EE&CC key people list as well.  Do you want me to shake it loose, do you want to work it with Leff, or bad idea? Let me know if you have any additional questions. Thanks, KIsh 
Joe - this is the list I asked Laine to put together. - I asked him not to list all the folks under Laine - as I assume they stay with the project no matter where it goes. Jose Anson - he is the coordinator of permitting at IBAMA and ANP for the pipeline.  He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of his efforts on the IBAMA license.  Key person. Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.  Not only does he know folks but he also gets things done within the system. Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP. Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the year after which she has been dialed out.  Have asked Rick several times about her future with his group.  She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al. Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.  He has been a key to our success on the CCC account.  He is a must to making the project successful.  Knows the contacts and basically understands the project from the regulatory and CCC account point-of-view. Two other people that are not involved in ""our side"" of fence on a daily basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.  Jose knows the history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project. Pete Joe Kishkill 11/27/2000 06:16 AM 
Pete, But you (or does anyone) have a definitive team list for Cuiaba?  Need this for transition planning purposes.  I agree with your sentiment that some folks may be pulling double duty while we button up Cuiaba.   Just need to know ""how many"" and ""who"". Thanks, Kish Peter E Weidler 11/26/2000 09:07 PM 
we can do this by phone. Pete 
Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon. The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and John.     Can divide the presentation up into - getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - Laine Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose Current economics. - Rick Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we send the page per topic around by this friday. I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know. Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking. Pete 
Fred, I will research our potential needs otherwise I agree with your approach to keep the option open for as long as possible. Regards Delainey 
Need input if anyone thinks we need more turbines than John Schroeder/GE has forecasted.  My gut feel is that John has forecasted more turbines than we will need (which is OK). The GE planning Boys called John and asked him to check with Enron....... and determine if Enron wanted any turbines in the 2002/2003 timeframe (the previous assumption being 7F's wouldn't be available till 4Q03, and 7EA's wouldn't be available till 1Q03).  John stated that he didn't know what the request from Schenectady meant....., but....., maybe a few production slots were coming available as things shake out.....  John told them that he thought Enron might be interested in: qty 4 7EA's and qty 4 7F's for ESA qty 2 7EA's and qty 2 7F's for Mexico qty 6 7EA's and qty 6 7F's for NA John is asking us........, ""that would be enough...... right?"".  We don't need to change that input (from John Schroeder to Schenectady) if we want less than he forecasted, but....., if someone knows something I don't, and....., we would want more turbines than the above......., please let us know. On an immediate basis, John also stated that he had requests in for turbines for Saudi, and....., ""an island project"". Regards - F.Kelly 
Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes: a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination; b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron Mexico; c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer (ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for Canada and Mexico; and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to ECC. Regards Delainey 
Dave, attached is some of the background correspondence in anticipation of our meeting with Brian Burnett. Regards Milnthorp 
Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows: 1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian Facilities. 2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only. 3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs to be co-ordinated. Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US facilities. It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing arrangement. Regards, Angela McCulloch for  Rob Milnthorp Assistant to Rob Milnthorp (403) 974-6738 
Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps and to some extent, new SPV's. In this instance, 1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company 2.  All their assets are in Canada 3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility 4.  We know the executive team at Tembec 5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy market which is their focus right now 6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement similar to the US pitches With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck. However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this office!!! I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the meeting and deliver the ""Enron"" message, but going forward we need to have this resolved. Cheers, Paul D 
Jeff, we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and I need to know if you want Breslau.  I would like him in a singular role and accountability so I need to plan to incorporate him or not depending on if you want him. Regards 
Kay, please have Jordan forward this in hard copy to your attention.  In don't need to be in the e-mail loop. Thanks Delainey 
Dave/Kay,  This expense report has already been approved and returned to us. Please forward to ""Expense Report"" for processing. Thanks, Darlene 
Charlie, your call - just a question 
Dave: Our term sheets tend to be very general until we reach some sort of economic deal.  Our group has tended to work this way, but I am willing to add more detail as you suggested. Regards, Charlie David W Delainey 08/01/2000 06:07 PM 
Charlie, looks pretty general - only comment is what is the Product Purchase Agreement entail? Do we want to go into more detail on the nature of the alliance, the target market and the nature of the excusivity (ie) wholesale renewables applications, ENA, major state programs - all of it based upon the Conneticut job working? Regards Delainey 
Please review.  I believe this term sheet is in line with our discussions earlier today. 
please put on schedule 
David, I want to enforce this to nth degree given his understanding of our industrial offering and that fact he mis-represented his reasons for leaving. Regards Delainey 
Seems Jim Derrick got a call last night from Chief Legal Counsel at Reliant saying that Jim would be joining them to develop something similar to an EES business for them and wanted to discuss our no-compete. I have told Michele that we will want to apply the full force of the no-compete which should keep him out of the market thru Feb 3, 2001. I'll keep you updated. David 
Edward, you are very welcome and I appreciate all the efforts to ensure the transition works and we get the accounting treatment we want on Garden State. Regards Delainey

Wes, as per our discussion, I wanted to detail the action items from the analysis: a) the Office of the Chairman will be increasing the visibility of ROCE and cost metrics as a part of the QBR process; b) the ROCE iniatives include: - HPL divestment - Donahue/Detmering/Redmond; - GENCO strategy or possible peaker sales - Donahue/Miller; - MPR rationalization, Raptor strategy and divestment/clean-up - Donahue/Maffitt/Peterson - LRC optimization, increased performance - Redmond/Mrha; -Sithe restructuring, elimination of the tracking account - Donahue; - Powder and Wind River sales - Redmond/Mrha. c) specific cost reduction iniatives as detailed in your presentation - implement with feedback/measurement process to ensure buy in - Wes Colwell; and d) further analysis on quality of product/service for cost for non-commercial and group expenses - Wes Colwell. Regards 
Rick, we have re-examined the portfolio as a result of our last meeting and have an expected portfolio of $500M (gross) or $408M (net-ENA's share) to be placed into Raptor on September 1.  We have a second tranche of $608M (gross) or $396M (net ENA's share) to be placed into Raptor 2 on December 1. Kafus, Ecogas, Brigham, Crown Energy and Merlin CLO Equity Option will not be part of either Raptor 1 or Raptor 2. Please confirm that this is consistent with you view of capacity and timing. Regards 
Brian, great job - I would really like to get this done for third quarter please let me know how I can help.  I have heard that you can request a expedited HSR for fairly straight forward deals like this. Wes, I believe that we don't have any issues recognizing the value from this transaction - please confirm. Regards Delainey 
Julie and Jean, Pursuant to our telephone conversation this morning, this e-mail is intended to update the status of project 20/20. There are 6 major items that need to be completed prior to closing this transaction.  The items and the expected completion dates are outlined below: Closing Item   Expected Completion Date Status 1. Execution of LOU  August 4   Several issues remain to be negotiated. I do not anticipate any problem in reaching mutual agreement on the issues. Border meets with their audit committee on August 2 and hopes to sign August 3. Will be in the position to review with you and Dave on August 1 or 2. 2. Employment Issues  August 14   Offers of employment/transfer are in the process of being designed and prepared. Primary         issues include a) identification and handling of ENA end-of-year bonus compensation (Shiela         Knudson is coordinating this and I feel this issue is being adequately addressed). b) potential disparity between GPG and ENA incentive compensation plans. I am working with Bill         Cordes and Ann Vaughn w/ GPG on developing a plan that will address this issue.  Based on the conference call with Bill and Ann this morning, I am optimistic that this issue will be properly         addressed.  The plan is to have employment issues identified in a letter and presented to          employees on August 7th. 3. Reserve Consultants  August 11   Kicked off consultants in a meeting in Omaha on July 26th. We are providing information and         assisting in the process. 4. Due Diligence  August 25   A detailed schedule of all due diligence activity is being updated by Northern Border and I will         forward that schedule to you once I receive the update. 5. Hart, Scott Rodino  September 8-15   There is a high probability that a Hart, Scott, Rodino filing will have to be made upon execution of         the LOU. There is a 30 day review period.  This may be the critical path item. 6. Drafting/Negotiating PSA September 8-15   Shonnie Daniel is coordinating the drafting of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. It is expected         that this agreement will be agreed upon in early to mid September. One key date you should be aware of is Northern Border is anticipating making a press release after the LOU is executed (release date is expected to be August 7).  They will be coordinating press release issues with Eric Thode. I feel confident that this transaction will be closed in September. If you have any questions, please let me know. 
Jennifer, you are very welcome and I look forward to continuing to work with you - all the best. Regards 
Dawn, right now I am scheduled to be up in Calgary on the 16th of August - lets shoot for that date. Regards Delainey 
Hi Dave, Milly's 5 year anniversary is August 1st.  Any trips to Canada planned around then?  How do you want to deliver his service award?  He selected the pen/pencil set.  Let me know how you want to handle it...... 
Rebecca, if you wouldn't mind I would like to sit in on the Monday meeting. I think that Mariella from what I have seen and heard is very capable.  I strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated (with fresh eyes) SWAT team on this one that has control of the complete commercial, technical and financial aspects of this project.  This is the only way to be effective. Whether it is with you or me or both, I am indifferent I would like to ensure that Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzales and Alberquerque are not buried in this project given other goals and objectives. Thanks Regards Delainey 
Dave, I am sorry that I was unable to meet with you yesterday on Cuiba.  Jim has told me what the two of you decided and it is fine with me.  Below is a note that I received this morning from Pete.  The meeting he is referencing is an indepth update on the project that I requested a week ago.  You are more than welcome to attend if you would like to - just let me know. I am not sure that Pete is the right guy to work this or not, but I do agree that we need to introduce someone else into the process - I am thinking either Chris Hunt or Mariella Mahan.  I would be happy to discuss with you why I recommend one of those two individuals. Rebecca 
the list below is going to Delainey - it is accurate from my perspective - if the project ends up in your shop for completion and fixing up - and if it ends up under me - some of these part time guys should become full time and some of the full time guys should take a back seat. I would have the full time dedicated team be - Jose Bestard (he currently is chief of regulatory for South America) - he negotiated the original PPA and has indepth knowledge of how the regulatory system does and does not work. Joao Carlos Alberquerque - top notch Brazilian power expert - has the right contacts and relationships and can get us through the maze of Brazilian resistance.  Currently he is headed for wholesale merchant. John Novak - best legal mind - needs to curb the use of outside lawyers a bit - has been on the project continuous from day one - and needs to be rejuvenated a bit - but has thourough understanding of how bthe entire project is wired together. Rob Gay - Finance Laine Powell - is currently President of the oeprating companies - Cuiaba is producing 300 mw of power which is being sold and paid for. Felipe Ospina - modeler - I don't know this guy -  he is relatively new to the project and seems satisfactory Would recommend also a fresh set of eyes on the project - not front line negotiator - but someone good at structuring - or work outs - to review overall project structure objectively and challange conventional wisdom. Other folks on the list below can support the dedicated team - part time. Would tell these guys - this is your only job - and here is your starting point - new deal.  Your job is not just to close financing - it is to get Enron's money out or otherwise improve the returns of the project.    You will get paid based on this point forward.   It will take at least 9 months to implement a solution that improves our returns or gest more than just financial close achieved. This leaves some sticky situations - Rick Lammers has absolutely busted his ass getting things done and moving the project forward - he has been lead developer - but has had lots of ""help"" from Bannantine and the entire team. Help tended to obscure responsibility and accountability.  I am not sure anyone could have gotten this thing done by now - but certainly there were some things that could have been done better - in 20/20 hindsight  - and some things that can be done better now.  The things that come be done better now - I am pushing into Laines's area of responsibility this week.  People need to get rededicated and fired back up - I also think it is kind of difficult to ""take over"" the project without making some changes in the way it is being run. For the review on Monday - I have asked the following people to present - Rick Lammers Laine Powell Jose Bestard Also in attendance will be John Novak, Joe Kishkill, Brett Wiggs, Rob Gay and myself. The guys asked if Jim Bannantine should be present - I said no - let me know if you would like him there. You should see - a brief description of the overall project (not the strategy - just how it is wired together- where the money is intended to be be) and 
To all, Here is the Cuiaba I Team....Miguel 
Cuiaba 1 team currently consists of: Rick Lammers -lead developer john novak- legal Rob G Gay- Finance part time Traci Bersoni- support Finance part time Stephen Gray- support Finance part time Felipe Ospina- project analyst Gabriela Aguilar  -support -gas part time Emmanuel Rengade- Sudam financing and Equity Sale Marcus Stephen-Sudam financing and Equity Sale Joao Carlos Alberquerque- support PPA Jose Bestard- support PPA and regulatory Asset management Laine A Powell-construction management and operations Christiaan Huizer-Project analyst Let me know if I can help furtherh 
Mark, note the feedback from the AA's, it is imperative that we get a handle on this!  Let me know when I can spring our plan on Jeff. Regards Delainey 
Attached is a memo regarding a meeting I had with our associates on July 17, 2000.  Additionally, I met with Celeste Roberts on July 21 and held another meeting with the Associates on same date. The planned dinners with the associates as well as the proactive approach ENA is taking with them is the correct course of action. Jere 
I met with 7 associates and 1 analyst  over lunch to discuss the Analyst and Associate Program.  The major concern expressed by everyone in the meeting was that the program has become a bureaucracy vs a meritocracy.  According to the Associates, the program has become inflexible on any issue and the only feedback they receive is ""go talk to Skilling if you don't like the answers"".  Another major concern was compensation.  After listening to the comments, my conclusion is that there are some problems that need to be addressed.  Specific recommendations by this small group include (1) reduce amount of time in program before promotion to manager from 18 months to 12 months, (2) increase Associates involvement in rotation decisions, (3) explanations of why the program is structured in a certain way without defensive comments of ""go talk to Skilling"", (4) generally, more of an open market approach so that we are using a ""carrot vs stick"" method to motivate behavior. Let me know about the next meeting to discuss. Jere 
As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts. In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A resource requests from your team before passing them onto us. In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply their name as soon as possible. Please call with any questions. 
Kay, make sure Mark knows when you are scheduling these QBR's so that he can ensure the package is ready - some of these are coming up next week. Regards 
Rick, I hope you take the time to speak to Rodney Malcolm or Ray Bowen on how your technical and commercial exprience could help move the outsourcing product (in all its forms) forward in the industrial market. Otherwise, your welcome ... Regards Delainey 
Mike, if you Janet or Dave can cut the deal with Izzo go ahead and speak to him.  I don't think there is any practical way to enforce any percieved call we have on Izzo so you will have to determine how much Larry really wants the trubine or how he could benefit from striking a different deal. Regards Delainey 
Dave, In going through the turbine list over the last few days, EE&CC's, Sumas II- Goldendale (GE 7FA, Jun '01 delivery) turbine keeps popping up.  ENA could trade this turbine to several parties (Tenaska, Indeck) to get a lock on a QF restructuring.  Also, Sumas I still has restructruring value that EE&CC did not get a lock on in exchange for the EPC/turbine contract. As I recall, Larry Izzo promised to replace the GE 7FA turbine with a comparable machine with a Q4-2001 delivery date.  While the Goldendale EPC contract may executed and there may be nothing to do, there is significant value sitting on the table.  If we cannot get the Goldendale 7FA back, then can we enforce the replacement provision that was promised (as I remember) as part of your original deal with Larry Izzo?  I realize that at this point the politics may prevent us from doing anything.  However, I at least want to get you thinking about it just in case there was a way to get a turbine to trade for larger value than an EPC contract for EE&CC. Regards, Mike J. Miller 
Jim, I would forward to Chris Calger, Janet Dietrich and Jean Mrha. Thanks Delainey 
Dave -- Chris McGill  of AGA  called Margaret Carson and asked her  to speak to the gas distribution members of the  AGA  at their monthly meeting on  September 19th.    If you don't know her, Margaret works under me and provides research for Govt Affairs and business units throughout Enron. The  topic of the presentation is -- What  current  prices for natural gas mean for gas distributors and their strategies for asset management? Who, if anyone, would you like us to pass this along to?   Give me a call if you need more information. Thanks, Jim 
Laura, I spoke to Tom about his retail proposals, I told him that you would coordinate a meeting between Mark Muller/Lou Pai and himself.  I only want Lou going up if Tom is involved.  However, Mark Muller is up to go and I have spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today.  He is expecting your call. On a related note, I volunteered Wes Colwell (our controller and former Anderson person) to speak to Peoples accounting/ risk people and Anderson auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values inside Peoples.  I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting.  If Wes goes to Chicago, we want to ensure Leubbers, the Anderson folks and the appropriate Peoples accounting folks are available so Wes can spend the least amount of time on this issue. Jeff, where are we on the PECO/PSEG retail play that you spoke to Mark Muller about a couple weeks back? Mark, I forgot to mention that FPL is interested in potentially investing in the New Power Company - Tony Altman (President of FPL wholesale) would like to discuss.  If interested please call him at 561-625-7777.  If you don't think you will have any interest let me know and I will call him to let him know.  I probably need to get back to him either way shortly. Thanks. Regards

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is questionable.  I vote to kill it. Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with my partners.

Dave, Move on and I hope we don't pay more than Book when this is liquidated from the JEDI fund this fall.  Let me know when the asset is sold to a third party for a value greater than book. jeff David W Delainey@ECT 07/19/2000 09:34 PM 
Jeff, my team believes that there should be a premium to book in the range we quoted to you; however, I appreciate your interest.  I would agree that we have spent enough time on this and it is time to move on. Regards Delainey 
Dave,  I met with my team today and based on the data and information supplied by Steve, it is doubtful that the assets and on-going organization would command a current market value equivalent to book.  I am still willing to move the assets onto our balance sheet at book for the benefit of Enron, although if this was a third party bid, I would be surprised if we could pay this price.  Furthermore, due to your desire to maintain this discussion among the Houston teams only, I am assuming the PDP reserves are solid, no major enviornmental issues exit, legal problems are minimal and contracts are standard.  Let me know what you want to do. I think we have all spent enough time on this effort. On a side issue, are you aware that this is a JEDI I property?  My understanding is that Jedi I owns 100% of C-GAS and the Jedi I fund WILL be liquidated before the end of the year.  At what price will your unit pay to liquidate the fund? jeff David W Delainey@ECT 07/13/2000 08:12 PM 
Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation of approximately $39 M.  Please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your continued management. Let me know where you end up. Regards Delainey

Jordan, I assume the memo I asked for is in hard copy on my desk. Thanks Delainey 
CONFIDENTIAL Dave: A supplement to our memo to you regarding the Synfuel transaction...... Jordan 
CONFIDENTIAL Our memorandum of today's date on the DQE facilities estimates a 65% to 70% likelihood of the facilities qualifying for section 29 tax credits, based on projected volumes of 225 tons per hour. As we discussed a week ago, if we operate the facilities at a volume of 118 per hour, (i.e., half-capacity), we believe we would alleviate the tax risk associated with the increase in capacity.  The question is, does that improvement in the odds with respect to that one issue improve the bottom-line odds on qualification at least with respect to the base volume of 118 per hour from the 65% to 70% estimate that we specified in our memorandum? We think it does, but we are not sure that there will be a material improvement.  We have passed that question on to our outside tax counsel, and will let you know his view. As we noted last week, there are several legal issues for which, while we think we have the better argument, there is no definitive legal precedent. Even pulling the capacity issue out of the equation --which is what we would be doing if we are only considering the 118 tons -- there are still several other balls in the air, and we would have to catch each and every one in order to have a tax-creditworthy facility.  When you look at each issue, separately, it seems possible to get comfortable as to each one, but when you 
Guys, lets set up a meeting between the three of us on Monday ASAP to discuss.  I have a few ideas and I probably need to go have dinner with Lew to get him comfortable.  This may be setting up to be a larger asset management transaction.  Don can you try and find a time next week with Lew for me to have dinner - get Beverly to schedule the plane to get me in and out that day.  If not next week then early the following.  I think it will take a one on one with Lew to get this one centered. At our meeting, I would also like a status update on the other iniatives eg) Ameren, DPL, Cinergy, etc. The accounting issues on the generation projects need to be addressed as well. Regards Delainey 
Dave, As I mentioned in my voicemail last night, I spoke with Randy and Aldo.  The tone was positive, and they said Goldman was very bullish on the whole story.  All these guys acknowledge that without our Trading stamp on NewCo, NewCo will not be a world class Genco.  With that said, it is apparent that Lew is telling these guys to go back and get more EXACT detail on what exactly Enron is willing to do in terms of people (both Trading and Risk Management). I would have to believe that a conversation between you and Lew would go a long way in making him comfortable that we are truly committed to NewCo, particularly with $400-$500 million of equity tied up in this entity. Apparently we have to arm Lew with everything that he needs to go to Broadhead to argue why NewCo makes sense and why they need Enron in this entity.  I have tried to convince these guys that while Trading is people, it is also philosophy, style and approach.  Given that we have said that we would nominate the Head Trader, I have tried to convey that we might be looking to utilize a lot of FPLE T&M people, but immerse them in our philosophy.  They are not comfortable with this, and have informed me that coming back with the answer that we will only put one Enron person in Trading is probably not the right answer.  Given the dynamic nature of Enron and Trading in general,  making a huge commitment of people I would imagine will be tough. We talked through many other aspects including whether they think that they can do an IPO without us; the fact that having our involvement clearly increases the value of NewCo (raises an interesting question about how we get adequately compensated for this);  tight labor market in general and the fact that we don't have unlimited human resources here at Enron; and that in the early years, NewCo has very little merchant generation, and that all of it is FPLE 's (implies fewer people needed, and that we should be able to utilize FPLE Traders).  We also discussed the rumor about FPL's interest in Aquilla. Sorry to bog down your vacation with this.  If you want to talk today, I will be around.

Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.  The goal would be to have a definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could be acted upon. a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.; b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.; c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.; d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel ""header"" - Jean M.; e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.; f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al - Patrick   W. I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to determine a final action plan. Regards Delainey

Folks, Attached is a list of 37 executives, not yet enrolled on the ""exective impact and influence"" programme administered by Dick Amabile. The OTC clearly set the goal at the beginning of the year, and repeated again at Mid year, that all VPs and MDs need to have attended this programme by end of year 2000. Their attendance does form part of the discussions on the VPs and MDs at the executive PRC. Despite repeated comms from the OTC, these 37 names have not yet enrolled (or cancelled off a programme and have not re-enrolled). HR has committed to making sure that these people are enrolled, so the suggestion is that the named HR rep in the attachment takes 5 minutes to meet with the individuals, explain that they need to do this, show them the list of dates, and get them to choose which programme they want to enrol on. Please do not leave that meeting without a date! A word of caution, it is remotely possible that some of these individuals may have enrolled in the very recent past, or have attended and this data not yet reached Dick's spreadsheet, so do double check that they haven't yet enrolled before twisting their arms.. The dates for the remaining programmes are also on the spreadsheet. To enrol a VP or MD,  get their dates, give it to their assistants and tell them to directly contact Debbie Nowak on 33304. Tim 
Dave -- Update on activity related to California price caps.  Key issue is that we continue to believe a new vote will take place on Aug 1.  We continue to try and find additional ""no"" votes. Thanks, Jim 
Enron will take the initiative and help IEP jump-start the PR effort by the end of the week.  I spoke with Smutney this evening.  He likes the idea of Enron taking the lead with McNally/Temple.  I've emailed him the one-pager we worked up today.--Palmer, Steffes, Dasovich,Parquet The urgency for a solution is growing and a vaccuum has formed, with many trying to fill the void.  The Cal. Manufacturers Ass. has called a meeting with IEP and the utilities.  Dave Parquet and Doug Condon will attend. I spoke with the VP of Strategic Planning at the ISO today who said there is a ""98% chance"" that price caps will be on the agenda at the August ISO Board meeting. Dave Parquet continues to check with SDG&E to determine when SDG&E plans to make an announcement about what it intends to do with the offers it received last week. Dave Parquet is working with Andy Kellerman and J. Steffes to try and get the investment community energized on this issue. The issue is now apparently affecting California legislative races.  Staffers are drafting a bill that an ""at risk"" Democrat Senator from San Diego will carry, with the hope of using the bill to get the bump necessary to win the election.  Mona will meet with the staffer on Thursday to find out what he has in mind for the bill and to communicate our views. Dasovich will meet with Commissioner Bilas Wednesday to see if the Republican block of the California PUC is hanging tough. That's it from our end. Best, Jeff 
Don, go ahead and set it up - what have been discussing with them on the gas side? Did CSFB tell them about the $400 Kw capital cost plus the three year transistion agreement for $4.00 kw/m? Tell Beverly or Kay to make time for next week if Mr Forster can make it. Regards Delainey 
Dave, CSFB spoke with DPL today.  Pete Forster (chairman) said he wants to meet with you to discuss peakers and other opportunities on the trading and marketing side.  Besides 3200 MWs of Ohio regulated assets, DPL has a peaking strategy in ECAR and today has 400-500 MWs in development (interesting to have peaking strategy with no T&M).  They would like to look at our peakers to supplement strategy.  Forster didn't flinch when they said $400 kW is the ballpark number.  More interestingly, Forster went into his desire to talk with you about other ideas relating to T&M. Forster suggested 27th or 28th of July for the meeting.  You are more open on the 28th.  It appears Forster may be open to coming down here.  He wants CSFB and us to co-ordinate meeting schedule.  CSFB is DPL's main advisor, and the guys that negotiated the KKR deal a while back. Apparently we are talking with these guys on the gas side. Regards, Don

Janet, its your book - if you feel we have the LM's licked and we need the resources/the value at risk is minimal, I would go ahead. I would get Calger on side as well. Regards Delainey 
Dave, have you had a chance to give this much thought? 
As a matter of fact, this is on my list to discuss with you. I think we should pick up the 7EA's and maybe the 501D's as well (doubt we could pick and choose). I met with Mark Frevert yesterday afternoon to discuss the East Generation Strategy (along with Ben Jacoby and Don Miller) and he wanted me to talk with Larry Izzo about us taking all 4 turbines. Should I go ahead and have that discussion or would you like to discuss this in more detail first? The LM6000 position looks like this: 24 turbines allocated: 4 City of Austin 4 Enron South America 4 Las Vegas Cogen 6 Public Service of Colorado 6 Florida Merchant plant Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan are bringing their VEPCO/North Carolina deal to a point where we will probably need to make a decision in the next 2-3 weeks. It has a 4-year PPA and we are basically obligated to build a power plant to back-fill the position. The PPA will be able to be served from the market or plant, and we would need to use 4 of the 6 dual-fuel LM's currently allocated to Florida. There is a possibility we could go back to the 501D's but we'll have to see. The ecomomics of the deal leave Enron with about a 40-45% residual value on the plant at the end of 4 years, and Bruce Sukaly is in the process of showing this entire project to 4 counterparties in order to monetize the entire position. We still have 2-3 other customers looking at the LM's although they are moving fairly slow. I'd like to discuss our development strategy in a little more detail with you when you return but here are the highlights: Ben and his team will be looking to increase the sites we have under our control in several regions: PJM, ECAR, Georgia, and Florida to name a few. I think we may want to consider some configurations that include combined-cycle options that have a 5-year term (vs. our standard 2-year currently), primarily in Florida and maybe Georgia. Ben is putting this on paper along with the incremental resource needs and incremental developmental dollars needed. I think we should talk about increasing our site bank/development portfolio in Canada as well. Let me know your thoughts! Thanks. 
Good job Rodney - keep me up to speed and let me know where I can help. Regards Delainey 
Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not dropping the ball.

My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001. Key points for discussion will be: -brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America -brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report through wholesale -discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the retail business a success: -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those involved present on the call/meeting.

Dave, I am seeking your approval to take my group on an offsite to Las Vegas sometime in late 3rd/early 4th quarter. Cost is approx Cdn $1000/person for flight and accomodation (thursday - sunday). As you know, we have done this for a number of years but I'm not sure what approvals were obtained in the past as it was either your group or Lavorato's group at the time. This would involve Origination only as Trading is doing an offsite in conjunction with the rest of Shankman's group. It should be noted also that we decided not to attend the Masters this year as we didnt think it generated enough business following last years trip -  this cut our expenses substantially. Please let me know your thoughts on this. Regards Milnthorp

We are setting up the remainder as we speak.  I have some final comments on the packages you gave me; however, the color printing will not fax so we need to find time to discuss. Please fax the Friday ""package"" and the final Q2 numbers. Regards 
David, I wouldn't do the Brown Bag (too often- too hard to keep doing); I wouldn't do the Social Gathering (too country clubish); I like the Monthly Dinner/Cocktail Hour/Ballgame, etc with the OTC and parts of the management team as a forum to identify talent, give A&A's exposure to the management team and to ""sell"" ENA. I would suggest that we make it every two months rather than monthly. However, I would have the first one very quickly for the top rated A&A in ENA that are due to rotate soon in order to try and pitch them on staying in ENA - maybe dinner and ballgame. For the resource management and coaching part of the program, lets wait until we see where we end up on any possible changes to the program first.  I assume that you are working on a couple strawmen on possible alternatives. Once we have a few ideas, I would like to pitch Whalley, Sherriff and Mark when I get back. Lets go ahead and implement above ASAP. Regards Delainey 
Dave, I believe this is waht you asked for. Say the word and we will get cracking. David

FYI 
FYI =DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to build as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and give new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in the future. While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas - above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable future. The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased demand to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of available gas reserves in storage. Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric generation: from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants. Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts from the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to $2.81/MMBtu by 2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period. Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle gas plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. ""It's awfully hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do it 
Janet, we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very pleasant.  I think it is hightly unlikely that Larry will be coming up with an additional 7FA turbine - but you can call him.  I'm also starting to think as the LM position starts to get better managed that maybe you and Chris should take the D5's and 7EA's onto your book.  Something to think about, I am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without some resource availability.  I think you have to feel pretty good about the LM position first.  Something to think about? Regards Delainey 
Hey Dave, what's the real deal on the 7FA ""swap"" with Larry Izzo? Do they have the capability to give us another 7FA in 2001-2002? I listened to two voicemails from Cogentrix this am and they do seem to be serious about purchasing an incremental 1-2 7FA's if they can be delivered by winter 2002. I think their preference is to buy the turbine from us on the front end with no partnering in the project. There has been no serious negotiation on this to date and I don't want Scott to waste his time if we really don't have the turbine from EE&CC. Please advise. Thanks. 
How could coal fired QF's play into your and George's strategy? Regards Delainey 
Mike, this looks great - looking forward to seeing your final thoughts. Regards Delainey 
George, it is probably worth  speaking to them about the US assets - probably the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great brownfield sites. I'm not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired assets. I would speak to Sherriff on that one. However, I would caution that real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents. For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based on gas being on the margin.  Now that was before a lot of the run up so it may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys. As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a Wall Street point of view. We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia assets. Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's point of view.. Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view. Have we looked at this?  Are there many in the market? Regards Delainey 
Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation of approximately $39 M.  Please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your continued management. Let me know where you end up. Regards 
Jeff, I don't believe the offer I showed you of $39 M is unreasonable. In fact the team had recommended $42 M based on a number of measures.  I see the 6X multiple of annualized Q2 earnings as one of the best measures of the potential value of this company. I don't see it in the best interests of Enron to be transferring assets below a reasonable market value between business units.  You can trust that I will be keeping the Energy Capital Resources team's feet to the fire on the realization of this value if you do not purchase the company. If you and Steve can come up with a better indication of value, I will support that transaction. Regards Delainey 
Dave,  I have ask Steve Harper, Jack Harmuth, Howard Selzer,and  Glenn Fox to work with Steve Pruitt and see if the number you offered can be supported. The value for proved developed reserves and the financial/legal issues can be reviewed rather painlessly here in Houston.  The value for the  proved undeveloped reserves will most likely require a visit to the working team to see the program particulars, verify the acreage and , concluded the validity of this estimate of PUD value.  The idea of paying before tax NPV10% for an assumed 3.5 year program on top of the PD &PUD reserves will require a more indepth review. Obviously, we want to do this as simply as possible and I was prepared to take the package ""as is, where is"" at book value which I understood to be in the 30-32MM$ range including debt.  Dave I understand what you are doing and I would support this effort if we were selling the asset outside of the company.   I want to do what is best for Enron at this time which I believe is to transfer this asset to EGEP for the reasons i outlined in my prior memo.  It will benefit C-gas via direct access to technology and specialists, it will benefit EGEP for marketing and a US presence and it will benefit ENA by moving the asset from your books without a loss and releasing the valuable intellectual capital ENA could employ elsewhere in a higher yielding business venture.  However, with the premiums you have placed on the properties it is going to be very difficult to make this transaction happen.  (However, we are willing to try)  ENA has had this on the market for over a year with the intent to sell it at book if possible.  Prices have improved, but I believe even your team would admit this is still a project to get book in the market today.  Your estimated value at the current strip at a Before Tax 10% discount for Appalachian reserves seems a little aggressive for the market let alone an inter-company transfer. When we talked about this a couple of weeks ago we said it would be a fair transaction and at the time you were hedging that it would be around book.  I understood your logic for needing to talk with your team but I was relying on a fair deal to result.  Dave, I'm only sending this memo to you because I feel this is being pushed way past fair by your team with the intent that if we pay this it is a home run for your new team and since we are in a bind, let's see what happens.  I know this is a very small piece of business for you and the time it takes to read this is more than you can afford to this asset or transaction.  If fact,  the easy thing for you to do is get mad and say you don't have the time and stop the transaction.  On the other hand, if you believe the right thing for all parties is to do this at book, say so and you'll never deal with this piece of business again.  I hope in this case you will put the greater good of Enron in front of ENA's desire to hit a home run at EGEP's expense and in the spirit of ONE-ENRON move these assets to EGEP at book value. As I said in the beginning we will try to get to your number, but I am concerned that we will spend a lot of time and require effort from all of the teams that could be eliminated if you and I decided to make this transaction at book.  In fact, it would be the easiest transition for the C-Gas team which you've indicated to be a concern for your team.  I am available through voice mail and I can get my lotus notes most days.  Best thing is to leave a voice mail and a good time for me to call you back. Thanks Dave for your time, Jeff

ENA Mid-Year 2000 Senior Management and High Value Contributors Equity Awards Mary, As discussed yesterday, I have had further discussions with Dave and John on this subject and we would like to proceed as follows; - Wait for mid-year PRC discussions to conclude July 7 - Make recommendations for option grants to key first 6 month contributors and new management players following week - Strike equity and communicate to recipients Aug 1 The rationale for this would be as follows: - ENA has had a stellar first 6 months and will probably over exceed plan by $150mm - 5 or 6 individuals have been instrumental in creating exceptional value and we would like to recognise their performance now. - A number of people have over the last 6 months been asked to step up and take more senior roles following the moves to EBS and ENW. We would like to recognise these people now (subject to top 2 PRC performance) by granting them some options. - As a consequence of some people's increased responsibilities and in looking at their unvested equity value, a number of people appear low in relation to the market. I would anticipate that the individual awards would be of 7 year options with standard vesting and would mainly be of individual 5-10,000 options awards (or $145-$290k). These might total in the region of 150-250,000 options. While most of the probable recipients will be commercial officers, I would expect a number of senior support and some Commercial Directors also to be recommended. Obviously I understand that we will need to put individual cases together for each recipient for board submission but I would appreciate your help and guidance as we proceed. In particular please alert me asap if you think this will be a problem. Thanks David 
Guys, any interest? Regards Delainey 
David: I met with you last December/January in connection with working for Enron. At that time Enron made me an offer to work in your group.  I made the decision to not accept the offer.  The main reason was that I could not digest the concept of leaving BP Amoco less than six months after I had joined them. I am still with BP Amoco and they continue to treat me real well.  At the same time, I now realize that I made  a stupid mistake in turning down the Enron offer.  If you are willing to reconsider, I would love to talk to you. Considering what I put you through the last time, if you do not want to reconsider, I can understand. David, I would appreciate it I can meet with you in person to discuss this further with you.  If you are okay with it, can I buy you lunch and talk about this. Looking forward to hearing from you. Murali Viswanathan Ph. 281 363 2572 (h) 713 460 0641 (w)

FYI =DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to build as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and give new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in the future. While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas - above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable future. The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased demand to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of available gas reserves in storage. Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric generation: from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants. Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts from the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to $2.81/MMBtu by 2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period. Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle gas plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer.

Mike, I want to see the final costs before determining.  My understanding is that there is still significant expenses outstanding. Regards Delainey 
EE&CC has forwarded the peaker fee ($9.1 MM) invoice to ENA (see at bottom). I have sent a return e-mail to Gavin Gaul and John Normand explaining that final approval of this invoice will be from you.  Amy and I are waiting for a better breakdown of overhead charges on acceleration change orders.  Once we have the overhead issue framed out, I would then battle the fee, especially on Wilton Center, on a packaged basis with the overhead charges. As per the Wilton Center fee, I reviewed all of the e-mail rhetoric regarding who is to blame for the massive construction cost overruns.  EECC/NEPCO's cupbability lies in their insistance from day one that Wilton Center could and would be built non-union.  It was only after ENA forced the decision in late June 1999 to build the job union (to avoid air permit intervention) that EECC/NEPCO even began to deal with how to build the job in a union environment.  Even at that point, EECC/NEPCO would not move off of building the job on a cost reimbursable basis and did not properly consider other alternatives such as fixed unit pricing (fixed price per unit quantity installed).  EECC/NEPCO claimed that they did not have enough time to negotiate with the unionsor pursue other options.  However, because of their insistance to go non-union, they precluded the ability to negotiate until the decision to go union was made.  According to our labor experts, breaking off union site negotiations and building non-union is worse than just going non-union from the start.  In any event, if you need more detail on this subject prior to discussing the fee with Larry Izzo, please let me know and I will summarize the key points. I will continue to work with Amy Spoede to tie down the remaining cost and overhead issues.  If you need me to do anything else, please let me know. Regards, Mike Miller

Mary, I'm just curious why you need that info but it is 0 outside Enron comp plans. Regards 
Guys, there is quite a number of us dealing with this problem - what are our solutions? Could we have a corporate jet available for folks stuck in the A&A PRC? Other? Regards Delainey 
Jim, I agree - lets put a plan in place to ensure appropriate representation at these ISO's (not unlike PAC) and ensure that FERC is not abdicating their responsibilities. The three of us probably need to get together and discuss tactics around a number of issues. Jim, I am also curious where you are in your thoughts and plans given your new role. Regards Delainey 
Dave -- To your direct question of should Enron take a more active role in supporting or nominating Board members, I agree fully. I would add the following thoughts: First, I think that Enron's key position in terms of ISO / RTO governance should be that Boards (or the leadership and staff of transmission providers) should be indifferent to the price at which the commodity trades.  ISOs and RTOs should only worry about transmission, not the price of the commodity they are transmitting.   Winning on this issue will be critical as RTOs are proposed throughout the country to meet Order 2000 obligations. Also, Enron needs to really go after FERC for abdicating its wholesale market authority to ISOs, especially ISOs like in California that are dominated by state political figures.  FERC is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable rates, not some stakeholder Board established by state legislation.  We need to argue strongly that FERC must take back this authority in the near term and utilize its administrative procedures to impose any market changes. Finally, given that it will be some period of time before there is truly a ""financially indifferent"" transmission provider under Order 2000, Enron must take an active role in working within and through the Boards of the current ISOs.   A good example is the way that Dan Allegretti works within the NE-ISO.  These Boards and the ISOs are fundamentally political organizations.  Our representatives must take the time to get to know the people so that when key issues arise, we are able to influence the decisions. Thanks, Jim David W Delainey@ECT 06/29/2000 12:22 PM 
Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we managed the position in a very effective manner. Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors on these boards? Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti is putting plan in place. Regards Delainey

Ed, sounds like you have this handled - I would like to use your report as the example to use in other groups.  It can wait until you have it all completed.  You may want to think about EOL as well (ie) how many companies have you brought on-line, etc. summary: - coverage metrics; - market iniatives; - completed deals; - hot list; - EOL metrics.

Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we managed the position in a very effective manner. Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors on these boards? Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti is putting plan in place. Regards 
Nella, sorry to see you go; however, best of luck in all your future endeavours. Regards Delainey 
Don, in my opinion options 1 & 2 are the same and 3 is not an option.  I would like to provide an outsourcing deal that earns us fees and provides information.  We will manage the internal issues.  A properly priced and scoped term outsourcing deal should be doable.  Please speak with Sally Beck and Beth Perleman. Regards Delainey 
Dave, We had a good meeting with Presto today.  We came away with a broad T&M outline.  One concern that Kevin raised is our ability to actually do a ""services agreement"" for the risk management and back offices aspect of NewCo.  Apparently, he said a number of issues have bubbled up recently with our systems in terms of manpower, age of system, and ability to take on additional load.  He said throwing on an incremental 4000-5000 MWs with NewCo may prove to be too much to handle.  He also raised the ""confidentiality issue"".  It is his view that NewCo should have this capability in-house anyway (obviously that was always the long term intent, with this services agreement more a bridge). Several options exist. 1.  Force a 12-24 month services agreement through the system (solve our problems with more people, etc). 2.  Agree to set up NewCo's system using our unique expertise and experience. We would do this for a fee (say $15MM?).   One issue here is just NewCo's ability to get this done in conjunction with everything else in time to do IPO. 3. Investigate what type of system FPLe is using today.  Since we are not increasing net merchant MWs on day 1, FPLe's system could serve as the platform for future MW expansion.  Maybe Enron comes in and expands/redesigns system for a fee?  I believe that FPLe has just recently expanded/updated their system.  I would like to try to learn more about their system. Let me know if you have a preference or any additional thoughts.  I think we can make money off of all three options. Thanks, Don

Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the aborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months ago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention significant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the $600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve growth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable strategy to maximize the exit value). I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points: a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention. Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to sell tha asset. I hope this meets with your approval. Regards Delainey

We spent three days meeting with the FPL guys last week.  The meetings were productive, and we are making progress.  Lew has instructed these guys to get down into a lot of detail on the business plan/core competencies, which we did! They also floated the valuation of their existing assets - $3.1B for 3947 MWs or $789/kW.  We walked them through our peaker valuation as well.  We didn't debate the valuations, but rather we decided to go ahead and have Clement and Jinsung try to pull together a consolidated model for NewCo.  That is being done, and should be ready Monday/Tuesday. It is apparent from these meetings that they are looking for ENRON to provide several key pieces to NewCo (other than peakers and dev. projects): 1. Enron culture and emphasis on intellectual capital (including HR approach). 2. Trading and marketing expertise. 3. Enron style finance. 4. Select management spots. 5. Supplement development team. The interesting debate is how we get compensated for the significant impact that the Enron ""halo"" is going to have on NewCo's IPO ( particularly if we deliver the items listed above).  I raised this incremental value issue with them. FPL's key pieces include: 1. Core ""operating"" competencies and asset management techniques. 2. Construction management techniques. 3.  Select management spots. 4.  National development team. The FPL risk in this whole exercise is if Lew is unsuccessful in convincing Broadhead that owning some % of NewCo is not a better value proposition that owning 100% on FPLE; and/or the decision to wait until Florida deregulates before spinning out FPLE.  Glenn Smith stopped by last week and he highlighted these issues as well. We have a lot of work to do this week including a need to determine Trading & Marketing model; develop potential services agreements (QF, back office); refine our financial model and expand to include new projects, turbine capx, etc.; expand development framework;  pull pitch together to float NewCo by investment bank, etc..... I am happy to expand on exactly where we stand with FPL.  I guess we also need to think about staffing if both Cinergy and FPL move forward (let's just sell the peakers to Cinergy for $1.25B and let them do their own IPO). Regards, Don Sent by: Kay Chapman

Regards Delainey 
Dave: I really hate to bother you with this, but anything you can do to get these guys off the dime and moving (rather than complaining) would be appreciated. I called Westfahl as you suggested, but he never responded. At the end of the day, I think maybe the board approval we were talking about (Moore, Florida and Louisiana) is the only way to send the message. One highlight of interest in Coleman's e-mail is that it takes longer than 7 months to construct a 6 - LM6000 plant. That's pretty amazing given that NEPCO just finished constructing four ENA plants (Gleason, Wheatland, Wilton and Doyle) in less than 6 months. Anything you can do (or any advice) would be appreciated. Right now I'm simply ignoring the negativism and proceeding as quickly as possible. Regards, Ben 
Ben, Reflecting on our conversation at lunch the other day, I want to re-emphasize my concerns about the schedule issues.  You indicated that you had an idea that the plant could be built in the field in 120 days, or approximately 4 months.  This is not at all realistic.  I would expect that the most aggressive schedule for a greenfield installation of simple cycle gas fired LM 6000's would run approximately 90 days for the first unit, plus about two weeks for each additional unit.  This would result in an installation duration of aproximately 5.5 months for a 6 unit gas fired plant.  In front of that there would have to be site preparation and initial foundation work done. The Florida and Louisiana projects can be expected to have significant piling requirements which will add probably a minimum of 30 days to the front of this schedule, and the dual fuel consideration may lengthen the incremental installation time per unit somewhat.  Considering these factors, it would not be unreasonable to expect field duration to be 7 months or longer. I know that this is much longer than what you have had in mind.  But I think that this is real world.  For a 1 June start of operations, this would mean getting site access by 1 November, which is only 4 months from now. You stated that the permitting requirements may be as much as 6 months for Florida.  If this is correct then there is a serious disconnect for your schedule.  We need to make all efforts to expedite the on site date if June 01 commercial operations is to be achieved. Let's talk. Mike

Rob, makes sense. How does this change our view on Moore? egards Delainey 
Dave, I didnt get a chance to talk to you during your meeting but thought I should make you aware of the following. Unfortunately, we have experienced a bit of a set-back re Ontario market opening. As you know, the market was scheduled to open November 1,2000. We had anticipated somewhat of a delay and had forecasted a Feb 1, 2001 start. This week the Minister of Energy announced that market opening would be delayed ""about 6 months"". This of course is very dissppointing to us and Aleck Dadson is working hard with the Ministry and other interested parties in shoring up a date with a tighter time frame. The reason for the delay is primarily due to the lack of readiness on behalf of the IMO. This is a frustrating situation for the minister and as such he has moved to appoint myself to the IMO Board. It should be noted that the Minister did not accept the IMO's board recommendation but unilaterally went with me. He was intent on appointing someone who had goal alignment re opening this market asap. This goes a long way in illustrating the great job our regulatory group (Aleck Dadson) has done/is doing  in positioning/developing credibility with the Ministry of Energy. I know that you had concerns re time commitment but I believe strongly that Enron needs a voice at the IMO Board as this is a critical point in time to shape this marketplace. Regards Milnthorp

Guys, I will forward the info as it becomes available.  There appears to be one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the development road.  If interested in these projects, which have to meet a December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA.

Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville and Ondarza).  As you are aware, I sued them for breach.  The settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.  It is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.  It seemed logical to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability. Lets discuss. Regards Delainey

How about Chuck Dana at Owens Corning, Steve Messinger at GC/BICC, as well... In addition, metering customer references thru Jeff Messina should prevent customer burn out Dan Kurt Wangenheim 06/15/2000 10:08 PM 
ENA has asked for EES customer references.  ENA is currently working with National Gypsum and National Gypsum has asked for two references. They would prefer manufacturers that have over 10% of their cost of goods sold as energy and have DSM projects completed at their facilities.  ENA has solicited my support in getting these references because when they asked EES Sales, they found them not to be overly cooperative with supplying names out of fear that ENA may burn out EES customers before EES Sales can use them. Since EES customers fall under Jeff's pervue, I need your help in getting the go-ahead to approach the account managers to set this up.  My suggestions would be World Color Press, Package Ice, Polaroid, or Ocean Spray.  Suiza would be a good choice if we could get the right person. ENA has asked me to get this information to them as soon as possible since the deal is on hold until they get the references. Thanks, Kurt 
I believe this has been handled appropriately; however, FYI. Regards Delainey

Ray, I am ok with Nick and his group managing if Redmond/Mrha are ok.  Like Rebox, whoever is technically responsible is highly accountable to ensure that reporting and procedures are correctly followed and that the project comes in on time, budget and technically works.   In this capacity, I would like that engineer to report to you or Wayne Mays. Regards Delainey 
Scott, I would like to re-emphasize our commitment to you and your team in ensuring this project is successful.  As we had discussed we are very eager to provide Project Management services for the Millenia project.  In fact Audrey and I am visiting BCCK this Friday to be sure we are not leaving anything else on the table which Enron could capture.  We in fact have identified one of our PMs, who has over 20 years experience in the industry, to lead the project. He will be augmented by Audrey who is not only a terrific process engineer but is managing the Lost Creek process plant/compressor station intallation in Wyoming. My team is also managing the implementation of the Fort Union Gas Gathering project in Wyoming. I understand things are heating up and all of us are looking forward to you kicking off the project.  Please feel free to call me at x58273. Nick 
Nick- Per our conversation, Ward Polzin from the Producer Finance Group mentioned that during their presentation to Dave Delaney with Ray Bowen-VP Commercial and Scott Josey, the subject of who would do the project management for Enron came up.  Ward said my name was mentioned and that Ray Bowen said that if I couldn't he knew of a group from Power that did Project Management. I would highly recommend you step in quickly offering our services before the decision is made to use someone else. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks, Audrey

Rich Cassano, an ENA Associate candidate with an outstanding offer, has asked if Enron would pay for he and his wife to visit Houston for prior to his making a decision to joining Enron. This candidate is from New York and has only been to Houston for the Super Saturday weekend.

Guys, the project should be charged market based rates and ENA is not in the business of subsidizing international projects.  This is particularily the case if we are not going to hold a continued interest in the project. However, if we can not reach a term O&M agreement please maintain the optionality in the project by managing the facility on a direct bill basis to APACHI until they find an alternative provider. Do not in any event abandon any assets at any time. Regards Delainey 
A couple of points: 1) Dobler says that he has been in Nigeria for six months with no compensation and very poor communication. 2) The scope has changed from 3 barges to 9 barge. 3) His price quote is cost reimbursement plus $750,000/year for approximately thirteen years.  PV is between $5 and $6 million. 4) APACHI is having a severe case of sticker shock. 5) He insists this is market for a major international provider. I need to understand your view as to whether we should price at market or does OEC have the mandate to be a ""support"" function for other Enron businesses (I assume the answer is NO) Ray 
Dave: It is apparent that we are not going to reach agreement on an O&M contract that will be acceptable to third parties.  Given our clear intention to exit this project as fast as possible and extract our value through a promote, this leaves me no choice but to seek other alternatives.  I would appreciate your providing me interim O&M services until I can identify a third party service provider.  If you carry out your threat to abandon the assets, this will result in invalidation of our insurance coverage.  I hope you understand that this is not in anyone's interest.  I am disappointed to discover that our first experience with the new structure of O&M services is so unsatisfactory. Jim Hughes 
I think Jean is gong to be there - thats ok. Regards Delainey

Jeff, I would like to discuss this with you and your plans in gas. Regards Delainey 
Tim, in the east power group and the gas groups, we are trying to build a mid-market capability(deal flow, information and coverage) consistent with the largest energy merchant in N.A.. Please see tha attached.  I would be curious to talk to you about your structure, coverage functions and market building iniatives. I recognize that you and your group have been the most effective and proactive group in these areas for some time.  Is there areas where we could be more aggressive or proactive?  Can I get you more resources to cover the market more aggresively? Lets discuss. Regards Delainey 
Ed, this looks great!!!! Please ensure that the focus is on coverage, deal flow and building markets. I want to avoid two groups hunting strategic elephants (ie) east origination and development so ensure the scope is consistent with mid-market coverage and feeding the desk deals and info.   In the case of building or purchasing assets please let Jacoby's group handle.  Any deal or lead that significantly disrupts coverage or takes you or your people out of the market please pass or coordinate with origination or development There is bound to be some conflict between the strategic origination groups and you - please keep to a minimum and resolve in a manner consistent with one team and doing the right thing. Please provide John and I a monthly report of customer transactions completed, coverage plans and ""market building iniatives"". Let me know how I can assist in any way in recruiting or transactions. Regards Delainey 
Please forward to ""Expense Report"" upon approval.  Thanks, Darlene 
What about Barry and Eric? This looks good. regards Delainey

Don, with regard to your previous message please contact Michael. Regards Delainey 
I am contacting you to confirm our meeting with you and some of your colleagues next Wed. June 14th, 3-4PM.  Attending on Enron Wind's behalf will be Kurt Huneke and Adam Umanoff (MD, Commercial Americas) In the last two months Enron completed the acquisition of the minority shares (~20%) in Enron Wind Corp.   As a result of this decision, Enron has also made a variety of changes in Enron Wind as a first step to maximizing our return in this industry. One of the very next steps we are taking is an effort to reacquaint the various operating subsidiaries with Enron Wind.  As the regulatory environment evolves in North America a number of new opportunities are evolving which should benefit ENA as a result of Enron's market position. We thought it might be useful if John Lavorato, Janet Dietrich and Kevin Presto were available to join us as well.  Please feel free to invite anyone else you feel would be appropriate.  As you may know, we have begun to discuss some of these opportunities with EPMI and we are encouraged by the way we see the market developing. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this meeting. Thank you, Michael Payne Director Enron Wind 6-9690

Ben, don't do anything at this point.  It is not needed. Regards Delainey 
Dave: I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and very early in discussions that a ""CA"" at this time was not needed.  There were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no ""CA"".  Let me know if this is your thoughts as well.  Thanks! Ben 
Guys, I suggest that we write it down in order to ensure that we don't get it back as other groups use up the Raptor capacity. We have sufficient market data points to do this.  Please advise. Regards Delainey 
Catalytica filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC yesterday, December 11th which disclosed that because of recent market conditions the Board had decided not to proceed with the planned stock split prior to the spin-off. The supplement indicates an expected initial trading range ""at a price between $20 and no less than $10 per share"".   Based upon these new Catalytica's estimates, the value of the Enron investment would be $13.5 to $27.0 million.  Enron's Catalytica investment is part of the raptor structure so that the impact is on raptor capacity rather than earnings.  The investment has also been monetized in a FAS 125 structure for cash flow purposes.

Dave, Some time back you should have received a voicemail from Paula Rieker regarding my seeking a meeting with you.  I was located in India at the time, and project Summer was on at the time.  Hence, after a couple of initial attempts, I decided to wait a while before I sought a meeting with you. However, now with Project Summer behind us, I would like to meet with you to discuss potential opportunities in the North America Region.  I was part of the Associate pool at ECT, and have worked with Jim Fallon and Paula Rieker, among others.  I had then taken an assignment to work in India, and have been there for some years now. I am in Houston for the rest of the week and will be seeking to get on your calender for a brief chat on opportunities in your group. Regards, Sandeep. 
Guys, we are working to put together the final team to manage this issue; however, it isJeff Skilling's call to keep Delainey, Milnthorp and Keohane out of the day to day fray on this issue.  I believe this is the right call. Commercial and legal resources from Houston will manage this issue on a go forward basis and may call on you as a resource if needed from time to time. You have done a very great job managing this issue to date and your efforts on that front are much appreciated.  Our focus should return to growing the business and meeting our financial targets. Peter, I believe that Mark H. would like you to stay involved through the Friday conference call that is scheduled. Regards 
Mark, you have this one! Regards Delainey 
I just heard that Chris Gaffney is transferring to the Toronto office. His skill sets/capabilities have been critical in the closing of both the UI and NSTAR deals and he has been actively engaged in the long-term NSTAR deal, Con-Ed, and our Project Green Jacket. It is critical to our business to have no transitional period with attorneys and I expect his replacement to be fully up to speed (i.e. knowledge of the power market, understanding of structured power transactions, etc) relative to definitive documents around these transactions. Chris is definitely a loss to our team. Please advise as to his qualified replacement on these specific deals.  Thanks. 
Don, lets hang tough for a day or two.  Nothing needed for Cinergy. Regards

Mike, why would it cost $450 to $470/kw for the Moore project?  It is a 4 unit ABB configuration and the turbine costs appear to be in line with Wilton 7EA's on a kw basis. 
Dave, the impression we are getting is that Houston thinks this deal is dead or on the back burner. Until you tell me otherwise, we are going full steam ahead. Is there any way that you can help us get the airtime we need down south? We are now down to crunch time, and I dont want to see this project slip away due to control groups dragging their feet. Regards Milnthorp 
Rob,this deal is not dead; I am primarly waiting on NEPCO numbers. You should be moving down the road on the deconstruction, refurbishment and movement of the NB machines.   You should also be doing any development work (permits, interconnection agreements et al) you need to do to maintain the optionality of this project (let me know if the expenses get above $1MM). Randy, please facilitate. Mike, can we put the screws to ABB given the significant transformer business we forwarded their way? Laura, we probably need to make a call on the Peoples turbine pretty soon. Eric/Rob, I think we need to see the project with IDC come in  between 350 to 400/kw to be viable or I need a very detailed analysis of why it costs significantly more than a Frame 7 machine in the US markets. I would like see us make this work. Regards Delainey

Attached is the Vitro Project Summary. 
Eric, I am on the road - I really don't have much to say. We have had very little interaction. Regards 
Good job - Randy. Live to fight another day - I don't know if you know but I settled with Fort James - we ripped up all three contracts for no money that netted us approximately $15M in value through the elimination of the two power contracts in the NW.  Wertz was on the other side.  Thought you might want to know. Thanks 
Jeff, can you spend a little time thinking about the current North American energy markets (very high energy prices, stretched infrastructure, etc) and determine which game changing or altering technologies, business models or existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility levels. In particular, I think that Miller should take a look at coal gasification technologies, emissions technologies and DSM/efficiency technologies and how these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business.  As well, from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie) IPP, E&P, utility, assets, etc are undervalued given current commodity curves and expectations. Can you get back to me with a few ideas in the next week or so - maybe it would help to go pick a few brains in various ENA orgs as part of your process. Regards 
This is great Rob! Regards 
Rodney, please give Cliff a call.  I spoke with him today.  He will handle. Please fill him in on your discussions to date. Thanks Delainey 
Eric, we need more than $2M saving to get this deal to clear the hurdle.  I think we need to get to $350 to $400/kw firm including IDC to make this viable.  Please ensure that NEPCO is working to figure out the disconnect. Regards 
Dick , I appreciate the effort on the Moore project - I would hope that there is more than a $2m saving in the scope.  This plant is still showing $460 to $470/Kw given current economics.  I am still puzzled by this. Regards Delainey 
John, great job! Please, work with Jeff to move the longer term deal along. Regards Delainey 
Guys, I will set up a monthly meeting between myself and you guys to discuss deal flow, priorities and strategy - I think you will find that more effective and I can keep the other meeting small. Kay, please set up. Regards Delainey 
Dave -- Effective May 19, I have replaced Elisabeth McCabe as head of ENA's Public Relations department.  With the recent reconfiguration of the ENA staff meeting, public relations has not been included.  I believe it is important to be in attendance at the weekly staff meetings, so public relations can stay abreast of the various deals/projects and be prepared to handle the public relations surrounding them. I would like to request that I be added to the list of regular attendees. Additionally, I believe it would be helpful for Kathryn Corbally from Corporate Investor Relations to be in attendance as well.  She attended the meetings in the past and should be included for the same reasons.  If you would like to discuss this issue, please call me at ext. 3-9053. Thanks. Eric Thode 
Ben,  why are we distributing this? It is inaccurate and I'm not sure I want it floating around the place. Regards Delainey 
Celeste, try and get him scheduled into the Super Saturday if possible so that the risk guys can take a look at him.  If that can't be done then give me a call. Regards 
Rob, I think we should renew the flame for the three year period.  My understanding is that it is $75 K Cdn per year roughly.  Not paid up-front and cancellable if Flames leave Calgary or disappear.  Expense in Canada.  It is your call ultimately. Regards 
Dave, I am going to send Shawn your way - he has extensive development, asset and project finance experience.  I would like him under your supervision to manage our coal power development strategy - like we discussed it could be a very robust strategy with multiple exit points.  I strongly believe that coal needs to come back into the stack and that the existing development teams (Parquet & Jacoby) are already buried under mid-stream gas development opportunities. This would incorporate acquisitions, development, technology,  asset sales, emissions credits & technology, fuel supply and power sales. Please update your 2001 budget to incorporate this new iniative. Regards Delainey 
Dave: Thanks for your time and patience today. For now, I'll park the theoretical and focus on the practical.  (we can pick up the other topics later over beers sometime) I completely agree that the US coal-genco business can offer a huge near-term win for those that move swiftly. Thanks for offering me the shot to capitalize on it. Shawn 
Janet, I though we signed a turnkey with NEPCO - there should not be any overruns to your P&L if that is the case. Regards Delainey 
Dave, since the ENA power desk will be receiving 100% of all earnings related to the City of Austin capacity, it's only appropriate that any cost overruns will be sent directly to their P/L. There isn't anything that leads me to believe there will be overruns, but you know how that goes with NEPCO and I want to be very clear up front that if something should occur, I have no ability to offset the cost with other Austin earnings. I'd also like to set aside some time when we can talk thru several business items/issues. The teaser list is as follows:  continuing internal noise between the desks and origination groups related to deals and primarily the P/L split (any maybe a few solutions), the followup and status and recommendations on the global LNG business and ENA's interest (I've had meetings with Doug Rotenburg, Vince Kiminski, others, and new info from our Duke meeting), status of Chicago office, clarification on leftover items from Columbia acquisition last year, employee hiring/contracts,  etc. Maybe we can get together this afternoon or tomorrow. How about the status of the FP&L meeting with Jim Broadhead? 
Hey guys. I would like an outline of the City of Austin project as far as how this will be managed from ENA's standpoint. My understanding is that Jeff Keenan will be the Project Manager for ENA and will be entirely responsible for the implementation of all aspects to bring the plant to commercial operations. This would include schedule, permitting, interconnect agreements, managing NEPCO to the $88.3 million total cost, etc. Everyone needs to realize that this team will realize a true loss on any overruns above the $88.3 million. I've asked Tammy Shepherd to set up a budget, schedule and weekly distribution similarly to how we handled Doyle and the other projects. I'm assuming that this team is managing everything related to the Austin project and is accountable for its successful implementation. If we need to discuss anything related to the above, let me know.  Thanks.

During our off-site at Columbia Lakes recently,  we identified areas in ENA where significant gaps exist that need filling at the Analyst and Associate level.  We have scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday on June 3, 2000 and I would like your participation as an interviewer.  We will need approximately 25-30 interviewers to fill approximately 30 Associate & Analyst positions.

Guys, Wes is going to come talk to you about booking more value in Mariner in order to meet Global Finance and ENA targets.  I want a view from you guys of what is the prudent carry value for Mariner assuming current gas prices and the reserve increases assumed to coming.  Keep in mind what would be a reasonble sale value for the asset mid-next year as per our plan. Regards 
Kevin, I would like more detail on these issues of which I was not aware - lets discuss next week. Regards Delainey 
Any ideas?  These guys (John & Jere) just can't get it together. Regards Delainey 
Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern (especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.  You guys could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John at the offsite): a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination if this is a commercially viable product; b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote this capability to these customers ASAP; c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP; d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups. This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis. Regards Delainey 
We are heading down the road of a gate keeper approach which has proven very inefficient at Enron in the past.    Our group has already canceled a meeting with the CFO of Vintage because of this approach.  Rerarding  industry relationships, George Carrick, Mark Tawney and I have extensive relationships throughout the upstream sector, know the decision makers and can set up our own meetings, all in coordination with the upstream group.  At this time I am waiting on John's group to set up our meetings.  Seems very inefficient. The main objective is to determine if there is demand for the product.  I will continue to coordinate through John but we need to meet to clarify roles and responsibilities of all parties - how will deals be structured, who will price, who will negotiate transaction, etc.

Guys, Swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market group in east power and make a difference.  I would strongly support his movement into either SERC or ECAR as per our earlier discussion. I hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in those markets.  I would also hope to move a reasonable number of new associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various desks.  The goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and mid-market groups plus support John's iniatives on the fundamental groups. Regards

Larry and Joe, Is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on Westinghouse to get the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the Gleason 501FD issues and the vibration issues at Wheatland?  The phone call by Larry to GE has made a world of difference. Regards Delainey 
Mark, We have been working diligently with Westinghouse to get a schedule for the removal and modification of the blade rings at Gleason.  I requested Westinghouse begin to prepare for this work on Sunday after you confirmed that we could no longer tolerate the operating restriction being added to the unit.  Based on discussions with Westinghouse on Sunday, we estimated that the work could be completed in 14 days.  The site began disassembly of unit #2 on Monday.  Unit #1 disassembly began on Tuesday because we had to wait for the unit to cool down. The first verbal schedule from Westinghouse was received Monday night.  It showed the blade rings being machined in series at a single shop and resulted in the lasy unit being delayed about 4 days.  I told Westinghouse this would not be acceptable and that the blade rings needed to be machined in parallel.  Westinghouse agreed and has made a second shop available.  Another schedule was published yesterday afternoon that required an additional step in the disassembly that I felt was not required and added a day to the duration.  Westinghouse suggested that we remove the compressor blades from the rotor before we remove the blade rings.  I have since concluded that removing the rotor blades first is in fact the correct procedure. As we discussed at the meeting this morning, this schedule for the blade rings, which has been at the site since last night,  will be distributed to everyone today.  In addition, the site will incorporate the remaining startup activities and issue an integrated schedule tonight. As we discussed at the meeting this morning, it is very unlikely that Gleason #1 and #2 can be available by June 1.  Our optimistic estimate from the meeting this morning was June 4-7. Gavin 
John/Gavin - We have made progress over the last week in getting GE attention focused on the emissions problems at Lincoln.  After 6 days of daily conferences on the subject, GE has arrived in force at Lincoln, with the personnel and resources required to address the problem.  We are not out of the woods yet, but I believe everything is now being done that can be done to get as many machines available as possible by June 1. Enron needs the same focus from Westinghouse, on  issues currently plagueing Wheatland and Gleason.  Unlike Lincoln, where the machines are capable of producing MW's, these two sites have units that cannot operate.  Namely, vibration issues on units 1 and 2 at Wheatland and compressor blade ring issues on units 1 and 2 at Gleason. ENA has been requesting since Monday this week, a definitve and complete schedule from EECC, showing the disassembly, shipping, machining, reassembly and testing of units 1 and 2 blade rings at Gleason.  We still do not have this schedule.  Furthermore, it would appear that after this morning's meeting, there is some confusion on what work actually needs to be performed in order to accomplish this task and what impact that may have on the 14-day schedule committed to ENA by Gavin Gaul on 5/15.  I am not sure whether the communication breakdown is between business units at Westinghouse or between Enron and Westinghouse, but a schedule and plan is the first step towards getting the work done and we are two days into the work.  I am expecting this plan to be circulated today. Lastly, although we have been verbally assured by Westinghouse that there will be no operating restrictions, other than routine borescope inspections during off-peak periods, OEC would be more comfortable getting this in writing.  We are requesting a formal notice from Westinghouse, identifying any operational restrictions (post-blade ring repair) on these units. If there is any assistance you require, please do not hesitate to request it.  We collectively have 14 days to declare all 15 units ready for commercial operation. MSD

This looks good Mike - I appreciate the efforts. Regard 
Looks rather impressive. Good job. Regards 
Jere, please forward the list of targets. Let me speak initially with John - lets try and get this done today.  I appreciate the effort on the peakers. As well, I would suggest we start discussions with  Reeding & Bates which according to both Redmond and Thompson is a live deal. Thanks Delainey 
I was out of town last week on vacation.  The peaker project is moving ahead.  George Carrick and John met last week regarding upstream activities. No final resolution. I have a voice mail in to John and will get things worked out this week.  The most important issue is to get into market place and test product with another transaction. Jere 
Ken, in response to the letter from Mr Miguel San Juan, my suggestion would be to offer up the Falcon for their use; however, given the tight time frame and your recent visit with Mr. Fox that it would be difficult for either you or me to participate. I spoke to Max and he agrees with this approach. I hope this meets with your approval. Regards 
Thxs Joe -much appreciated. Dave 
Done, Larry and his team fully understands the importance. They are working on tuning the machines. Hopefully not more thana couple of days. Joe David W Delainey@ECT 05/15/2000 05:50 PM 
Joe, I would appreciate a quick call by you to Larry to ensure that his organization is focused to get these plants over the goal line ASAP.  We still have technical issues with the vendor that need to be addressed.  I believe EE&CC is working the issues; however, a phone call from you to emphasize the importance to Enron will add extra encouragement. Thanks. Regards Delainey 
Guys, I understand that none of the facilities were available today - I thought we were targeting 750 MW.  What is the updated availability schedule for each unit?  We are only a couple of weeks from June 1.  Please advise. Regards Delainey 
Rob, does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase?   If it is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community and it should continue to sponsor the flame.  On the accounting front, expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and budgeted next. Let discuss Regards Delainey 
Dave, any thoughts re continued sponsorship/advertising for the Calgary Flames.? 
Rob, further to our conversation. I have had attached a couple of the notes recently sent to the PR group.  Historically, the expense for this advertising has been paid by the Houston. The overall expense item was not that large and Corp was paying because generally they were not supporting any other expense in Calgary and deemed this request reasonable.  If possible I would ask that you secure approval from Delainey with regards to the renewal of this item. Needless to say, this Flame has been a flagship for Enron in the Hockey community and our association with the Flames ownership committee does not go unnoticed ! Please let me know if you need anything but our basic request is corporate approval to reimburse canada for the next 3 years @ approx. $ 50,000.00 US/year. Thanks in advance, Barry 
Barry -- While PR can approve the look and feel of the sign, the cost would have to be approved by ENA Chairman's office.  Generally, it has been my understanding that each commercial group pays for such marketing expenses from its own budget.  As I am no longer working in the PR group, it would be best if you contact the Chairman's office directly to present the business case and request expense approval. Kal Shah x 39354 Barry Tycholiz 05/02/2000 01:13 PM 
Kal,  further to my previous e-mail. This note is to advise as to the final costs that will be associated with the renewal of the Enron sponsorship. We have negotiated a 3 year deal with the Calgary Flames.  Can you please verify via e-mail that ECC will be reimbursed by ENA for this annual advertising expense.  Upon receipt of the invoice, we will process payment and coordinate this on your behalf. Nov 2000 - Nov 2001        $68,000 + 7 % Tax = $72,760. / $ 1.47 ( Currency ).  Approx. $ 50,000.00 US/Year advertising expense. Invoicing for this up coming season will be in the next couple of months.  I will also coordinate the execution of all documents regarding legal liability, renewal rights etc. Thanks in advance. Barry 
Barry, I've forwarded your e-mail to Kal Shah.  He handles marketing for ENA.  He will be in touch. marge 
Guys, I appreciate the updates. Please ensure 1) that you, as ENA, are integrated 2) deliver a very clear expectation with EE&CC with a credible plan and 3) that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed.  You will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we get over the goal line. Keep me in the loop daily so that I can keep the pressure on at a senior level. Regards 
Guys, have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 501FD's at Gleason?  Will they be machining the equipment on site - it appears to me that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible.  Do we have a credible site rep from Westinghouse for both Wheatland and Gleason? Please advise. Thanks Delainey

Scott, you need to make your own call on that one - I think you could add value in either. Regards 
Mark, FYI - In my estimation this business is no bigger than Mexico or the Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.  I see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.  I also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and not loose any capability.  Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH by at least a third to one-half.  Did you or Jeff speak with Jim? Regards Delainey 
Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken. I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the first world is out this week.  I ask for your patience. Lets discuss. Regards Delainey 
Draft memo on the functional alignment of South America under the new organization.

Look at the first version of the memo.  Please reply with any comments asap. 
Chris, when did BP Amoco get involved?  I thought we were dealing with Avista. Regards Delainey 
Dave, Update from Friday Afternoon: Coyote:  Avista Board approved a 50% equity investment in Coyote Springs II and publicly announced their intention to move forward.  Their equity partner, BP Amoco, indicated that they need 30 more days to ""get comfortable with the market"".  This thirty day period coincides with the expected financial close of June 15 so it may just be posturing to let us know that they are not committed until the deal actually closes.  Nevertheless, we (Avista and Enron) will pursue fallback investors that have already seen the project and previously expressed interest in a 50% share.  In parallel, we will try to get BP Amoco ""comfortable"".  It might make sense to consider someone else that can move quickly.  Deal probability drops from 80% to 50%. LVCogen:  Vickers and Gilbert met with Sierra Pacific and confirmed their interest in and ability to effect a restructuring of the PPA.  Although timing of ""securitization"" is open-ended, Sierra has agreed to a contract valuation that supports a valuation uplift of $10MM - $14MM.  If we assume a 40%-50% probability of restructuring, we get to the hotlisted $5MM gain for QII.   Attached is a spreadsheet that shows the breakup value of LVCogen. CTG and Power Structuring are finalizing the RAC models that support this approach. Regards, Chris 
Scott, what is our emissions strategy for these counterparties? Regards Delainey

Maybe that commercial is closer than to the truth than I thought ...... Regards Delainey 
Sounds good - I think you have a great opportunity in this market - I would suggest staffing aggressively in order to take the first mover advantage.  I note the associate needs. Regards Delainey 
Dave, I missed one point regarding the Toronto trader. Lavorato and Belden have identified an associate and he's interested in coming to Toronto. He is in Toronto today meeting with DeVries. As a sidebar, our new office space in Toronto is extremely impressive (cost was Cdn $500K) and is a great selling feature. Hopefully this puts the trading associate ""over the top"". Regards, Milnthorp 
Dave, thanks for the note. Regarding an update for Toronto, we made an offer to a senior industrial marketer yesterday  (Jeff Borg - 10 years experience) while I was in Toronto. I believe that he will accept. In addition, Paul is interviewing for one more deal maker (targeting John Guerro at Duke - an industrial gas marketer) and a manager for ENERconnect   (has interviewed a couple - meeting with Doug Jones from TD Bank next week). Scott Gilbert who is running our volume management is out recruiting for backoffice staff (needs 5 specialists). No success here as of yet. Mark Haedicke, Peter Keohane and myself are working on transferring Chris Gaffney (Canadian Lawyer) to work in Toronto. Chris is interested and both Mark and myself think it would be a good fit/career move. Dawn, Paul and myself are devising a more aggressive recruiting strategy for Toronto for both Paul's and Scott's groups as our presence in Toronto is limited. This may include full page ads in the Globe, use of head hunters and/or Super Saturdays. With 2 million people in Toronto, we should be having more success in recruiting high quality individuals. It is my understanding that 94 new analysts are starting this August in Houston. I need a minimum of 5 (2 for Toronto, 3 for Calgary). I have asked Dawn to make this happen, but if there is any way that you can exercise your influence to assist in making this happen, that would be much appreciated. Regards Milnthorp 
Sounds good - lets see if we can start marketing the product and the capability. Regards Delainey 
Mike, I will want to see those economics. Thanks 
David, once you get the demand lets discuss before deployment. Regards Delainey 
That may work -  I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked hard to eliminate. Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant real value. Will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from JEDI incorporate the write downs we think should occur? Regards Delainey

We also have to support Lay's efforts in California. Regards Delainey 
Dave, I just spoke with Freeman to let him know that we can provide him a letter proposal which I can send out Monday.  In general, we will offer 50MW NP-15 Peak from February 22 - March 31 at a fixed price (currently $265) with payment due every 7 days.  This would be documented under the form of EEI that they have agreed to and is subject to (i) payment of outstanding amounts due Enron; (ii) execution of EEI and confirm; (iii) confirmation that they will pay the amounts due; (iv) good faith obligation to put together creidtworthy structure; (v) good faith look at term deal which can be back-dated to blend with this current deal, Pastoria and Demand Management. It took some time to nail down the settlement numbers on our side.  Legal spent some time with Freeman's attorney but got agreement on the EEI Form. Credit likes this a lot.    Tim will have Lavo wear the market exposure - $2MM if the market falls $100.  David Freeman said he would look at it Monday but it sounded good. I will pull it together and copy you over the weekend. Chris 
Ken, fyi Regards Dave

The b= asic=20 organizational framework has been set.=20 As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new= =20 responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and= =20 Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting= =20 to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.

In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE= O=20 of Elektro until its ultimate sale. The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20 Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in= =20 Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark= =20 Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a= nd=20 Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our= =20 reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20 managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset= s=20 are pursued. The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20 America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo= rk=20 business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20 commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu= e=20 products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and= =20 enjoys high rates of return on invested capital. In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report = to=20 Joe and Orlando: =20 The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will= =20 focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine= =20 natural gas and electricity, with the following goals: ?

This group will be responsible= =20 for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct= =20 reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ= as=20 risk activities. The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20 Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we= =20 will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. = =20 The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati= on=20 that is very market and commercially focused.

Shawn, just a little buried - why don't you come by on Monday. Kay please schedule. Regards 
Chris, I would get Mark or Louise involved at this point - if it is mission critical let me know. Regards Delainey 
Dave, A DASH will be circulating later today for approximately $16MM for $10MM of progress payments on a 7FA and certain development costs for our Longview Project.  Chip Schneider and I have agreed that this approach allows us to get to NTP on the project (up until August 20), or determine a higher-valued use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for some reason.  Given the strength of the PNW market, this project is in the money using Enron mid curves for gas and power. Mike Miller has appropriately backed away - my team is engaged directly with GE on the contract negotiation and a term sheet is expected to be signed tomorrow. I am highly confident that this will result in a 2001 gain of $15MM-$20MM. I was planning to talk with Louise about this at our call this morning.  Are you or she the appropriate signor for EA?  I will also contact Mark Frevert early this afternoon to discuss. Regards, Chris 
Matthew, sounds fine - I will have Kay start managing the calendar. Regards Delainey 
Dave - Thanks - I'll pass on the points.  I am pleased to say you sound as direct and blunt as that other man from the provinces - Pope! As you and Janet will be over before March 12th, I'll postpone my trip until later in the year. Matthew David W Delainey 10/02/2001 00:41 
Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I'll give you a call to discuss further. Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday: - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron and EES; - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001; - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for the large industrial customer); - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that effort; - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals; - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - no bullshit politics; - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership; - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success; - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February early March. PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth. Talk to you soon!! Regards Delainey 
FYI, I'm planning to visit Houston w/c 12th March.  If you and Janet get here first I'll push that trip back a month or two. David W Delainey 09/02/2001 15:53 
ok, let me put something together on e-mail over the next day or so - otherwise we will plan to be in Europe over the next 4 weeks or so. regards delainey 
Dave, It would be really great for you to do that.  Unfortunately we start at 10.30am UK / 4.30am US time (the only slot we could get for the Auditorium). It won't be as cool as a video link up, but if you give me a text message addressed to all European staff, I'll read it out. I'll get the senior guys together on Monday for the weekly EES 2.30pm UK / 8.30am US video conference call so you and Janet can at least speak to them. Let's get you and Janet over to Europe to meet and greet the troops in person later in the year when you guys realise what you have taken on! Matthew David W Delainey 09/02/2001 15:03 
Matthew, would your Monday meeting be a good time (if the time change works) for me to introduce myself and say a few words via video conference or the like to your organization? Regards Delainey
