Peter: Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I was not aware of your previous discussions.  In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge. Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post cash collateral to us? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Peter Keohane 03/20/2001 09:58 AM 
In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely unknowingly). Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA. Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account. In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of, and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue. Peter. Carol St Clair                03/20/2001 07:45 AM 
Peter and Greg: One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

No. 79 Tuesday April 24, 2001	Page A-33 ISSN 1523-567X Regulation, Law & Economics BankruptcyDaschle Says Bankruptcy Reform Stuck As Party Roles in Conference Still in Limbo Bankruptcy legislation (S. 420/H.R. 333) that separately passed the Senate and House earlier this spring remains in limbo, as the Senate still cannot agree on how to proceed to conference with the House, Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters April 23. The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in conference, while Republicans oppose it. Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions. ""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until

Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and were supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit. Therefore, they stayed as Merrill in our books.  Please confirm which are Merrill deals and which are Allegheny.  We will need confirmation after this review with our attorney as to where these deals will be booked. Another question that has arisen is whether Allegheny traders are trading for Merrill Lynch.  These issues need to be resolved so that we do not continue to have these questions when our settlements people try to check out at month

Hi Carol: How are you doing this beautiful morning. Thanks for the telephone call last night. I am thoroughly happy that you are still interested in me. I was hoping you would be. As I mentioned to Nedre Strambler, I have been wanting to work for Enron for quite some time. I believe that Enron is a top class organization. With regard to references, I would appreciate it if you would not contact my present employer at this time, but in the alternative, contact my past employer for references. My immediate supervisors with Star Enterprise were as follows: 1.    Jerome (Jerry) L. Francis, Esq., Sr. Real Estate Specialist  - (713) 241-1823 [PLEASE NOTE, I TRIED TO CONTACT JERRY THIS MORNING AND HE IS ON VACATION. HE WILL RETURN TO THE OFFICE ON THURSDAY, MAY 4, 2000]; and 2.     Gary W. Dzierlenga, Esq., Real Estate Specialist  -  (713) 241-1813. In addition to the above, you may contact the references listed on the Enron Job Application that I completed. After your conversations with the above references, if you feel a need to speak to my current employer references, please advise. Again thank you for your continued interest in me. I look forward to hearing from you real soon. I look forward to becoming a part of the ""swaps and derivitives"" group at ENRON! Have a great day! Don

Joe, Jeff an Bob: Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections to our new form of Annex A: 1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply 2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity. 3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the ""or otherwise"" language in the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue. 4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few days. 5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks. 6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial derivatives with them recently. 7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with their attorney. 8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric. 9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will follow up with their attorney. 10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit should be alerted. 11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response. 12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy. 13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up. 
Tana: Per my voice mail, Luannne Giessen's phone number is 212-902-0580. 
Tana: When you knnow it, please send Suzanne a list of names of people that will be attending. 
I have asked Taffy to schedule an interview with the above candidate from 10:30 -11:30 on Monday.  Sara and I spoke with her today and think that it is apprpritae to have her come back to met you.  Plesae let Taffy know ASAP if you cannot attend.  Hopefully we can make a decision next week. 
Susan: I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go back to our old language. Sara and Mark: Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language

Brant: Their lawyer finally called me.  We have a few open credit issues on our side that I need for you to think about: 1. Are you okay with the cross default threshold on both sides being 3% of stockholders' equity?  They didn't like $100,000,000. 2. For corporate policy reasons, they cannot take advantage of affiliate setoff.  Since I wasn't sure what relationships ENA and its affiliates had with this counterparty, I wasn't sure how strongly you felt about it.  Please advise.

I just talked to Anthony regarding the head count and he said he still doesn't have a final number, but it would be 13 at the most.  Do you want a video conference call or polycom?  How many of our people will be there?  The 
I have a quick follow up appointment tomorrow at 2:15.  I should be back in 
Tana: Could you please talk to Anthony about the need for video conferencing as he mentioned something to Suzanne about needing that and let Suzanne know if we will be hooking anyone else in and if so, who and how?  Alos, does a total of 20 people (which includes our group) sound right to you?  Finally, what time do you want to start?  We have the room from 11:30 to 2?  Please let Suzanne know the above details.  Thanks. 
Joe: I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that. Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC? Carol Larry Joe Hunter 05/18/2000 12:14 PM 
Carol, We've had some issues lately with EnronOnline deals and Puget Sound.  Should this entity always be booked with ECC?  Currently, depending on the index traded, it downloads into Trade Capture as either ENA or ECC.  In speaking with Tana the other day we had decided that whichever Enron entity downloads is the one we should confirm the deal under. thanks, Joe Carol St Clair                05/18/2000 10:02 AM 
Joe: We are entering into an Agreement with Puget Sound Energy, Inc. in which we are agreeing to some chnages to our new form of Annex A.  Enclosed is the new form which we have agreed to which should be attached to all trades done with Puget after February 2, 2000.  Alos enclosed is the Agreement that we will enter into.  Call me if you have any questions. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Please see the enclosed new form of LC that incorporates the additional drawing condition that we discussed as well as the UCP Article 13(b) language. Carol 
Richard: In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with respect to the arbitration and process agent language: 1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be enforced in court? 2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language. I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration issues and questions. Carol 
I need to leave the office today at 5:15 for a class. 
Susan: As we discussed yesterday could you please give to me this morning the Enmax file as well as the files for the amendments that we talked about?  Also, Tana has offerred to help so please get with her to figure out what she can do to bring you up to date.  Maybe she can work on some of the amendments. Thanks. 
Dave: Per my voice mail message, this entity would like to sign the same amendment letter that kinder Morgan signed which I have attached.  Please let me know if this is okay with you.  Thanks. 
I am planning to attend the NYMEX Futures and options Seminar tomorrow from 
Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and here is what we concluded needed to be done: 1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial language 2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language. 3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all circumstances it will say the following: Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in ________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in _______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________. Susan Bailey, Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC? If you have any questions, please call me or Sara. 
Tana: Mark has asked me to handle the Mexico issues in connection with EOL trading.  I understand that you have copies of what has been sent to and received from Mexican counsel.  Could you before you leave tomorrow give me copies of all correspondence as well as copies of the more current questionnaires taht we have been sending out so that I can start following up with them on Monday?  Thanks. 
Tana: My understanding on Utilicorp is that the earliest that the Master would become effective is June 16th.  We will keep you posted. Tana Jones 06/09/2000 09:46 AM 
On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.  Per my discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up for US power and emissions.  This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved by the FERC to trade power.  Until we are provided that info, we cannot open them up for power.  US emissions has been opened. P.S.  If Utilicorp. need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan Bailey, the paralegal  working on the contract. 
Dave: I will check with Tana on this and yes, she will handle the notifications. Carol David Forster@ENRON 06/12/2000 09:23 AM 
Carol, It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number. Can you tell me how many customers will be affected? I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana be handling the change notification? Dave 
Tana: Can you tell me if any of the more recent ETA amendment letters that we have sent out for execution refer to the new termination number?  My recollection is that maybe only 1 or 2 did. Carol

Please plan to attend a lunch this coming Friday in 30C2 with Sara and I and possibly some of the newer credit people to go through basic ISDA, CSA and confirmation issues.  We'll get started around Noon and probably go until 1:30. 
Tana: This would be any ETA amendment to Sections 6(a) and 6(e).  Enclosed is one example.  I don't think that we did that many because this number has only be out there for a few weeks. Carol Tana Jones 06/14/2000 08:58 AM

Please begin using the new ISDA credit worksheet template attached for all credit sent to the financial trading legal team.  I have added sections for elegible swap participant and specified entity.  If you have any questions as to how these new areas (or any of the old areas) are to be filled in, I will be happy to walk you through it. Thanks, Tanya 
Group: Mark has okay'ed having a going away lunch for Rod.  Looks like the week of June 26th works best for Rod.  Please e-mail Suzanne Adams by Monday of next week any days that week that do not work for you so we can pick a date. Thanks. 
Stephanie and Frank: Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my understanding of where things stand: 1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us? 2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you know when that date is. Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions. 
Luanne: Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC would be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating from S&P is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit Support Provider fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the ISDA Schedule we would like to change the 
Luanne: You are right.  There is no need to make a change so we will just amend the MAC language. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com ""Giessen, Luanne"" <luanne.giessen@gs.com> 06/28/2000 08:57 AM 
Frank: I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is considered to be ""signed"" and ""in writing"" if they are required by the Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I will let you know if it is acceptable. Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a ""test"" run on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears. Please call me if you have any questions. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Mary: Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group. Jeff, Stacy and Harry, Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the new form to credit. Thanks for everyone's input.

Luanne: I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit support provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's. Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Tana: As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my records in various stages of negotiation: 1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have been run by Dave. 2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run by Dave. 3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim. 4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March. Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave. 5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave has not reviewed their comments or my response. 6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it. 7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed. 8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed. 9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval. All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my directory under specproj/online.

Tana: I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted. 
Tana: Here is where things stand on Engage: 1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the Engage Canada financial transactions. I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

Luke: I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that ""The Guaranty of Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed thereunder.""

Luke: Here are my comments to the form of Guranty: 1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement. 2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M if the Guaranty only covers Engage US. 3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only be on the Guarantor's right to assign. 4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent. 5.

Morgan Stanley Tana, Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who previously worked in our group).

Hi Carol, Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like to know what outstanding issues we have with the Engage US and Canada ISDA amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up. Hope all is well, Russell 
Russell: I have sent to Mary and Tana the issues that need to be resolved on these 2 amendments.  They are minor but need a lawyer's attention and Mary will coordinate with Luke M. and Suzi on this.

Mary, Per my voice mail to you, I am updating you on the status of the ISDA's we have sent to Engage: 1) Engage Energy US, LP: I spoke to Luke Mickum, the legal person at Engage US (713-877-7446), this morning.  He is looking into what issues need to be reviewed/discussed. According to Carol there are no open issues.  If that is the case can we send executed copy's of the ISDA to him for signature.  Before it is sent off, we need to make sure the correct changes have been made to the Credit Annex, as the credit support provider has changed from my original credit worksheet.  I am not sure if Carol had made those changes in her drafts. 2) Engage Energy Canada, LP According to the Lotus Notes Database, the draft amendment of this contract was also sent to Luke, although he is the US lawyer.  A draft needs to be sent to the Canadian Lawyer, Suzzi Sethi 403-297-0348.  She sent us a draft guaranty for review with the guarantor West Coast Gas Inc.  This counterparty is the new guarantor for Engage Canada and the ISDA Credt Annex needs to be updated accordingly.  Once again, we need to make sure the Credit information is still correct in the original draft.  I have given a copy of the guaranty to Tana, can you please review this and provide your comments to Suzzi. Please let me know if you require any additional information. Thank you, Russell Carol St Clair                08/04/2000 11:58 AM

Hi Carol, Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like to know what outstanding issues we have with the Engage US and Canada ISDA amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up. Hope all is well, Russell 
Leslie: I think that this is the latest draft. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Although we didn't get to discuss this at our credit luncheon, particularly we some of the less-experienced credit folks, when we receive a worksheet from them where the counterparty is a limited partnership, it may be advisable to ask them the following questions: 1. Should the GP be designated as a Specified Entity?  The alternative may be to require the GP to sign a Guaranty and then they would become a credit support provider.  By making the GP a Specified Entity, they get picked up in the cross default, bankruptcy and credit event upon merger provisions. 2. Should there be an additional termination event or event of default that gets triggered if the GP fails to be the GP of the limited partnership? 3. Whose financials are they expecting to receive, the GP's or the LP's? 4. If there are financial tests, who do they pertain to, the GP or the LP? 5. How does the LP qualify as an ESP?  Particularly with some of the less experienced credit folks who have not had to deal with this issue on the physical side, maybe this question should always be asked for every counterparty just to be safe. Let me know what you think. 
I am looking for this file.  Does anyone have it? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Does anyone have any comments to the chnages that I've marked on the Schedule to the Collateral Support Annex?  Please call me or e-mail me if you do so that we can implement them soon. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Tana: This should be pretty straight forward.  The only remaining issue was they needed to put in an effective date for the assignment amendment that they wanted us to sign.  The papers should be in my office.  Call me at home if you have any problems. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Tana Jones 08/01/00 01:14 PM 
Morgan Stanley Is someone from our group working on this? 
Morgan Stanley Tana, Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is working on this. I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all questions to Mark. Could you let me know if you have any info? Thx, Tracyh 
Randy: I've given your letter to Tana Jones (853-3399) who will get it signed here and then coordinate with you in getting it signed.

Luke: I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that ""The Guaranty of Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed thereunder.""

Luke: Here are my comments to the form of Guranty: 1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement. 2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M if the Guaranty only covers Engage US. 3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only be on the Guarantor's right to assign. 4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent. 5. For notice purposes to ENA please add the following: Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Luke.Mickum@EngageEnergy.com 07/10/2000 10:47 AM

Tana: Here is where things stand on Engage: 1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the Engage Canada financial transactions. I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed. 
Russell: I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney which he never responded to. Tana, Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast. The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to you.

Russell: I have sent to Mary and Tana the issues that need to be resolved on these 2 amendments.  They are minor but need a lawyer's attention and Mary will coordinate with Luke M. and Suzi on this. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Russell Diamond 08/09/00 10:05 AM 
Mary, Per my voice mail to you, I am updating you on the status of the ISDA's we have sent to Engage: 1) Engage Energy US, LP: I spoke to Luke Mickum, the legal person at Engage US (713-877-7446), this morning.  He is looking into what issues need to be reviewed/discussed. According to Carol there are no open issues.  If that is the case can we send executed copy's of the ISDA to him for signature.  Before it is sent off, we need to make sure the correct changes have been made to the Credit Annex, as the credit support provider has changed from my original credit worksheet.  I am not sure if Carol had made those changes in her drafts. 2) Engage Energy Canada, LP According to the Lotus Notes Database, the draft amendment of this contract was also sent to Luke, although he is the US lawyer.  A draft needs to be sent to the Canadian Lawyer, Suzzi Sethi 403-297-0348.  She sent us a draft guaranty for review with the guarantor West Coast Gas Inc.  This counterparty is the new guarantor for Engage Canada and the ISDA Credt Annex needs to be updated accordingly.  Once again, we need to make sure the Credit information is still correct in the original draft.  I have given a copy of the guaranty to Tana, can you please review this and provide your comments to Suzzi. Please let me know if you require any additional information. Thank you, Russell Carol St Clair                08/04/2000 11:58 AM

The only negative comment that she had was on a personal basis as she described him as being a ""flirt"" at the firm who on occassion has taken a liking to certain female employees at the firm.  Apparently, with one particular employee he was quite a pest. Carol 
Hi Carol: How are you doing this beautiful morning. Thanks for the telephone call last night. I am thoroughly happy that you are still interested in me. I was hoping you would be. As I mentioned to Nedre Strambler, I have been wanting to work for Enron for quite some time. I believe that Enron is a top class organization. With regard to references, I would appreciate it if you would not contact my present employer at this time, but in the alternative, contact my past employer for references. My immediate supervisors with Star Enterprise were as follows: 1.    Jerome (Jerry) L. Francis, Esq., Sr. Real Estate Specialist  - (713) 241-1823 [PLEASE NOTE, I TRIED TO CONTACT JERRY THIS MORNING AND HE IS ON VACATION. HE WILL RETURN TO THE OFFICE ON THURSDAY, MAY 4, 2000]; and 2.     Gary W. Dzierlenga, Esq., Real Estate Specialist  -  (713) 241-1813. In addition to the above, you may contact the references listed on the Enron Job Application that I completed. After your conversations with the above references, if you feel a need to speak to my current employer references, please advise. Again thank you for your continued interest in me. I look forward to hearing from you real soon. I look forward to becoming a part of the ""swaps and derivitives"" group at ENRON! Have a great day! Don

Tana: FYI.  This is who I am dealing with at J Aron. carol 
Joe, Jeff an Bob: Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections to our new form of Annex A: 1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply 2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity. 3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the ""or otherwise"" language in the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue. 4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few days. 5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks. 6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial derivatives with them recently. 7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with their attorney. 8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric. 9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will follow up with their attorney. 10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit should be alerted. 11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response. 12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy. 13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up. 
Tana: Per my voice mail, Luannne Giessen's phone number is 212-902-0580. 
Tana: When you knnow it, please send Suzanne a list of names of people that will be attending. 
I have asked Taffy to schedule an interview with the above candidate from 10:30 -11:30 on Monday.  Sara and I spoke with her today and think that it is apprpritae to have her come back to met you.  Plesae let Taffy know ASAP if you cannot attend.  Hopefully we can make a decision next week.

Peter: Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I was not aware of your previous discussions.  In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge. Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post cash collateral to us? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Peter Keohane 03/20/2001 09:58 AM 
In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely unknowingly). Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA. Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account. In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of, and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue. Peter. Carol St Clair                03/20/2001 07:45 AM 
Peter and Greg: One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

Brant: Their lawyer finally called me.  We have a few open credit issues on our side that I need for you to think about: 1. Are you okay with the cross default threshold on both sides being 3% of stockholders' equity?  They didn't like $100,000,000. 2. For corporate policy reasons, they cannot take advantage of affiliate setoff.  Since I wasn't sure what relationships ENA and its affiliates had with this counterparty, I wasn't sure how strongly you felt about it.  Please advise. 
We would like to hold a 1/2 day offsite either on Wednesday, May 23 or Thursday, May 24.  Please let me know what your preference would be. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Paul and/or Ken, The following is a summary of AK Steel's credit related comments: 1. Delete Part 1(g) of the Schedule which amends the Credit Event Upon Merger provisions. 2. Delete the reference to ""affiliates"" in setoff. 3. Delete the exclusion of consequential, punitive etc.  damages from the Limitation of Liability section. 4.

Delete the Material Adverse Change and Potential Event of Default triggers from the definition of Threshold.  Delete the concept of Material Adverse Change. 6.

If you are not sure about a file, please call me or stop by.  It has been a pleasure to work with all of you as I continue to believe that out of all of the legal assistant groups, you are the hardest working and brightest, not to mention the fact that the swaps group could not exist and function the way it does without you.

No. 79 Tuesday April 24, 2001	Page A-33 ISSN 1523-567X Regulation, Law & Economics BankruptcyDaschle Says Bankruptcy Reform Stuck As Party Roles in Conference Still in Limbo Bankruptcy legislation (S. 420/H.R. 333) that separately passed the Senate and House earlier this spring remains in limbo, as the Senate still cannot agree on how to proceed to conference with the House, Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters April 23. The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in conference, while Republicans oppose it. Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions. ""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until

I just talked to Anthony regarding the head count and he said he still doesn't have a final number, but it would be 13 at the most.  Do you want a video conference call or polycom?  How many of our people will be there?  The 
I have a quick follow up appointment tomorrow at 2:15.  I should be back in 
Tana: Could you please talk to Anthony about the need for video conferencing as he mentioned something to Suzanne about needing that and let Suzanne know if we will be hooking anyone else in and if so, who and how?  Alos, does a total of 20 people (which includes our group) sound right to you?  Finally, what time do you want to start?  We have the room from 11:30 to 2?  Please let Suzanne know the above details.  Thanks. 
Joe: I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that. Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC? Carol Larry Joe Hunter 05/18/2000 12:14 PM 
Carol, We've had some issues lately with EnronOnline deals and Puget Sound.  Should this entity always be booked with ECC?  Currently, depending on the index traded, it downloads into Trade Capture as either ENA or ECC.  In speaking with Tana the other day we had decided that whichever Enron entity downloads is the one we should confirm the deal under. thanks, Joe Carol St Clair                05/18/2000 10:02 AM 
Joe: We are entering into an Agreement with Puget Sound Energy, Inc. in which we are agreeing to some chnages to our new form of Annex A.  Enclosed is the new form which we have agreed to which should be attached to all trades done with Puget after February 2, 2000.  Alos enclosed is the Agreement that we will enter into.  Call me if you have any questions. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Please see the enclosed new form of LC that incorporates the additional drawing condition that we discussed as well as the UCP Article 13(b) language. Carol 
Richard: In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with respect to the arbitration and process agent language: 1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be enforced in court? 2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language. I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration issues and questions. Carol

Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and were supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit. Therefore, they stayed as Merrill in our books.  Please confirm which are Merrill deals and which are Allegheny.  We will need confirmation after this review with our attorney as to where these deals will be booked. Another question that has arisen is whether Allegheny traders are trading for Merrill Lynch.  These issues need to be resolved so that we do not continue to have these questions when our settlements people try to check out at month 
I need to leave the office today at 5:15 for a class. 
Susan: As we discussed yesterday could you please give to me this morning the Enmax file as well as the files for the amendments that we talked about?  Also, Tana has offerred to help so please get with her to figure out what she can do to bring you up to date.  Maybe she can work on some of the amendments. Thanks. 
Dave: Per my voice mail message, this entity would like to sign the same amendment letter that kinder Morgan signed which I have attached.  Please let me know if this is okay with you.  Thanks. 
Kal: As we discussed, enclosed is a draft of the letter.  Please review and make sure that I have accurately described what will take place and if you find acceptable, please forward on.  If any changes need to be made please call me at 33989. carol 
Tana: Jose is helping us out with some research of online issues in Mexico.  Could you please e-mail to him the Password Application, the ETA and the financial and physical GTC's?  Thanks. Carol 
Hello Jos, Raz-Guzm?n 
I am planning to attend the NYMEX Futures and options Seminar tomorrow from 
Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and here is what we concluded needed to be done: 1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial language 2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language. 3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all circumstances it will say the following: Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in ________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in _______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________. Susan Bailey, Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC? If you have any questions, please call me or Sara. 
Tana: Mark has asked me to handle the Mexico issues in connection with EOL trading.  I understand that you have copies of what has been sent to and received from Mexican counsel.  Could you before you leave tomorrow give me copies of all correspondence as well as copies of the more current questionnaires taht we have been sending out so that I can start following up with them on Monday?  Thanks. 
Tana: My understanding on Utilicorp is that the earliest that the Master would become effective is June 16th.  We will keep you posted. Tana Jones 06/09/2000 09:46 AM 
On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.  Per my discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up for US power and emissions.  This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved by the FERC to trade power.  Until we are provided that info, we cannot open them up for power.  US emissions has been opened. P.S.  If Utilicorp. need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan Bailey, the paralegal  working on the contract. 
Dave: I will check with Tana on this and yes, she will handle the notifications. Carol David Forster@ENRON 06/12/2000 09:23 AM 
Carol, It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number. Can you tell me how many customers will be affected? I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana be handling the change notification? Dave 
Tana: Can you tell me if any of the more recent ETA amendment letters that we have sent out for execution refer to the new termination number?  My recollection is that maybe only 1 or 2 did. Carol

Please plan to attend a lunch this coming Friday in 30C2 with Sara and I and possibly some of the newer credit people to go through basic ISDA, CSA and confirmation issues.  We'll get started around Noon and probably go until 1:30.

Please begin using the new ISDA credit worksheet template attached for all credit sent to the financial trading legal team.  I have added sections for elegible swap participant and specified entity.  If you have any questions as to how these new areas (or any of the old areas) are to be filled in, I will be happy to walk you through it. Thanks, Tanya 
Group: Mark has okay'ed having a going away lunch for Rod.  Looks like the week of June 26th works best for Rod.  Please e-mail Suzanne Adams by Monday of next week any days that week that do not work for you so we can pick a date. Thanks. 
Stephanie and Frank: Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my understanding of where things stand: 1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us? 2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you know when that date is. Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions. 
Tana: I have asked Suzanne to reserve the following dates for the big conference room on 30 for our upcoming lunch seminars:  Friday, May 5th, Thursday, May 25th and Friday, June 16th.  Sara and I are going to try and set something up with the weather group for the May 5th date if that works for them.  Can we plan on scheduleing something with the confirms group and the global contracts group for the other 2 dates?  Sara and I need to talk about what to do with the credit group. 
Please send me an e-mail today with your impressions of this candidate so that I can report back to HR.  Thanks. 
Luanne: Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC would be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating from S&P is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit Support Provider fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the ISDA Schedule we would like to change the 
Luanne: You are right.  There is no need to make a change so we will just amend the MAC language. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com ""Giessen, Luanne"" <luanne.giessen@gs.com> 06/28/2000 08:57 AM 
Frank: I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is considered to be ""signed"" and ""in writing"" if they are required by the Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I will let you know if it is acceptable. Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a ""test"" run on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears. Please call me if you have any questions. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Mary: Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group. Jeff, Stacy and Harry, Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the new form to credit. Thanks for everyone's input.

Luanne: I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit support provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's. Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Tana: As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my records in various stages of negotiation: 1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have been run by Dave. 2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run by Dave. 3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim. 4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March. Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave. 5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave has not reviewed their comments or my response. 6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it. 7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed. 8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed. 9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval. All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my directory under specproj/online.

Tana: I need to get copies pof all of the letters that have been executed that Mark and I have done.  Do you have them?  David F. wants me to prepare a summary of the amendments that we have agreed to. 
Tana: I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted. 
Tana: Here is where things stand on Engage: 1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the Engage Canada financial transactions. I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

Luke: I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that ""The Guaranty of Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed thereunder.""

Luke: Here are my comments to the form of Guranty: 1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement. 2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M if the Guaranty only covers Engage US. 3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only be on the Guarantor's right to assign. 4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent. 5.

Although we didn't get to discuss this at our credit luncheon, particularly we some of the less-experienced credit folks, when we receive a worksheet from them where the counterparty is a limited partnership, it may be advisable to ask them the following questions: 1. Should the GP be designated as a Specified Entity?  The alternative may be to require the GP to sign a Guaranty and then they would become a credit support provider.  By making the GP a Specified Entity, they get picked up in the cross default, bankruptcy and credit event upon merger provisions. 2. Should there be an additional termination event or event of default that gets triggered if the GP fails to be the GP of the limited partnership? 3. Whose financials are they expecting to receive, the GP's or the LP's? 4. If there are financial tests, who do they pertain to, the GP or the LP? 5. How does the LP qualify as an ESP?  Particularly with some of the less experienced credit folks who have not had to deal with this issue on the physical side, maybe this question should always be asked for every counterparty just to be safe. Let me know what you think. 
Elizabeth: Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.  Can you give me your home number?  I think that weekends would be easier to schedule since weekdays are still fairly hectic.  I'll call you soon.

Elizabeth: I had a question about a recurring provision that I have seen in your Power Contracts.  Looks like our credit group accepts a Guaranty from a Counterparty's Credit Support Provider as a form of Performance Assurance to satisfy any collateral posting requirements.  On the financial side, Guarantys always supplement the colateral requirements such that we require them to post cash or LC's to us even if we are holding a parent Guaranty. Why is there a different approach on the power side?  Alos, how does credit value a parent guaranty?  For example, if the parent's financial condition worsens, does the value of the Guaranty drop?  Let me know what you think. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Akasha: I would reword the first sentence as follows: In response to your e-mail dated March 21st and based on all of the information that we have received from you thus far which essentially has only demonstrated that the debt of our Reference Entity's affiliates has been repudiated, we still lack proof of the repudiation by our Reference Entity (and the guarantor of such debt) of its obligations under the Guaranty that supports such debt.  Please provide us such information to demonstrate that a Credit Event has occurred. I will be out of the office tomorrow but will be checking my voice mail.  If you need to consult with someone right away, please contact Sara Shackleton who is familiar with this deal. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Akasha R Bibb@ENRON 03/22/2001 12:39 PM 
Carol, can you check the note below. Thanks Akasha In response to your email dated March 21st, you have not proven whereby the guarantor( ie. the reference entity) has repudiated its obligations under the guarantee for the obligations mentioned in the documents sent to us, in your notice of Publicly Available Information.. We are still awaiting a copy of the Prospectus for the ISIN XS0109296011 US$22.4MM floating rate notes due 2000 and a copy of the guarantee.  Again, we do not believe a Credit Event has yet ocurred. Regards, 
Sara: In the unlikely event taht you are called tomorrow and they can't reach me here is where things stand.  After several internal discussions with Paul, Akasha and Denis O'Connell and based on the information that we have received from DB thus far, it appears as if our Reference Entity's subsidiaries have declared a standstill/moratorium with respect to all of their debt.  Our Reference Entity is the Guarantor of such debt.  We have taken the position that since the Credit Event must occur with respect to our Reference Entity, we need proof that our Reference Entity has repudiated its obligations under its Guaranty.  We feel fairly certain that it has, but DB has not shown us any proof of this.  Paul is calling the paying agent on the defaulted bonds to try and find out and we have sent another e-mail to DB requesting proof. All of the other requirements have been met with respect to the obligations that DB plans to deliver to us next week to settle the contract.  I just need to quickly review the Guaranty that supports such obligations to make sure that it is unconditional.  I expect to see it sometime today. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Paul: I will work with you on this. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Paul Radous/ENRON@enronXgate 03/26/2001 08:31 AM 
Caroline Abramo has initiated a new hedge fund family for financial trading. I am anticipating up to 4 separate masters, but likely only one series of negotiations (the others will likely duplicate the terms of the first one). The paper has started flow in.  Would you please advise which attorney will handle this?  The group is Wexford.  I need to start forwarding up to you copies of the offering memoranda. Thanks. 
Joe and Kim: Sara and  I met with Tanya yesterday and one of the topics that we discussed was making sure that someone was tracking whether our counterparties were signing Omnibus Confirms that had credit terms (i.e. Annex B and B-1).  Can you tell us whether there are any counterparties that aren't signing this type of confirm?  Because collateral is involved, from a legal standpoint, the only way that we may be able to enforce our rights vis a vis the counterparty and/or other creditors is if we can demonstrate that our counterparty entered into a valid security agreement with us.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Mark: I and several other people in our group are concerned about Cheryl's apparent unwillingness to attend on a consistent basis group meetings (i.e., legal/credit meetings and seminars and our legal group meeting) that are held.  I understand from Sara that today Tana had to go and get Cheryl to come to the legal/credit meeting.  Last week, she did not show up for the legal/credit seminar that Brent held.  Could you please talk to her about this?  I am concerned that she is not plugged into our group and is not learning and hearing the things that she needs to be learning and hearing.  I alos think that it is important to act and be like a team on some matters and not an individual.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

All, We are moving the offsite to the morning of May 24th to accommodate a scheduling conflict.  It will start at 8 and last through lunch (1-1:30). Please mark your calendars. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Paul: Will any of the Termination Events have a cure through the posting of=20 collateral?  I'm not sure I understand your first statement given that ther= e=20 is no collateral threshold.  How do the financial covenants fit in?  Are th= ey=20 an Event of default or Termination Event?  Is there a cure?  Please clarify= . =20 Thanks.

Whichever one of you has the great good fortune to work on the subject,=20 please note the following: All 5 additional events of default should also be Material Adverse Changes= =20 with respect to the ability to hold collateral. In addition to the financial triggers indicated in my earlier-emailed credi= t=20 worksheets (FYI=3D=3D> ), the following should be added as additional termi= nation=20 events: 1  The Manager ceases to be either Joseph Kleinman or Simon Glover and an= =20 alternate Manager acceptable to Party A has not assumed the responsibilitie= s=20 of Manager. 2  In the event there exists one Manager, if the Manager resigns, is=20 terminated, or is otherwise incapacitated for a period exceeding one month.= =20 In the event there exists more than one Manager, if for a coincident period= =20 of one month, all of the Managers have resigned, been terminated, or have= =20 otherwise been incapacitated. Add the following definition: ""Manager"" means any person(s) with ultimate authority to direct the=20 investments of Party B, currently Joseph Kleinman and Simon Glover. Replace Independent Amount definition with our new hedge fund standard.  It= =20 is extracted from Union Spring as follows (But change the Independent Amoun= t=20 to be each of the two counterparty's pro rata share of $50,000; The pro rat= a=20 distribution should be based on the allocation of the trade volumes): (A)  =01&Independent Amount=018 means with respect to Party A, the amount s= pecified=20 as such for Party A in each Confirmation, or if no amount is specified, zer= o=20 and means with respect to Party B the amount specified as such for Party B= =20 which may be either increased or decreased from time to time in a=20 Confirmation, which amount as modified shall be the Independent Amount=20 applicable for all outstanding Transactions, provided, however, that in no= =20 event shall Party B=01,s Independent Amount be less than $100,000 if there = are=20 any outstanding Transactions. Add as an additional termination event and Material Adverse Change for Enro= n=20 the following: (ii) The following will constitute an Additional Termination Event with=20 respect to Party A: Party A=01,s Credit Support Provider=01,s credit rating is below BBB- by S&= P, or if=20 it has no credit rating from S&P, Party A=01,s Credit Support Provider=01,s= credit=20 rating is below Baa3 by Moody=01,s, or Party A=01,s Credit Support Provider= fails=20 to have a rating from either S&P or Moody=01,s. =20

Christopher: We have done a trade with a Bermuda hedge fund and have negotiated collateral provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  The agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law.  We need your advice on how to perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we would hold in an account in the United States.  Could you please call either me or Sara Shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can send me an e-mail if that is easier.  I'm hoping that our possession of the cash is enough.  Sorry for the short fuse on this.  If you need any additional information, please contact me or Sara.  I will be unavailable from 9-11 and 2-3 tomorrow Houston time. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Chris: Thanks for your prompt response.  I think that we do need to register the charge document which in this case would be the confirmation that will be executed. Can you provide me with an estimate of the total cost? Does everyone at Enron agree? Caroline, I will redraft the Bermuda confirm to change from LC's to cash and send to you.  Please make sure that the counterparty is aware that we plan to register/file the confirm in Bermuda.

Carol: Regarding a ""hedge fund meeting"" next week, I have spoken with most of the likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend: Fred Lagrasta Caroline Abramo Robyn Zivic Russell Dyk you Brent me I believe that we have a mushrooming ""process"" issue.  I also believe that the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations are that all hedge funds need not be ""last minute"" deals, Caroline can be our ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering. Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

Carol, Your Hedge Fund Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, April 24 at 10:00 am in EB38C2. 
Mary, Sara and Brent: Mark H. has asked me to join Elizabeth's group which I have agreed to do while I continue to support Julia's group on the physical trading side.  I plan to meet with Mark T. later this week to go over what files I will keep and what files I will not keep.  My tentative plan is to finish all of the day to day stuff and to hand over most of the special projects/ longer term stuff.  With that in mind, please give some thought about who should handle the hedge fund work, Canada back-up, the KCS VPP, coordinating our offsite and the remaining legal/credit conferences, negotiating the Japan ISDA's (I have created the forms and drafts of Schedules have been sent out), point person for EIM financial trading issues, and credit derivatives back-up and let me know what you think.

No. 79 Tuesday April 24, 2001	Page A-33 ISSN 1523-567X Regulation, Law & Economics BankruptcyDaschle Says Bankruptcy Reform Stuck As Party Roles in Conference Still in Limbo Bankruptcy legislation (S. 420/H.R. 333) that separately passed the Senate and House earlier this spring remains in limbo, as the Senate still cannot agree on how to proceed to conference with the House, Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters April 23. The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in conference, while Republicans oppose it. Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions. ""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until 
Caroline: Has Joe Hunter prepared the AIG confirms?  As I mentioned earlier this week, once we get the signed confirms and the opinion from AIG we will circulate the ISDA draft.

Sara: The offsite list is still on my list of things to do.  On Montana Power, no draft has been sent.  Please touch base with Tanya as my recollection was that she had a credit issue that needed to be addressed in the draft.  On the swaption, the Exercise date is 6/29 and the confirm requires oral or written notice of its  intent to enter into the transaction, followed up with written confirmation of notice of exercise.

Sorry I didn't reply to this by return.  So far we have had no feedback re any of the newer schedules but these things take time in Japan from my experience.  I guess we will just have to deal with that feedback when we get it - I think though that after all the work you have done in getting the forms into shape, it should be much easier for me to take the lead when things move forward because we will be dealing with standalone issues. I have not replied to IBJ and am hoping to get to this this week.  If I have any questions, in the first case, if you didn't mind I guess it would be good if I could try them on you.  If this didn't work for any reason, I would of course be able to address them to your successor. Re BTM - you may recall that they insisted that we work from their draft. I need to try and finalize my response to them this week and if I have any questions, would propose that I deal with them as above. By the way has your successor been decided? Finally, I have really appreciated the way you helped me out of the jam and hope that I will be able to repay the favor one day. Good luck with power trading - when our power trading business here finally gets on its feet, who knows, we may work together again. Jane Carol St Clair@ECT 2001/04/24 02:54 
Jane: I just wanted to let you know that I have been asked to join Elizabeth Sager's power trading group, effective this week.

Caroline: I have received and reviewed their comments.  On the legal front, they are objecting to the Bermuda law opinion.  We cannot do this without an opinion. If we need to recommend Bermuda counsel to them we can.  On the credit side, for AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP they want to increase the cross default threshold from $1,500,000 to $2,500,000.

Carol, I've just returned to the office after 6 months away, and have discovered that we have not finalized the ISDA documents with Enron, nor the Guaranty. Attached is the file which you emailed to us last year - I'm not sure if there is a more updated version, so perhaps you can confirm. Also, please forward to me Enron's most recent version of Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex, as we have not reviewed that document. On review of the attached file received from you on January 9, 2001, I provide the following comments: Part 3 - delivery of documents, the part requesting Commercial Risks (Party B4s) annual financial statements looks like it needs some clarification. It appears that Enron wants to receive quarterly financials, however we only publish annual statements as a privately held company. Part 5 - Representations - line of business should be removed for Party B. The Guaranty language looks fine with the amendments, so I would suggest that be issued and we can check it off our ""to do"" lists. When we have signed the ISDA Master Agreement and supporting Documents, I will have our General Counsel submit all of the documentation to our Legal Counsel for issuance of the Legal Opinion. I do not foresee any problems in having this issued in a timely fashion. When the minor amendments referenced above have been made, please forward a final, clean draft of the documents to my attention so we can do a final review and issue the documents for signatures. I look forward to hearing from you soon. With kind regards, Laurie Orchard Commercial Risk Capital Markets - ATT00049.txt - 101CTR-BRED.DOC

Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and were supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit. Therefore, they stayed as Merrill in our books.  Please confirm which are Merrill deals and which are Allegheny.  We will need confirmation after this review with our attorney as to where these deals will be booked. Another question that has arisen is whether Allegheny traders are trading for Merrill Lynch.  These issues need to be resolved so that we do not continue to have these questions when our settlements people try to check out at month

Caroline, As I have said from the outset, before we send them an ISDA, we need to obtain from their Bermuda counsel a legal opinion that gives us the assurances that we need that (1) all of the Bermuda transactions have been duly authorized and are enforceable by us against AIG and (2) we have a perfected security interest in any collateral that has been posted by AIG to us.  A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm.  As to point #1, we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process.  As to point #2, we have gotten some comfort from our legal counsel on this but again it is appropriate to have AIG's counsel opine as to this. Please call or e-mail me, Sara or Frank if you have any additional questions. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Carol, West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation (""Kaiser Aluminum"") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (""Kaiser International"") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International which I believe are quite out-of-the-money. Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI? If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as well? If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts. Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June swap, then we'll try for a July swap. Regards,

Tracy: Where does EPMI fit in if we are doing a financial power swap?  Who are the Enron entities that are involved and what contracts are currently in place with the Kaiser entities?  Are we netting overall exposures and using one collateral threshold?  Are we cross defaulting all of the contracts?  What exactly do you want to accomplish with the netting agreement?

Tracy: Here is our form netting agreement.  We should discuss how far we want to go and what provisions we want to use. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Tracy: Paul Simons is the lawyer in London that handles MG matters and I have forwarded this e-mail to him. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Tracy Ngo/ENRON@enronXgate 05/24/2001 04:14 PM 
Rod, Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02. Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward. In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following: ? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc ? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how quickly this out-of-the-money position can move ? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or Master ISDA) ? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a Netting Agreement for UK and US financial Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton about the concept as well. Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in setting up a conference call to push this forward. Thanks, Tracy 
Rod and Paul: I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setoff language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an answer this morning. Rod, If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there other credit issues that need to be considered? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Rod: Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions: 1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold 2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs. 3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an Event of Default occurs. 4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff rights. What is the next step? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Roderick Nelson/Enron@EUEnronXGate 05/25/2001 09:15 AM 
Sara: I asked Sean to contact either you or Mark if anything needs to be done on the financial GTC's for this counterparty. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
Pursuant to our discussion, please find enclosed separate ENA-Mitsui Steel GTC's for physical steel. I have made the requested changes in the following provisions: Clause 1.3 Clause 3.1 Clause 3.2 Clause 4.1 Clause 8 I am also enclosing a redlined version for ease of comparison.  Mark Taylor or Carol St. Clair should be consulted to make any changes to the financial GTC's. 
David: Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze let's talk first.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Mary and Sara: I spoke with Lech about the Article 9 questions.  He is going to send me some articles that they have written which I will send to you.    He alos confirmed that the cash perfection issue has not changed  under new Article 9 although his view on it was that this type of collateral under the UCC is more like a deposit account than ""money"" which, under common law principles, gets perfected through the exercise of dominion and control over the cash. Under the new Article 9, deposit accounts are covered and the new Article 9 codifies the common law control test.  e alos expressed a view that It may take longer than July 1st for NY to adopt the new Article 9.

Kristina, here are the proposed changes to the Assignment Consent Agreement. Our attorney is Carol St. Clair .  Please respond to her (and copy me if via email) with your response to the proposed changes.  She indicated that we are negotiating an amendment to our master with Morgan in order to accommodate this assignment so we will not be executing the Assignment Consent Agreement until Enron and Morgan sign the amendment to our Master with them.   We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of Morgan and MEGA.  She indicated that her revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer how this cutoff date works.  Carol's contact information is below.

Tanya: Some of the people in your group may not be aware of the latest forms that we use for the Enron Guaranty, the Counterparty Guaranty and the letter of credit form that we use for the ISDA, Omnibus, Industrial Master and Deemed ISDA forms.  enclosed are those forms.  We will discuss them with the group tomorrow, but could you circulate them to the group?  Alos, in light of all of the counterparty visits taht are occurring, should we send to the group a form of confidentiality agreement taht they can send to the counterparty? The practice lately has been for us to see the counterparty form and our preference would be to use our form.  Let me know what you think. Carol 
Jaime: Just wanted to update you on the call that I had this morning with Jose and Pablo.  As a general matter, I think that we are going to be okay with offering physical and financial derivative products to Mexican counterparties online.  They are in the process of reviewing the online documents and will get back to me sometime next week with any thoughts or recommendations.  One area that we will need to be careful in is in how we market Enron Online for there are restrictions in connection with the offering of ""securities"". While it is fairly clear that commodity based derivatives are not securities there may be other products where it is not so clear cut.  I think that it would be very helpful if you would send to Jose and Pablo the Online materials (i.e, brochures etc.) that we would plan to send to prospective counterparties so that we can make sure that our marketing efforts don't violate any restrictions taht we would be subject to.

Sara: Per my voice mail. carol 
As I mentioned in my voice mail, here is a sample waiver of conflicts letter we have recently used: 
Lucy: We thought that it would be a good idea to meet with the ""weather"" group to introduce ourselves and alos to go over some of the basics, such as procedures for getting confidentiality agreements processed etc.  Could you send me a list of who you think we should include in this meeting and Sara and I will do the rest?  Will a lunch work? 
Tana: I have asked Suzanne to reserve the following dates for the big conference room on 30 for our upcoming lunch seminars:  Friday, May 5th, Thursday, May 25th and Friday, June 16th.  Sara and I are going to try and set something up with the weather group for the May 5th date if that works for them.  Can we plan on scheduleing something with the confirms group and the global contracts group for the other 2 dates?  Sara and I need to talk about what to do with the credit group. 
Sara: I have never had one executed.  Here are the forms of Annexes that I have used, 1 with the PSA Form (Chase 1/29/98) and the other with the ISMA form. Also I'm sending you some questions that I have asked Kinneman et al in the past. Carol 
Susan: I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go back to our old language. Sara and Mark: Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language 
Shari: I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language: 1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6. I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions? 2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions. Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed? They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating this. Thanks in advance for your help. 
Taffy: Could you please schedule a meeting for next week for our entire group (including Jason Peters) for 11/2 hours to go over changes that need to be made to our forms?  It might be nice given the amount of time to schedule around the lunch hour and order lunch.  Thanks. 
Does anyone know why in our form of LC we have language that seems to qualify Section 13(b) of the UCP which sets forth the amount of time that the issuing bank has to honor drafts?  I don't see anywhere in our form where we modify this Section.  Here ios the current version that we are using. Carol 
Bill and Tanya: Enclosed is a list of ""follow-up"" items that we came up with based on what we talked about last Friday.  Maybe some of these can be discussed at our next group meeting next week so that we are clear on who is handling which issue. Feel free to send me any thoughts you may have on these issues.  We really appreciate the enthusiasm that your group has for these seminars and look forward to doing more of them in the future. Carol 
Sara: Here are the final forms of Annex A for ENA and ECC. Susan: Please make sure that these are put into the form bank. Carol 
Peter: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the following: ""It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives.""  Our current rep is attached.  Is this something that we can agree to? Carol 
Sara: When ENA enters into an ISDA Master with a Canadian counterparty, is that counterparty expected to make the ESP and Options rep?  Does ENA make the Canadian Securities Act rep? 
Brenda: Thanks for the update.  Please route any Alchem stuff to me. Carol Brenda L Funk 05/17/2000 10:32 AM 
As promised, here is an update of the deals we have planned to close this quarter: 1. We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0 structure.  We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if the current Alchemy entities will be used.  Regardless, I'm fairly sure that the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using the Hawaii Master Agreement.  We are hoping to close by May 31st. 2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in the Hawaii Structure.  EES has requested that we put additional warrants of an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.  This should close around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31 transaction to Sara today. That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals. Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any other information I get about any transactions involving swaps. Call if you need any more info.  I will make sure you are on the distribution list for docs. Thanks, B 
Steve: I have reviewed what you sent to Susan Bailey and it looks fine.  Please forward to Susan Bailey for execution after you have  had it executed at your shop.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 
Susan: Could you please when you return on Monday circulate a list of issues that we need to discuss regarding the forms?  Susan Flynn was keeping track of some of those issues after you left.   I would like to try to get those issues addressed next week with the people that we need to talk to so that we can turn a draft of the ISDA Schedules, so please make this a priority.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 
Please see the enclosed new form of LC that incorporates the additional drawing condition that we discussed as well as the UCP Article 13(b) language. Carol 
Richard: In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with respect to the arbitration and process agent language: 1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be enforced in court? 2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language. I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration issues and questions. Carol 
Greg: Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters? 1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct? 2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, Peter: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the following: ""It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives.""  Our current rep is attached.  Is this something that we can agree to? Carol 
Sara: FYI.  Can we talk about this? Carol 
Carol, Set forth below are the form issues: I. Schedule to Master Agreement A. Credit: 1.  Footnote #6 -  do we want to include the additional sentence under Part 1(b) for cross default when ENA's/ECC's counterparty is a financial institution, particular one which is a credit institution of Enron Corp.? 2.

Susan 
Susan: Please add the following to your memo: I(B) Footnotes #4 and 5 - revisit why FDI Act language is added. Consult with Richard Sanders regarding Process Agent, arbitration and Waiver of Jury Trial issues Footnote #22 - Sara to draft language providing for a mutual Termination Event Consult with Shari Stack regarding the need for the additional reps in footnote #55 Sara to confirm that language for footnote #73 can be used as part of our form for all counterparties II(A) Confirm that ""ratings test"" language in definitions of Letter of Credit and Letter of Credit Default works and is what credit wants Decide how ""foreign bank"" language in definition of Letter of Credit should work Confirm that our new Custodian language works for credit II(B) Can footnote #2 be deleted? Thanks. 
Mark, Jason and Sara: Deutsche Bank has requested that we make various ""Securities Act"" reps in the ISDA Schedule in the event that we do equity derivatives.  These reps require us and them to say: 1. To the extent that a Transaction involves the purchase and sale of securities, it will not be registered and the securities cannot be sold except pursuant to a reg statement or exemption. 2. Each party is a QIB or an accredited investor. 3. Unless otherwise set forth in a Confirmation, any securities that a party is required to deliver shall not at the time of delivery constitute restricted securities or be subject to restrictions on transfer. What do you think about this? 
Jarrod: This looked fine to me.  My only comment is that in the definition of Floating Price Payer payment Amount instead of the words ""a sum"" consider using the words ""an amount"". carol Jarrod Cyprow 05/23/2000 02:14 PM 
I have attached a draft for a Prepaid Swap. This deal needs to be structured in such a way that the Fixed price is payed once, and the floating price is then paid every month. Please let me know if I can use the attached Draft. If you have any questions please give me a call (ext. 35700). 
Sara: Here is what CWT prepared for us some time ago. Carol 
Sara and Jason: Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used in each conform: Payment Date NCDC NWS HDD CDD The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station Data Sources Let me know what you think. Carol Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already set forth in the Master? 
Sara and Jason: Shari's response to the message that I sent to you. Carol 
I don't see a problem with this since the language is standard in most of our confirms. One thing though - did the revised  Fallback Reference Weather Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/ him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording. One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have included the language as part of the ISDA Master?  They also need to keep in mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of confirmation. S Carol St Clair 06/01/2000 10:45 AM 
Shari: The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this? Carol

Taffy: Sara and i need about thirty minutes with Mark.  Can you set something up for either tomorrow or before our group meeting on Wednesday?  Today is bad for me.  Thanks. 
Tanya and Sara: Just an update on the ones that I am handling: Aquila/Utilicorp will be in place tomorrow Idacorp should be done this week as i spoke with their counsel today Pancanadian  - we are waiting for them to decide whether they will accept the ISDA form of CSA Reliant - we do have their form and Rod and I are working through credit issues El Paso - I am waiting for a revised draft from them but we are close J Aron - done Tanya Rohauer 06/05/2000 03:25 PM 
Sara, After looking at the list, we are on top of most of it: aquila risk - we should be assigning all the trades to the new Utilicorp ISDA and terminating Aquila Risk master jaron - we have a new ISDA; Jeff probably just isn't reflecting it yet el paso - Brant is currently negotiating the new ISDA The following are in negotiation and are Top 10s: - idacorp - wps -pancanadian -duke energy mktg ltd (i think this one is all but signed) - mieco -dynegy canada I know you have had initial discussions with the counterparties and have discussed the need to put new documentation in place with: - morgan - vitol Lastly, we were waiting on Reliant to give us an updated draft ISDA; however, now that Randy Baker has left Reliant, they are not likely to address for awhile.  Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place. The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy and Sempra are probably the most important of those left.  Dynegy should not be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be more problematic.  Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Tanya 
Sara: What do you think? Carol 
Carol Further to my voice-mail message, please see below.  Can you please let me know whether you are happy for us (in London) to carry out the ISDA negotiations with respect to Anglo American Corporation? Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. Many thanks Deepak 
Add the first one to the ISDA status list. For the S. Africa entity ENA legal needs to be informed of this as they usually deal with S. Africa. Suggest you contact Carol St. Clair as to whether she is happy for us to run with this if we are just going to be doing deals from Europe. Thanks, Edmund Deepak Sitlani 06/06/2000 02:04 PM 
FYI 
Paul We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following entities: Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited. The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation. Can you take a look at this for me please? Thanks Martin 
Suzanne: sara may be setting soemthing up with people in the power group and confirmations group.  We will keep you posted. Carol Suzanne Adams 06/07/2000 12:13 PM 
Are you going to do this meeting?  I've got 30C2 reserved. 
Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and here is what we concluded needed to be done: 1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial language 2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language. 3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all circumstances it will say the following: Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in ________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in _______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________. Susan Bailey, Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC? If you have any questions, please call me or Sara. 
Jeff: We have received a request from the above counterparty to alter the format of the confirmation process on physical and financial deals.  In lieu of signing each confirm that is sent to them, what they want to send back to us is a letter signed by them in which they describe the confirm and indicate whether or not they accept or disagree with the terms thereof and if they disagree with such terms, they will return the confirm.  Are you okay with this procedure? 
Mark and Sara: Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous. The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training. On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to work better is through ""communicating"" to each other.  I firmly believe taht there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude which even I have noticed has been a little different lately. I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided. 
Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations. This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those counterparties that we confirm.  Please let me know if you have any comments on this form or any concerns about implementing this process.  Thanks. Carol 
Ed: Here is a comparison of our form to Clement's.  We need to use our form as it ties more closely into the swap agreements that we use.  Legal will dela with Clement if this is a problem but I suspect that it won't be.  His form, I suspect, is more suited for credit agreements and the like.  I am alos attaching our form which we distributed today for both the Enron Guaranty and the Counterparty Guaranty. Carol 
Susan: Sara and I would like to meet with you sometime on Monday to go over all outstanding work items so we are aware of what can be accomplished before you leave and what may need to be given to the other paralegals.  Can we do that at 10 and can you send to us before then an updated list of your outstanding work assignments? Thanks. 
I was going to attempt to compose some type of farewell poem for Rod for Tuesday.  What I need from you is any things in particular about Rod that you associate with him based on your dealings with him, preferably things that are funny.  If you can think of any, please e-mail them to me. 
Sara: What we have negotiated with Southern was limited to financial trades done under the ISDA.  This was a form that they sent to us that we revised.  It was my understanding that they were going to contact Leslie separately about EPMI physical trades and Stacy about physical gas trades. 
Steve: It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it separately.  Let me know what you think.

Mary: Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group. Jeff, Stacy and Harry, Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the new form to credit. Thanks for everyone's input.

Again, like the counterparty form that I sent around earlier,  this form will need to be modified depending upon the products that need to be covered and the parties involved.

Jaime: Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday? Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed with respect to the online and offline transactions? Jeff: Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the online piece of this? Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
Mark and David: Here is the status of research our counsel in Mexico is doing re online issues. Carol

Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien"" issue in light of the fact that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any agreement that contains a negative pledge.  I winged the amendment to the Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.  Please call me with any comments. Carol 
Susan and Samantha: We are in the process of completing a quarter end project called Project Margaux and have completed the Raptor II project.  With respect to Project Margaux, please coordinate with Mark Evans in London to get closing sets of documents.   With respect to Raptor II, I will leav a message with Alicia Curry at V&E to send you the closing sets.  I will leave with you my closing binder on Raptor I. Sara, It might not be a bad idea to meet with Brenda Funk in the next few weeks to get updated on all of the qaurter end delas. 
Sara: Whoever inherits the Deutsche Bank file from me needs to look at this latest draft.  I will indicate this on the updated memo that I send around shortly. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
Hi Carol: Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+ to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and congratulations. Regards, Steve

Sara: Great news!  I will give her a call on Monday!  Hope all is going well. Again, I'm happy to participate in the legal/credit meeting on Tuesday by phone.  Alos, do we need to go through my memo?  Just call or e-mail me. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Sara Shackleton 07/21/00 11:56 AM 
Sara: We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue. You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke). Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day. (1)  On a ""swap"" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held in a U.S. account). (2)  On a ""credit"" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up

Mark, Kristina, and Carol, In the past few months (before Carol went on maturity leave) I have been communicating with Carol on possible positions available at Enron.  Due to the Moratorium that was in place here at Azurix, unfortunately, I could not speak to anyone at Enron in reference to possible employment opportunities. The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your area or of possible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is detail oriented and possess strong analytical,  communication and interpersonal skills and proficient when it comes to ethical and professional responsibilities within the corporate arena. Thank you for reviewing my resume and I hope to be speaking to each of you in the future.  Many thanks, Barb

Sara: Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want. How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing? I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are having fun. Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he ever wants to play some tennis, please call us. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Sara and Mary: Could we get together for lunch sometime soon so you can update me on what has been happening at the office?  Let me know which dates work best for you in the next few weeks.  My mother in law is coming for a visit next week so can we shoot for sometime the week of November 6th?  Look forward to hearing from you.  Charles is doing great.  Growing like a weed and becoming more interactive with us.  While I miss the office routine, I am really enjoying my time away from the office.

Sara: I am really looking forward to seeing you and Mary next week.  Bill has jury duty on Tuesday and I'm assuming that he will not be picked.  I'll let you know if we need to reschedule.  I am doing well and so are the boys.  I played tennis with Elizabeth Sager yesterday and got caught up a little bit on what has been going on but it looks like things have changed alot since my departure.  How are things with you, both personally and professionally?  How is the group doing?  I'm having lunch with Mark T. the week after next at which time I hope to get a better idea of what his plans are for me should I return to work next year.  Drop me an e-mail if you can and see you next week. Carol

Kevin: Sara and I were discussing the additional utility provisions that we typically insert into our ISDA MAster Schedule when we are dealing with a regulated counterparty.  As a general rule, most of these counterparties object to such provisions.  In light of this, we thought that as a compromise we would eliminate the Information Sheet, the ""additional reps"" and the additional covenants and rely on inserting the following as an Additional Termination Event: ""the filing of a motion, pleading, application or other similar action in any proceeding or action by Party B, a commission, regulatory agency or other entity having jurisdiction over Party B, in respect of Party B, or in respect of any other similarly situated entity organized under the laws of the state(s) in which Party B is located or regulated to the effect that performance under this Agreement or one or more Transactions hereunder or similar agreements is unlawful or that this Agreement or one or more 
Elizabeth: We are in the process of negotiating 2 ISDA masters with a counterparty, 1 with ENA and 1 with PGE.  In looking at our setoff language, it would appear as if under certain circumstances the application of such language would result in PGE subsidizing ENA's payment obligations.  How would you suggest we handle this?  If we do nothing and such provision is unenforceable and we rely on our severability language, are we okay? 
David: In the severability language that you sent to me, one of the Sections that is referenced after the proviso is Section 13 of the ISDA Master which as you know covers governing law and jurisdiction.  In our Schedule, we typically amend  section 13 (b) to provide for arbitration.  We just want to make sure that the language in the proviso should refer to both the governing law provision as well as the jurisdiction/arbitration provisions.  I look forward to hearing from you. 
sara: One of the Japanese banks that we are dealing with wants the enclosed language in the schedule.  This is very similar to our forward rate agreement language.    Have you ever seen this before? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Please let me know. Also, I spoke with Mark and I'd like to sit down with you to do some brainstorming/planning, e.g., a group offsite, in-house training, form changes.

Sara: Any chance you are available at 1:30pm on Wednesday for a call regarding the Enron/Corrugated Services ISDA?  If that time will not work for you, please suggest another time tomorrow afternoon that would. Also, you will be receiving on Thursday morning a copy of some of the more relevant documentation relating to the June 2000 drop down of the Corrugated Services, Inc. operating assets and liabilities (including the original Enron/Corrugated Services, Inc. ISDA) into a newly formed limited partnership known as Corrugated Services, L.P.  In connection with that transaction, Corrugated Services, Inc. changed its name to CSI Holdings, Inc.  CSI Holdings, Inc. also formed at that time and now owns 100% of CSI GP, Inc., which entity serves as the general partner of Corrugated Services, L.P.  All of this was done to create a more franchise tax efficient operating and ownership structure. Based on the foregoing, we believe that it will be necessary to redocument the original agreement either through an amendment thereto or the cancellation thereof and the creation of a new LP/Enron agreement. We plan on discussing the foregoing during our call tomorrow afternoon.

Sara: Just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics: 1.  credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define the ""materially weaker"" standard.  Alos, I'm wondering how credit monitors mergers in general. 2.  additional termination events - when does credit consider additional events like change of control, MAC, chnages to partnership agreement or structure etc. 3.  minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the threshold 4.  threshold amount - what triggers makes it reduce to zero 5.  enforcement of collateral remedies - going over the timetable for enforcing our remedies when a counterparty fails to post and the different cure periods. 6.  letter of credit bank qualifications - confirming with credit that these are still current 7.  cash collateral in Canada Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Sara Shackleton 02/20/2001 09:47 AM

Peter and Greg: One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask Stikeman to update their advice to us on this? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Peter: Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I was not aware of your previous discussions.  In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge. Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post cash collateral to us? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Peter Keohane 03/20/2001 09:58 AM 
In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely unknowingly). Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA. Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account. In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of, and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue. Peter.

Akasha: As we discussed, the following are my questions: 1. We need some verification that the debt that is referred to in the articles is the debt of Asia Pulp & Paper Co. Ltd.

We need to confirm that the debt that is the subject of the standstill meets the following characteristics: - it is a bond or a loan - it ranks pari passu with other senior, unsecured debt of Asia Ltd. - it is not payable in the currency of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized - it is not governed by the law of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Elizabeth, Per my voice mail here is what credit wants to explore.  If we have an ISDA in place with a non-regulated affiliate of a utility, they want to create some credit triggers that would be based on events that occur with respect to our counterparty's regulated utility affiliate.  Can this be done?  Could we, for example, have a drop in the credit rating of the utility trigger a MAC? Could we cross default to the utility's physical and/or financial transactions?  I know that there are limitations on what can be done, I just didn't know how extensive they were. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Carol= Paul is OK with raising the cross default amount... can we get out draft ISDAs to them???? AIG Commodity Arbitrage Ltd. and AIG Commodity Fund L.P. Thanks, Caroline 
Caroline: I have received and reviewed their comments.  On the legal front, they are objecting to the Bermuda law opinion.  We cannot do this without an opinion.

Carol= Paul is OK with raising the cross default amount... can we get out draft ISDAs to them???? AIG Commodity Arbitrage Ltd. and AIG Commodity Fund L.P. Thanks, Caroline 
Caroline: I have received and reviewed their comments.  On the legal front, they are objecting to the Bermuda law opinion.  We cannot do this without an opinion.

Carol- I know you are out today.. but can you let me know today if we have answered DKR (AIGs) questions and received back confirms from them.. We did another deal with them on Friday.  I'd like to get them ISDA's for their two entities.. why have we not sent these out again??? Regards, Caroline

Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and were supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit. Therefore, they stayed as Merrill in our books.  Please confirm which are Merrill deals and which are Allegheny.  We will need confirmation after this review with our attorney as to where these deals will be booked. Another question that has arisen is whether Allegheny traders are trading for Merrill Lynch.  These issues need to be resolved so that we do not continue to have these questions when our settlements people try to check out at month

Carol, I've just returned to the office after 6 months away, and have discovered that we have not finalized the ISDA documents with Enron, nor the Guaranty. Attached is the file which you emailed to us last year - I'm not sure if there is a more updated version, so perhaps you can confirm. Also, please forward to me Enron's most recent version of Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex, as we have not reviewed that document. On review of the attached file received from you on January 9, 2001, I provide the following comments: Part 3 - delivery of documents, the part requesting Commercial Risks (Party B4s) annual financial statements looks like it needs some clarification. It appears that Enron wants to receive quarterly financials, however we only publish annual statements as a privately held company. Part 5 - Representations - line of business should be removed for Party B. The Guaranty language looks fine with the amendments, so I would suggest that be issued and we can check it off our ""to do"" lists. When we have signed the ISDA Master Agreement and supporting Documents, I will have our General Counsel submit all of the documentation to our Legal Counsel for issuance of the Legal Opinion. I do not foresee any problems in having this issued in a timely fashion. When the minor amendments referenced above have been made, please forward a final, clean draft of the documents to my attention so we can do a final review and issue the documents for signatures. I look forward to hearing from you soon. With kind regards, Laurie Orchard Commercial Risk Capital Markets - ATT00049.txt - 101CTR-BRED.DOC 
Caroline: Please make sure that they know that in addition to the signed confirms, we need the legal opinion.  I'm in meetings after 2 today so try to catch me before then.

I am getting the confirm back..their lawyer has a question.. we will call you with him today.  Hope to get the ISDAs out to them too. 
Sara: The offsite list is still on my list of things to do.  On Montana Power, no draft has been sent.  Please touch base with Tanya as my recollection was that she had a credit issue that needed to be addressed in the draft.

I think the following people should attend: Fred Lagrasta Caroline Abramo Robyn Zivic Russell Dyk you Brent me I believe that we have a mushrooming ""process"" issue.  I also believe that the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations are that all hedge funds need not be ""last minute"" deals, Caroline can be our ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering. Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

Kristina, here are the proposed changes to the Assignment Consent Agreement. Our attorney is Carol St. Clair .  Please respond to her (and copy me if via email) with your response to the proposed changes.  She indicated that we are negotiating an amendment to our master with Morgan in order to accommodate this assignment so we will not be executing the Assignment Consent Agreement until Enron and Morgan sign the amendment to our Master with them.   We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of Morgan and MEGA.  She indicated that her revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer how this cutoff date works.  Carol's contact information is below.

Paul: Will any of the Termination Events have a cure through the posting of=20 collateral?  I'm not sure I understand your first statement given that ther= e=20 is no collateral threshold.

Whichever one of you has the great good fortune to work on the subject,=20 please note the following: All 5 additional events of default should also be Material Adverse Changes= =20 with respect to the ability to hold collateral. In addition to the financial triggers indicated in my earlier-emailed credi= t=20 worksheets (FYI=3D=3D> ), the following should be added as additional termi= nation=20 events: 1  The Manager ceases to be either Joseph Kleinman or Simon Glover and an= =20 alternate Manager acceptable to Party A has not assumed the responsibilitie= s=20 of Manager. 2  In the event there exists one Manager, if the Manager resigns, is=20 terminated, or is otherwise incapacitated for a period exceeding one month.= =20 In the event there exists more than one Manager, if for a coincident period= =20 of one month, all of the Managers have resigned, been terminated, or have= =20 otherwise been incapacitated. Add the following definition: ""Manager"" means any person(s) with ultimate authority to direct the=20 investments of Party B, currently Joseph Kleinman and Simon Glover. Replace Independent Amount definition with our new hedge fund standard.  It= =20 is extracted from Union Spring as follows (But change the Independent Amoun= t=20 to be each of the two counterparty's pro rata share of $50,000; The pro rat= a=20 distribution should be based on the allocation of the trade volumes): (A)  =01&Independent Amount=018 means with respect to Party A, the amount s= pecified=20 as such for Party A in each Confirmation, or if no amount is specified, zer= o=20 and means with respect to Party B the amount specified as such for Party B= =20 which may be either increased or decreased from time to time in a=20 Confirmation, which amount as modified shall be the Independent Amount=20 applicable for all outstanding Transactions, provided, however, that in no= =20 event shall Party B=01,s Independent Amount be less than $100,000 if there = are=20 any outstanding Transactions.

Mark: I and several other people in our group are concerned about Cheryl's apparent unwillingness to attend on a consistent basis group meetings (i.e., legal/credit meetings and seminars and our legal group meeting) that are held.  I understand from Sara that today Tana had to go and get Cheryl to come to the legal/credit meeting.  Last week, she did not show up for the legal/credit seminar that Brent held.  Could you please talk to her about this?  I am concerned that she is not plugged into our group and is not learning and hearing the things that she needs to be learning and hearing.  I alos think that it is important to act and be like a team on some matters and not an individual.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Joe and Kim: Sara and  I met with Tanya yesterday and one of the topics that we discussed was making sure that someone was tracking whether our counterparties were signing Omnibus Confirms that had credit terms (i.e. Annex B and B-1).  Can you tell us whether there are any counterparties that aren't signing this type of confirm?  Because collateral is involved, from a legal standpoint, the only way that we may be able to enforce our rights vis a vis the counterparty and/or other creditors is if we can demonstrate that our counterparty entered into a valid security agreement with us.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Caroline Abramo has initiated a new hedge fund family for financial trading. I am anticipating up to 4 separate masters, but likely only one series of negotiations (the others will likely duplicate the terms of the first one). The paper has started flow in.  Would you please advise which attorney will handle this?  The group is Wexford.  I need to start forwarding up to you copies of the offering memoranda. Thanks. 
Mark, Sara and Mary: Jim would like to talk to someone about problems he is having with his customers concerning the ISDA and CSA forms.

Sara: In the unlikely event taht you are called tomorrow and they can't reach me here is where things stand.  After several internal discussions with Paul, Akasha and Denis O'Connell and based on the information that we have received from DB thus far, it appears as if our Reference Entity's subsidiaries have declared a standstill/moratorium with respect to all of their debt.  Our Reference Entity is the Guarantor of such debt.  We have taken the position that since the Credit Event must occur with respect to our Reference Entity, we need proof that our Reference Entity has repudiated its obligations under its Guaranty.  We feel fairly certain that it has, but DB has not shown us any proof of this.  Paul is calling the paying agent on the defaulted bonds to try and find out and we have sent another e-mail to DB requesting proof. All of the other requirements have been met with respect to the obligations that DB plans to deliver to us next week to settle the contract.  I just need to quickly review the Guaranty that supports such obligations to make sure that it is unconditional.  I expect to see it sometime today. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Akasha: I would reword the first sentence as follows: In response to your e-mail dated March 21st and based on all of the information that we have received from you thus far which essentially has only demonstrated that the debt of our Reference Entity's affiliates has been repudiated, we still lack proof of the repudiation by our Reference Entity (and the guarantor of such debt) of its obligations under the Guaranty that supports such debt.  Please provide us such information to demonstrate that a Credit Event has occurred. I will be out of the office tomorrow but will be checking my voice mail.  If you need to consult with someone right away, please contact Sara Shackleton who is familiar with this deal. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Akasha R Bibb@ENRON 03/22/2001 12:39 PM 
Carol, can you check the note below. Thanks Akasha In response to your email dated March 21st, you have not proven whereby the guarantor( ie. the reference entity) has repudiated its obligations under the guarantee for the obligations mentioned in the documents sent to us, in your notice of Publicly Available Information.. We are still awaiting a copy of the Prospectus for the ISIN XS0109296011 US$22.4MM floating rate notes due 2000 and a copy of the guarantee.  Again, we do not believe a Credit Event has yet ocurred. Regards, 
Elizabeth: I had a question about a recurring provision that I have seen in your Power Contracts.  Looks like our credit group accepts a Guaranty from a Counterparty's Credit Support Provider as a form of Performance Assurance to satisfy any collateral posting requirements.  On the financial side, Guarantys always supplement the colateral requirements such that we require them to post cash or LC's to us even if we are holding a parent Guaranty. Why is there a different approach on the power side?  Alos, how does credit value a parent guaranty?  For example, if the parent's financial condition worsens, does the value of the Guaranty drop?  Let me know what you think. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Elizabeth, Per my voice mail here is what credit wants to explore.  If we have an ISDA in place with a non-regulated affiliate of a utility, they want to create some credit triggers that would be based on events that occur with respect to our counterparty's regulated utility affiliate.  Can this be done?  Could we, for example, have a drop in the credit rating of the utility trigger a MAC? Could we cross default to the utility's physical and/or financial transactions?  I know that there are limitations on what can be done, I just didn't know how extensive they were. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Akasha: As we discussed, the following are my questions: 1. We need some verification that the debt that is referred to in the articles is the debt of Asia Pulp & Paper Co. Ltd. (""Asia Ltd.""), the entity referred to in the Confirm and that the amount that is the subject of the standstill is at least 10 million. 2. We need to confirm that the debt that is the subject of the standstill meets the following characteristics: - it is a bond or a loan - it ranks pari passu with other senior, unsecured debt of Asia Ltd. - it is not payable in the currency of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized - it is not governed by the law of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Peter: Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I was not aware of your previous discussions.  In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge. Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post cash collateral to us?

Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely unknowingly). Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA. Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account. In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of, and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue. Peter.

Peter and Greg: One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

David: Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze let's talk first.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Sara: I have reviewed Tanya's list and of the ones that she told us to pursue, it appears as if from our Lotus Notes entries that we are in fact  in the process of getting ISDA's put in place.  That leaves us with Fred's customers (other than Cross Timbers which we are getting an ISDA in place).  Any thoughts on how we should proceed?  Should we focus on the remaining counterparties on Joe's list or others?  Please advise. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Carol- I need this today ... ASAP...they want to trade... please call.. thanks you very much . 
Sara: I asked Sean to contact either you or Mark if anything needs to be done on the financial GTC's for this counterparty. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
Pursuant to our discussion, please find enclosed separate ENA-Mitsui Steel GTC's for physical steel. I have made the requested changes in the following provisions: Clause 1.3 Clause 3.1 Clause 3.2 Clause 4.1 Clause 8 I am also enclosing a redlined version for ease of comparison.  Mark Taylor or Carol St. Clair should be consulted to make any changes to the financial GTC's. 
Does anyone have any comments to the chnages that I've marked on the Schedule to the Collateral Support Annex?  Please call me or e-mail me if you do so that we can implement them soon. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Sara: Just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics: 1.  credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define the ""materially weaker"" standard.  Alos, I'm wondering how credit monitors mergers in general. 2.  additional termination events - when does credit consider additional events like change of control, MAC, chnages to partnership agreement or structure etc. 3.  minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the threshold 4.  threshold amount - what triggers makes it reduce to zero 5.  enforcement of collateral remedies - going over the timetable for enforcing our remedies when a counterparty fails to post and the different cure periods. 6.  letter of credit bank qualifications - confirming with credit that these are still current 7.  cash collateral in Canada Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Sara Shackleton 02/20/2001 09:47 AM

David: In the severability language that you sent to me, one of the Sections that is referenced after the proviso is Section 13 of the ISDA Master which as you know covers governing law and jurisdiction.  In our Schedule, we typically amend  section 13 (b) to provide for arbitration.  We just want to make sure that the language in the proviso should refer to both the governing law provision as well as the jurisdiction/arbitration provisions.  I look forward to hearing from you. 
Elizabeth: We are in the process of negotiating 2 ISDA masters with a counterparty, 1 with ENA and 1 with PGE.  In looking at our setoff language, it would appear as if under certain circumstances the application of such language would result in PGE subsidizing ENA's payment obligations.  How would you suggest we handle this?  If we do nothing and such provision is unenforceable and we rely on our severability language, are we okay? 
Kevin: Sara and I were discussing the additional utility provisions that we typically insert into our ISDA MAster Schedule when we are dealing with a regulated counterparty.  As a general rule, most of these counterparties object to such provisions.  In light of this, we thought that as a compromise we would eliminate the Information Sheet, the ""additional reps"" and the additional covenants and rely on inserting the following as an Additional Termination Event: ""the filing of a motion, pleading, application or other similar action in any proceeding or action by Party B, a commission, regulatory agency or other entity having jurisdiction over Party B, in respect of Party B, or in respect of any other similarly situated entity organized under the laws of the state(s) in which Party B is located or regulated to the effect that performance under this Agreement or one or more Transactions hereunder or similar agreements is unlawful or that this Agreement or one or more 
Mark: I and several other people in our group are concerned about Cheryl's apparent unwillingness to attend on a consistent basis group meetings (i.e., legal/credit meetings and seminars and our legal group meeting) that are held.  I understand from Sara that today Tana had to go and get Cheryl to come to the legal/credit meeting.  Last week, she did not show up for the legal/credit seminar that Brent held.  Could you please talk to her about this?  I am concerned that she is not plugged into our group and is not learning and hearing the things that she needs to be learning and hearing.  I alos think that it is important to act and be like a team on some matters and not an individual.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Sara: Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want. How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing? I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are having fun. Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he ever wants to play some tennis, please call us. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Mark, Kristina, and Carol, In the past few months (before Carol went on maturity leave) I have been communicating with Carol on possible positions available at Enron.  Due to the Moratorium that was in place here at Azurix, unfortunately, I could not speak to anyone at Enron in reference to possible employment opportunities. The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your area or of possible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is detail oriented and possess strong analytical,  communication and interpersonal skills and proficient when it comes to ethical and professional responsibilities within the corporate arena. Thank you for reviewing my resume and I hope to be speaking to each of you in the future.  Many thanks, Barb 
Sara: We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue. You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke). Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day. (1)  On a ""swap"" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held in a U.S. account). (2)  On a ""credit"" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up 
Sara: Great news!  I will give her a call on Monday!  Hope all is going well. Again, I'm happy to participate in the legal/credit meeting on Tuesday by phone.  Alos, do we need to go through my memo?  Just call or e-mail me. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Sara Shackleton 07/21/00 11:56 AM

Sara: Whoever inherits the Deutsche Bank file from me needs to look at this latest draft.  I will indicate this on the updated memo that I send around shortly. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
Hi Carol: Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+ to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and congratulations. Regards, Steve

Susan and Samantha: We are in the process of completing a quarter end project called Project Margaux and have completed the Raptor II project.  With respect to Project Margaux, please coordinate with Mark Evans in London to get closing sets of documents.   With respect to Raptor II, I will leav a message with Alicia Curry at V&E to send you the closing sets.  I will leave with you my closing binder on Raptor I. Sara, It might not be a bad idea to meet with Brenda Funk in the next few weeks to get updated on all of the qaurter end delas. 
Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien"" issue in light of the fact that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any agreement that contains a negative pledge.  I winged the amendment to the Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.  Please call me with any comments. Carol

Jaime: Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday? Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed with respect to the online and offline transactions? Jeff: Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the online piece of this? Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

Mary: Enclosed is the form of Enron Guaranty that we would propose using for multi-products.  Again, like the counterparty form that I sent around earlier,  this form will need to be modified depending upon the products that need to be covered and the parties involved.  Please distribute as appropriate to the credit group. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Mary: Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group. Jeff, Stacy and Harry, Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the new form to credit. Thanks for everyone's input.

Steve: It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it separately.  Let me know what you think. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Sara: What we have negotiated with Southern was limited to financial trades done under the ISDA.  This was a form that they sent to us that we revised.  It was my understanding that they were going to contact Leslie separately about EPMI physical trades and Stacy about physical gas trades. 
Susan: Sara and I would like to meet with you sometime on Monday to go over all outstanding work items so we are aware of what can be accomplished before you leave and what may need to be given to the other paralegals.  Can we do that at 10 and can you send to us before then an updated list of your outstanding work assignments? Thanks. 
Ed: Here is a comparison of our form to Clement's.  We need to use our form as it ties more closely into the swap agreements that we use.  Legal will dela with Clement if this is a problem but I suspect that it won't be.  His form, I suspect, is more suited for credit agreements and the like.  I am alos attaching our form which we distributed today for both the Enron Guaranty and the Counterparty Guaranty. Carol 
Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations. This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those counterparties that we confirm.  Please let me know if you have any comments on this form or any concerns about implementing this process.  Thanks. Carol 
Mark and Sara: Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous. The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training. On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to work better is through ""communicating"" to each other.  I firmly believe taht there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude which even I have noticed has been a little different lately. I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided. 
Jeff: We have received a request from the above counterparty to alter the format of the confirmation process on physical and financial deals.  In lieu of signing each confirm that is sent to them, what they want to send back to us is a letter signed by them in which they describe the confirm and indicate whether or not they accept or disagree with the terms thereof and if they disagree with such terms, they will return the confirm.  Are you okay with this procedure? 
Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and here is what we concluded needed to be done: 1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial language 2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language. 3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all circumstances it will say the following: Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in ________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in _______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________. Susan Bailey, Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC? If you have any questions, please call me or Sara. 
Sara: What do you think? Carol 
Carol Further to my voice-mail message, please see below.  Can you please let me know whether you are happy for us (in London) to carry out the ISDA negotiations with respect to Anglo American Corporation? Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. Many thanks Deepak 
Add the first one to the ISDA status list. For the S. Africa entity ENA legal needs to be informed of this as they usually deal with S. Africa. Suggest you contact Carol St. Clair as to whether she is happy for us to run with this if we are just going to be doing deals from Europe. Thanks, Edmund Deepak Sitlani 06/06/2000 02:04 PM

Paul We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following entities: Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited. The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation. Can you take a look at this for me please? Thanks Martin 
Tanya and Sara: Just an update on the ones that I am handling: Aquila/Utilicorp will be in place tomorrow Idacorp should be done this week as i spoke with their counsel today Pancanadian  - we are waiting for them to decide whether they will accept the ISDA form of CSA Reliant - we do have their form and Rod and I are working through credit issues El Paso - I am waiting for a revised draft from them but we are close J Aron - done Tanya Rohauer 06/05/2000 03:25 PM 
Sara, After looking at the list, we are on top of most of it: aquila risk - we should be assigning all the trades to the new Utilicorp ISDA and terminating Aquila Risk master jaron - we have a new ISDA; Jeff probably just isn't reflecting it yet el paso - Brant is currently negotiating the new ISDA The following are in negotiation and are Top 10s: - idacorp - wps -pancanadian -duke energy mktg ltd (i think this one is all but signed) - mieco -dynegy canada I know you have had initial discussions with the counterparties and have discussed the need to put new documentation in place with: - morgan - vitol Lastly, we were waiting on Reliant to give us an updated draft ISDA; however, now that Randy Baker has left Reliant, they are not likely to address for awhile.  Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place. The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy and Sempra are probably the most important of those left.  Dynegy should not be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be more problematic.  Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Tanya 
Sara and Jason: Shari's response to the message that I sent to you. Carol 
I don't see a problem with this since the language is standard in most of our confirms. One thing though - did the revised  Fallback Reference Weather Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/ him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording. One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have included the language as part of the ISDA Master?  They also need to keep in mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of confirmation. S Carol St Clair 06/01/2000 10:45 AM 
Shari: The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this? Carol 
Sara and Jason: Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used in each conform: Payment Date NCDC NWS HDD CDD The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station Data Sources Let me know what you think. Carol Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already set forth in the Master?

Carol Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already set forth in the Master? 
Sara: Here is what CWT prepared for us some time ago. Carol 
Jarrod: This looked fine to me.  My only comment is that in the definition of Floating Price Payer payment Amount instead of the words ""a sum"" consider using the words ""an amount"". carol Jarrod Cyprow 05/23/2000 02:14 PM 
I have attached a draft for a Prepaid Swap. This deal needs to be structured in such a way that the Fixed price is payed once, and the floating price is then paid every month. Please let me know if I can use the attached Draft. If you have any questions please give me a call (ext. 35700). 
Mark, Jason and Sara: Deutsche Bank has requested that we make various ""Securities Act"" reps in the ISDA Schedule in the event that we do equity derivatives.  These reps require us and them to say: 1. To the extent that a Transaction involves the purchase and sale of securities, it will not be registered and the securities cannot be sold except pursuant to a reg statement or exemption. 2. Each party is a QIB or an accredited investor. 3. Unless otherwise set forth in a Confirmation, any securities that a party is required to deliver shall not at the time of delivery constitute restricted securities or be subject to restrictions on transfer. What do you think about this? 
Susan: Please add the following to your memo: I(B) Footnotes #4 and 5 - revisit why FDI Act language is added. Consult with Richard Sanders regarding Process Agent, arbitration and Waiver of Jury Trial issues Footnote #22 - Sara to draft language providing for a mutual Termination Event Consult with Shari Stack regarding the need for the additional reps in footnote #55 Sara to confirm that language for footnote #73 can be used as part of our form for all counterparties II(A) Confirm that ""ratings test"" language in definitions of Letter of Credit and Letter of Credit Default works and is what credit wants Decide how ""foreign bank"" language in definition of Letter of Credit should work Confirm that our new Custodian language works for credit II(B) Can footnote #2 be deleted? Thanks. 
Greg: Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters? 1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct? 2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, Peter: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the following: ""It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives.""  Our current rep is attached.  Is this something that we can agree to? Carol 
Richard: In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with respect to the arbitration and process agent language: 1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be enforced in court? 2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language. I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration issues and questions. Carol 
Please see the enclosed new form of LC that incorporates the additional drawing condition that we discussed as well as the UCP Article 13(b) language. Carol 
Susan: Could you please when you return on Monday circulate a list of issues that we need to discuss regarding the forms?  Susan Flynn was keeping track of some of those issues after you left.   I would like to try to get those issues addressed next week with the people that we need to talk to so that we can turn a draft of the ISDA Schedules, so please make this a priority.  Thanks.

As promised, here is an update of the deals we have planned to close this quarter: 1. We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0 structure.  We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if the current Alchemy entities will be used.  Regardless, I'm fairly sure that the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using the Hawaii Master Agreement.  We are hoping to close by May 31st. 2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in the Hawaii Structure.  EES has requested that we put additional warrants of an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.  This should close around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31 transaction to Sara today. That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals. Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any other information I get about any transactions involving swaps. Call if you need any more info.  I will make sure you are on the distribution list for docs. Thanks, B 
Sara: When ENA enters into an ISDA Master with a Canadian counterparty, is that counterparty expected to make the ESP and Options rep?  Does ENA make the Canadian Securities Act rep? 
Peter: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the following: ""It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives.""  Our current rep is attached.  Is this something that we can agree to? Carol 
Sara: Here are the final forms of Annex A for ENA and ECC. Susan: Please make sure that these are put into the form bank. Carol 
Bill and Tanya: Enclosed is a list of ""follow-up"" items that we came up with based on what we talked about last Friday.  Maybe some of these can be discussed at our next group meeting next week so that we are clear on who is handling which issue. Feel free to send me any thoughts you may have on these issues.  We really appreciate the enthusiasm that your group has for these seminars and look forward to doing more of them in the future. Carol 
Does anyone know why in our form of LC we have language that seems to qualify Section 13(b) of the UCP which sets forth the amount of time that the issuing bank has to honor drafts?  I don't see anywhere in our form where we modify this Section.  Here ios the current version that we are using. Carol 
Taffy: Could you please schedule a meeting for next week for our entire group (including Jason Peters) for 11/2 hours to go over changes that need to be made to our forms?  It might be nice given the amount of time to schedule around the lunch hour and order lunch.  Thanks. 
Shari: I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language: 1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6. I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions? 2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions. Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed? They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating this. Thanks in advance for your help. 
Susan: I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go back to our old language. Sara and Mark: Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language 
Sara: I have never had one executed.  Here are the forms of Annexes that I have used, 1 with the PSA Form (Chase 1/29/98) and the other with the ISMA form. Also I'm sending you some questions that I have asked Kinneman et al in the past. Carol 
Tana: I have asked Suzanne to reserve the following dates for the big conference room on 30 for our upcoming lunch seminars:  Friday, May 5th, Thursday, May 25th and Friday, June 16th.  Sara and I are going to try and set something up with the weather group for the May 5th date if that works for them.  Can we plan on scheduleing something with the confirms group and the global contracts group for the other 2 dates?  Sara and I need to talk about what to do with the credit group. 
Lucy: We thought that it would be a good idea to meet with the ""weather"" group to introduce ourselves and alos to go over some of the basics, such as procedures for getting confidentiality agreements processed etc.  Could you send me a list of who you think we should include in this meeting and Sara and I will do the rest?  Will a lunch work? 
Sara: Per my voice mail. carol

Kristina, here are the proposed changes to the Assignment Consent Agreement. Our attorney is Carol St. Clair .  Please respond to her (and copy me if via email) with your response to the proposed changes.  She indicated that we are negotiating an amendment to our master with Morgan in order to accommodate this assignment so we will not be executing the Assignment Consent Agreement until Enron and Morgan sign the amendment to our Master with them.   We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of Morgan and MEGA.  She indicated that her revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer how this cutoff date works.  Carol's contact information is below.

Mary and Sara: I spoke with Lech about the Article 9 questions.  He is going to send me some articles that they have written which I will send to you.    He alos confirmed that the cash perfection issue has not changed  under new Article 9 although his view on it was that this type of collateral under the UCC is more like a deposit account than ""money"" which, under common law principles, gets perfected through the exercise of dominion and control over the cash. Under the new Article 9, deposit accounts are covered and the new Article 9 codifies the common law control test.  e alos expressed a view that It may take longer than July 1st for NY to adopt the new Article 9.

David: Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze let's talk first.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Pursuant to our discussion, please find enclosed separate ENA-Mitsui Steel GTC's for physical steel. I have made the requested changes in the following provisions: Clause 1.3 Clause 3.1 Clause 3.2 Clause 4.1 Clause 8 I am also enclosing a redlined version for ease of comparison.  Mark Taylor or Carol St. Clair should be consulted to make any changes to the financial GTC's. 
Rod: Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions: 1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold 2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs. 3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an Event of Default occurs. 4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff rights. What is the next step? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Roderick Nelson/Enron@EUEnronXGate 05/25/2001 09:15 AM 
Rod and Paul: I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setoff language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an answer this morning.

Rod, Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02. Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward. In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following: ? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc ? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how quickly this out-of-the-money position can move ? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or Master ISDA) ? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a Netting Agreement for UK and US financial Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton about the concept as well. Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in setting up a conference call to push this forward. Thanks, Tracy

Tracy: Where does EPMI fit in if we are doing a financial power swap?  Who are the Enron entities that are involved and what contracts are currently in place with the Kaiser entities?  Are we netting overall exposures and using one collateral threshold?  Are we cross defaulting all of the contracts?  What exactly do you want to accomplish with the netting agreement? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Tracy Ngo/ENRON@enronXgate 05/23/2001 06:17 PM 
Carol, West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation (""Kaiser Aluminum"") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (""Kaiser International"") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International which I believe are quite out-of-the-money. Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI? If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as well? If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts. Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June swap, then we'll try for a July swap. Regards, Tracy

Caroline: I have received and reviewed their comments.  On the legal front, they are objecting to the Bermuda law opinion.  We cannot do this without an opinion. If we need to recommend Bermuda counsel to them we can.  On the credit side, for AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP they want to increase the cross default threshold from $1,500,000 to $2,500,000.  Paul, are you okay with this?  I am okay with their other comments. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
Caroline, As I have said from the outset, before we send them an ISDA, we need to obtain from their Bermuda counsel a legal opinion that gives us the assurances that we need that (1) all of the Bermuda transactions have been duly authorized and are enforceable by us against AIG and (2) we have a perfected security interest in any collateral that has been posted by AIG to us.  A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm.  As to point #1, we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process.  As to point #2, we have gotten some comfort from our legal counsel on this but again it is appropriate to have AIG's counsel opine as to this.

Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and were supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit. Therefore, they stayed as Merrill in our books.  Please confirm which are Merrill deals and which are Allegheny.  We will need confirmation after this review with our attorney as to where these deals will be booked. Another question that has arisen is whether Allegheny traders are trading for Merrill Lynch.

Carol, I've just returned to the office after 6 months away, and have discovered that we have not finalized the ISDA documents with Enron, nor the Guaranty. Attached is the file which you emailed to us last year - I'm not sure if there is a more updated version, so perhaps you can confirm. Also, please forward to me Enron's most recent version of Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex, as we have not reviewed that document. On review of the attached file received from you on January 9, 2001, I provide the following comments: Part 3 - delivery of documents, the part requesting Commercial Risks (Party B4s) annual financial statements looks like it needs some clarification. It appears that Enron wants to receive quarterly financials, however we only publish annual statements as a privately held company. Part 5 - Representations - line of business should be removed for Party B. The Guaranty language looks fine with the amendments, so I would suggest that be issued and we can check it off our ""to do"" lists. When we have signed the ISDA Master Agreement and supporting Documents, I will have our General Counsel submit all of the documentation to our Legal Counsel for issuance of the Legal Opinion. I do not foresee any problems in having this issued in a timely fashion. When the minor amendments referenced above have been made, please forward a final, clean draft of the documents to my attention so we can do a final review and issue the documents for signatures. I look forward to hearing from you soon. With kind regards, Laurie Orchard Commercial Risk Capital Markets - ATT00049.txt - 101CTR-BRED.DOC

Sorry I didn't reply to this by return.  So far we have had no feedback re any of the newer schedules but these things take time in Japan from my experience.  I guess we will just have to deal with that feedback when we get it - I think though that after all the work you have done in getting the forms into shape, it should be much easier for me to take the lead when things move forward because we will be dealing with standalone issues. I have not replied to IBJ and am hoping to get to this this week.  If I have any questions, in the first case, if you didn't mind I guess it would be good if I could try them on you.  If this didn't work for any reason, I would of course be able to address them to your successor. Re BTM - you may recall that they insisted that we work from their draft. I need to try and finalize my response to them this week and if I have any questions, would propose that I deal with them as above. By the way has your successor been decided? Finally, I have really appreciated the way you helped me out of the jam and hope that I will be able to repay the favor one day. Good luck with power trading - when our power trading business here finally gets on its feet, who knows, we may work together again. Jane Carol St Clair@ECT 2001/04/24 02:54

Can you give me a feel for where you think things are headed with respect to those counterparties that have been sent our schedules?  I will let you know who my replacement is shortly. It was a pleasure to work with you and hopefully we will get to meet in person sometime soon! Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
Caroline: Please make sure that they know that in addition to the signed confirms, we need the legal opinion.  I'm in meetings after 2 today so try to catch me before then.

Brent/ Carol- before you go to your conference: Brent- can you please send out the doc to SAC- checking on the manager (its just the one fund) but please just leave blank for now. Carol- AIG funds.. I am getting the confirm back..their lawyer has a question.. we will call you with him today.  Hope to get the ISDAs out to them too. 
Sara: The offsite list is still on my list of things to do.  On Montana Power, no draft has been sent.  Please touch base with Tanya as my recollection was that she had a credit issue that needed to be addressed in the draft.  On the swaption, the Exercise date is 6/29 and the confirm requires oral or written notice of its  intent to enter into the transaction, followed up with written confirmation of notice of exercise.  Is there anything that we can or should do ahead of time? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Sara Shackleton 04/30/2001 06:33 PM 
Carol: Have you had a chance to recap our ""offsite"" discussion? Also, what can you tell me about Montana Power Company (1st draft ISDA)? Stop by in the a.m regarding exercise of your swaption.  What does your confirm say about the form of notice of exercise and the exercise date (or period)?

No. 79 Tuesday April 24, 2001	Page A-33 ISSN 1523-567X Regulation, Law & Economics BankruptcyDaschle Says Bankruptcy Reform Stuck As Party Roles in Conference Still in Limbo Bankruptcy legislation (S. 420/H.R. 333) that separately passed the Senate and House earlier this spring remains in limbo, as the Senate still cannot agree on how to proceed to conference with the House, Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters April 23. The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in conference, while Republicans oppose it. Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions. ""There has been no resolution yet,"" Daschle said. ""I would say that I think both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until

Mary, Sara and Brent: Mark H. has asked me to join Elizabeth's group which I have agreed to do while I continue to support Julia's group on the physical trading side.  I plan to meet with Mark T. later this week to go over what files I will keep and what files I will not keep.  My tentative plan is to finish all of the day to day stuff and to hand over most of the special projects/ longer term stuff.  With that in mind, please give some thought about who should handle the hedge fund work, Canada back-up, the KCS VPP, coordinating our offsite and the remaining legal/credit conferences, negotiating the Japan ISDA's (I have created the forms and drafts of Schedules have been sent out), point person for EIM financial trading issues, and credit derivatives back-up and let me know what you think.

Carol, Your Hedge Fund Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, April 24 at 10:00 am in EB38C2. 
Sara: Please coordinate with Kaye on this.  She has access to my schedule.  I think that she set something up alraedy with you, me Brent and Paul. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Sara Shackleton 04/19/01 04:37 PM 
Carol: Regarding a ""hedge fund meeting"" next week, I have spoken with most of the likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend: Fred Lagrasta Caroline Abramo Robyn Zivic Russell Dyk you Brent me I believe that we have a mushrooming ""process"" issue.  I also believe that the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations are that all hedge funds need not be ""last minute"" deals, Caroline can be our ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering. Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

Paul: Please confirm that the credit terms for the AIG ISDA drafts are the same as the credit terms that we used in the Deemed ISDA. -same independent amount language -no collateral thresholds -same cross default thresholds -existing Enron Guaranty will remain in place -same Additional Termination Events for AIG with no cure; no additional termination events for ENA Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Chris: Thanks for your prompt response.  I think that we do need to register the charge document which in this case would be the confirmation that will be executed. Can you provide me with an estimate of the total cost? Does everyone at Enron agree? Caroline, I will redraft the Bermuda confirm to change from LC's to cash and send to you.  Please make sure that the counterparty is aware that we plan to register/file the confirm in Bermuda.

Christopher: We have done a trade with a Bermuda hedge fund and have negotiated collateral provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  The agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law.  We need your advice on how to perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we would hold in an account in the United States.  Could you please call either me or Sara Shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can send me an e-mail if that is easier.  I'm hoping that our possession of the cash is enough.  Sorry for the short fuse on this.  If you need any additional information, please contact me or Sara.  I will be unavailable from 9-11 and 2-3 tomorrow Houston time.

Joe and Kim: Sara and  I met with Tanya yesterday and one of the topics that we discussed was making sure that someone was tracking whether our counterparties were signing Omnibus Confirms that had credit terms (i.e. Annex B and B-1).  Can you tell us whether there are any counterparties that aren't signing this type of confirm?  Because collateral is involved, from a legal standpoint, the only way that we may be able to enforce our rights vis a vis the counterparty and/or other creditors is if we can demonstrate that our counterparty entered into a valid security agreement with us.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

Caroline Abramo has initiated a new hedge fund family for financial trading. I am anticipating up to 4 separate masters, but likely only one series of negotiations (the others will likely duplicate the terms of the first one). The paper has started flow in.  Would you please advise which attorney will handle this?  The group is Wexford.  I need to start forwarding up to you copies of the offering memoranda. Thanks. 
Sara: In the unlikely event taht you are called tomorrow and they can't reach me here is where things stand.  After several internal discussions with Paul, Akasha and Denis O'Connell and based on the information that we have received from DB thus far, it appears as if our Reference Entity's subsidiaries have declared a standstill/moratorium with respect to all of their debt.  Our Reference Entity is the Guarantor of such debt.  We have taken the position that since the Credit Event must occur with respect to our Reference Entity, we need proof that our Reference Entity has repudiated its obligations under its Guaranty.  We feel fairly certain that it has, but DB has not shown us any proof of this.  Paul is calling the paying agent on the defaulted bonds to try and find out and we have sent another e-mail to DB requesting proof. All of the other requirements have been met with respect to the obligations that DB plans to deliver to us next week to settle the contract.  I just need to quickly review the Guaranty that supports such obligations to make sure that it is unconditional.  I expect to see it sometime today. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Akasha: I would reword the first sentence as follows: In response to your e-mail dated March 21st and based on all of the information that we have received from you thus far which essentially has only demonstrated that the debt of our Reference Entity's affiliates has been repudiated, we still lack proof of the repudiation by our Reference Entity (and the guarantor of such debt) of its obligations under the Guaranty that supports such debt.  Please provide us such information to demonstrate that a Credit Event has occurred. I will be out of the office tomorrow but will be checking my voice mail.  If you need to consult with someone right away, please contact Sara Shackleton who is familiar with this deal. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Akasha R Bibb@ENRON 03/22/2001 12:39 PM 
Carol, can you check the note below. Thanks Akasha In response to your email dated March 21st, you have not proven whereby the guarantor( ie. the reference entity) has repudiated its obligations under the guarantee for the obligations mentioned in the documents sent to us, in your notice of Publicly Available Information.. We are still awaiting a copy of the Prospectus for the ISIN XS0109296011 US$22.4MM floating rate notes due 2000 and a copy of the guarantee.  Again, we do not believe a Credit Event has yet ocurred. Regards, 
Elizabeth: I had a question about a recurring provision that I have seen in your Power Contracts.  Looks like our credit group accepts a Guaranty from a Counterparty's Credit Support Provider as a form of Performance Assurance to satisfy any collateral posting requirements.  On the financial side, Guarantys always supplement the colateral requirements such that we require them to post cash or LC's to us even if we are holding a parent Guaranty. Why is there a different approach on the power side?  Alos, how does credit value a parent guaranty?  For example, if the parent's financial condition worsens, does the value of the Guaranty drop?  Let me know what you think. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Elizabeth, Per my voice mail here is what credit wants to explore.  If we have an ISDA in place with a non-regulated affiliate of a utility, they want to create some credit triggers that would be based on events that occur with respect to our counterparty's regulated utility affiliate.  Can this be done?  Could we, for example, have a drop in the credit rating of the utility trigger a MAC? Could we cross default to the utility's physical and/or financial transactions?  I know that there are limitations on what can be done, I just didn't know how extensive they were. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Akasha: As we discussed, the following are my questions: 1. We need some verification that the debt that is referred to in the articles is the debt of Asia Pulp & Paper Co. Ltd. (""Asia Ltd.""), the entity referred to in the Confirm and that the amount that is the subject of the standstill is at least 10 million. 2. We need to confirm that the debt that is the subject of the standstill meets the following characteristics: - it is a bond or a loan - it ranks pari passu with other senior, unsecured debt of Asia Ltd. - it is not payable in the currency of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized - it is not governed by the law of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
The steel group is considering doing a physical and financial transaction with a Mexican counterparty.  Are there any limitations that I should be aware of with respect to the derivative transaction? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Peter: Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I was not aware of your previous discussions.  In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge. Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post cash collateral to us? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Peter Keohane 03/20/2001 09:58 AM 
In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely unknowingly). Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA. Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account. In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of, and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue. Peter.

Peter and Greg: One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

Mr. Giordano: At Caroline Abramo's request, I am sending you the confirms for the 14 transactions that ENA has done with ENA.  Each of these confirms is the same for each of the 2 Catequil entities except for the specific terms which are set forth on the first few pages.  The last 2 documents that I have attached are the templates that we used to create each confirm.  If you have any questions, please call Caroline Abramo.  Thank you.

Sara: I have reviewed Tanya's list and of the ones that she told us to pursue, it appears as if from our Lotus Notes entries that we are in fact  in the process of getting ISDA's put in place.  That leaves us with Fred's customers (other than Cross Timbers which we are getting an ISDA in place).  Any thoughts on how we should proceed?  Should we focus on the remaining counterparties on Joe's list or others?  Please advise. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Sara: I just wanted to finally congratulate you on your well-deserved promotion to AGC!  I am really, really happy for you, as you are one of the primary reasons why I have chosen to stay in this group.  I would like to take you out to lunch to celebrate and will ask Suzanne to get in touch with Kay to get a date that is good for both of us.  Again, congrats on a tremendous accomplishment.

Does anyone have any comments to the chnages that I've marked on the Schedule to the Collateral Support Annex?  Please call me or e-mail me if you do so that we can implement them soon. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Sara: Just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics: 1.  credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define the ""materially weaker"" standard.  Alos, I'm wondering how credit monitors mergers in general. 2.  additional termination events - when does credit consider additional events like change of control, MAC, chnages to partnership agreement or structure etc. 3.  minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the threshold 4.  threshold amount - what triggers makes it reduce to zero 5.  enforcement of collateral remedies - going over the timetable for enforcing our remedies when a counterparty fails to post and the different cure periods. 6.  letter of credit bank qualifications - confirming with credit that these are still current 7.  cash collateral in Canada Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Sara Shackleton 02/20/2001 09:47 AM

Jaime: Just wanted to update you on the call that I had this morning with Jose and Pablo.  As a general matter, I think that we are going to be okay with offering physical and financial derivative products to Mexican counterparties online.  They are in the process of reviewing the online documents and will get back to me sometime next week with any thoughts or recommendations.  One area that we will need to be careful in is in how we market Enron Online for there are restrictions in connection with the offering of ""securities"". While it is fairly clear that commodity based derivatives are not securities there may be other products where it is not so clear cut.  I think that it would be very helpful if you would send to Jose and Pablo the Online materials (i.e, brochures etc.) that we would plan to send to prospective counterparties so that we can make sure that our marketing efforts don't violate any restrictions taht we would be subject to.

Tanya: Some of the people in your group may not be aware of the latest forms that we use for the Enron Guaranty, the Counterparty Guaranty and the letter of credit form that we use for the ISDA, Omnibus, Industrial Master and Deemed ISDA forms.  enclosed are those forms.  We will discuss them with the group tomorrow, but could you circulate them to the group?  Alos, in light of all of the counterparty visits taht are occurring, should we send to the group a form of confidentiality agreement taht they can send to the counterparty? The practice lately has been for us to see the counterparty form and our preference would be to use our form.  Let me know what you think. Carol 
Sara: I am really looking forward to seeing you and Mary next week.  Bill has jury duty on Tuesday and I'm assuming that he will not be picked.  I'll let you know if we need to reschedule.  I am doing well and so are the boys.  I played tennis with Elizabeth Sager yesterday and got caught up a little bit on what has been going on but it looks like things have changed alot since my departure.  How are things with you, both personally and professionally?  How is the group doing?  I'm having lunch with Mark T. the week after next at which time I hope to get a better idea of what his plans are for me should I return to work next year.  Drop me an e-mail if you can and see you next week. Carol 
Sara and Mary: Here are some dates in the next 2 weeks that work for me for lunch: Next week - Monday, Wednesday and Friday Week of November 13th - Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Let me know what works for you.  Look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Sara and Mary: Could we get together for lunch sometime soon so you can update me on what has been happening at the office?  Let me know which dates work best for you in the next few weeks.  My mother in law is coming for a visit next week so can we shoot for sometime the week of November 6th?  Look forward to hearing from you.  Charles is doing great.  Growing like a weed and becoming more interactive with us.  While I miss the office routine, I am really enjoying my time away from the office.

Enclosed is a draft of a form of Amendment Agreement that revises the setoff language in the Financial Master Agreement.  Please note that these rights are only trigerred upon the occurrence of an Early Termination Date which is consistent with our form.  Should these rights be expanded? 
Joe: Let me check the Williams Master concerning this. 
Tanya: We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel.  Just a few questions for you: 1. Threshold amounts for both of us are $7,500,000.  For some reason, they gave themselves a $15,000,000 threshold. 2. I am assuming that we want a MAC trigger that will bring the threshold to zero.  Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-? 3. For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P or A3 by Moody's.  Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings? 4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000? 
Mark: Thiat sounds right but I would have Leslie take a look at it.  all of this work is in connection with the deal that we inherited from Lou and it all should be allocated to whatever group Bill Windle and Gauarav Babbar are  a part of.

I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.  This included around 23 hours by PB Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).  Does that sound right to you?  I have to allocate this to the business units - should it all go to East Power Trading?

Suzanne: Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift. Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone. Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I would very much like to see them if they want to stop by. I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it? I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet (which I know you will). As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty (and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do. Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by for a visit.

Carol, I received an invoice from LeBoeuf Lamb regarding the ACE insurance matter.  What should be done with it?

Morgan Stanley Is someone from our group working on this? 
Morgan Stanley Tana, Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is working on this. I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all questions to Mark. Could you let me know if you have any info? Thx, Tracyh

Luke: I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that ""The Guaranty of Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed thereunder.""

Luke: Here are my comments to the form of Guranty: 1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement. 2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M if the Guaranty only covers Engage US. 3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only be on the Guarantor's right to assign. 4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent. 5. For notice purposes to ENA please add the following: Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Luke.Mickum@EngageEnergy.com 07/10/2000 10:47 AM

Tana: Here is where things stand on Engage: 1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the Engage Canada financial transactions. I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed. 
Russell: I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney which he never responded to. Tana, Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast. The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to you.

Hi Carol, Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like to know what outstanding issues we have with the Engage US and Canada ISDA amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up. Hope all is well, Russell 
I have not heard anything about this either. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Mark Taylor 08/04/00 09:26 AM 
It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard of Jerry Peskuchi. Tana Jones 08/04/2000 09:16 AM 
Anyone know anything about this? 
Everybody, Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the status of the master. Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling this and pass the info on. 
Tanya: I just received a revised draft of the ISDA Schedule.  There is just 1 point that I want to raise with you.  You may recall that in Credit Event Upon Merger we created a special exception for them in connection with their upcoming reorg which stated that either the transferee or its Credit Support Provider would have to have a Credit Rating of BBB- or better OR Baa3 or better.  They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to the ""transfer"" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the other party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee provides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.  Are you okay with this as a general carve out for all types of transfers?  Our typical language is that we can withhold our consent unless the transferee provides a satisfactory guaranty to us. 
Sara: We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue. You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke). Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day. (1)  On a ""swap"" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held in a U.S. account). (2)  On a ""credit"" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up 
Suzanne: FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there. Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to do as much as I could before I left. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you as much notice as possible. 
Russell: I have sent to Mary and Tana the issues that need to be resolved on these 2 amendments.  They are minor but need a lawyer's attention and Mary will coordinate with Luke M. and Suzi on this. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Russell Diamond 08/09/00 10:05 AM 
Mary, Per my voice mail to you, I am updating you on the status of the ISDA's we have sent to Engage: 1) Engage Energy US, LP: I spoke to Luke Mickum, the legal person at Engage US (713-877-7446), this morning.  He is looking into what issues need to be reviewed/discussed. According to Carol there are no open issues.  If that is the case can we send executed copy's of the ISDA to him for signature.  Before it is sent off, we need to make sure the correct changes have been made to the Credit Annex, as the credit support provider has changed from my original credit worksheet.  I am not sure if Carol had made those changes in her drafts. 2) Engage Energy Canada, LP According to the Lotus Notes Database, the draft amendment of this contract was also sent to Luke, although he is the US lawyer.  A draft needs to be sent to the Canadian Lawyer, Suzzi Sethi 403-297-0348.  She sent us a draft guaranty for review with the guarantor West Coast Gas Inc.  This counterparty is the new guarantor for Engage Canada and the ISDA Credt Annex needs to be updated accordingly.  Once again, we need to make sure the Credit information is still correct in the original draft.  I have given a copy of the guaranty to Tana, can you please review this and provide your comments to Suzzi. Please let me know if you require any additional information. Thank you, Russell Carol St Clair                08/04/2000 11:58 AM 
Russell: I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney which he never responded to. Tana, Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast. The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to you.

Hi Carol, Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like to know what outstanding issues we have with the Engage US and Canada ISDA amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up. Hope all is well, Russell 
Leslie: I received your voice mail.  Can someone fax to me at home a copy of the latest Talisman ETA amendment that Dave F. looked at?  Also, would it be possible to indicate on what you sent to me the parts that Dave F. didn't like?  It would make it easier for me to respond and less time consuming since I don't have much free time during the day but I'm happy to help out. As Mark knows, this was a highly negotiated series of amendments over a long period of time.  My hope is that we can work through Dave's concerns without having to retrade what we had agreed to on the legal side.  My fax number here is 281-890-8862.

Suzanne: Thanks.  I'll call or write back later as my free time is up!  Everything is going well.  I hope to be up for a visit maybe sometime next week. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Suzanne Adams 08/09/00 11:06 AM 
I've already asked Joya to give me a firm date when she knew something because I was going on vacation.  Don't worry about it, I'll take care of everything.  I have to fine out where to send your things first.  I wonder when they'll be moving me?  Got any idea?  No one has said a word to me about it at all.  It'll get done, don't worry about a thing. How's everything going? Carol St Clair 08/09/2000 10:57 AM 
Suzanne: FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there. Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to do as much as I could before I left. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you as much notice as possible. Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet? 
Suzanne: That's a trick question which I will not answer!!  I have been getting as much sleep as Charles will let me for short periods of time.  It's really not too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.  I'm still breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formula so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the house for lunch most of the time.  I'm still running/walking in the mornings and with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.  I just can't stay in the house all day and night.  Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.  He has really shown an interest in tennis and i hope it continues.  I hope to get back on the court in a few weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements. Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are sick of each other.  Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more. Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if I can find a time that works.  I'll let you know.  I'm really sorry to hear about Jim Grace's baby.  Please keep me posted.  It makes me appreciate more what we have.

Ann: I will do that.  Just to clarify, he will need to sign off on all of the changes, which I hope I can walk him through.  The only language that I am concerned about is what I have marked as ""under review"".  I will copy you on what i send to him as I will edit your draft to make my changes.  I will be leaving to go on maternity leave shortly (probably no later than July 14th) and if for some reason we don't conclude this, Mark Taylor will handle (713-853-7459) Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com ""Love, Anne"" <ALove@talisman-energy.com> 07/05/2000 03:54 PM

Hi everyone. I have volunteered as a campaigner for the United Way here at ENRON because I wanted to give-back to the organization that was instrumental in my father's comfort during his hospice.  I hope that you  will join me in achieving Ken Lay's goal of 100% participation by Wednesday, August 23. ENRON has created a home page making it very convenient to make a pledge. Please take a FEW minutes and visit http://unitedway.enron.com to make your confidential pledge. If you experience any problems entering the system please contact me at X57373 immediately.  We are in the process of ironing out a 'glitche' or two. Remember, No gift is too small. Thank your for your consideration. 
Suzanne: Thanks. Sara and Susan: If any of my ""window"" files need to be put other than in boxes, please advise Suzanne. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Suzanne Adams 08/17/00 10:24 AM 
I understand there is an email out, which I haven't received, telling us that the people will be moving back into their offices tomorrow.  The next phase will start next week.  People have to be out of their offices by August 23rd.  That'll work out perfectly!  I'll have you packed up and hopefully somewhere to put everything.  I've ordered boxes and packing bubbles for your photographs.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll get a memo.  He must have put it on the slowest possible method of getting to us. Jim Grace came in yesterday, but I didn't say anything to him.  Dan, of course, had to say ""how's it going"" or something like that. Everything is fine here I guess.  I can't think of anything to report.  How are you doing? 
suzanne: Could you please print these out for me on Monday? Carol 
Suzanne: Please send it to the house.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com Suzanne Adams 08/21/00 09:50 AM 
I don't know what's going on!  I keep hearing different days.  I've got a voice mail into Mark Taylor now.  I wish they would hurry up and get their act straightened out. You've got an Ansel Adams photograph up here with a card.  Must be a gift. Do you want it up here or at home.  It's wonderful.  Are you familiar with Ansel Adams?  He took black and white photographs of Yosemite in California. This probably cost a pretty penny.  I'll take if if you don't want it.  haha Carol St Clair 08/18/2000 10:04 AM

Mark, Kristina, and Carol, In the past few months (before Carol went on maturity leave) I have been communicating with Carol on possible positions available at Enron.  Due to the Moratorium that was in place here at Azurix, unfortunately, I could not speak to anyone at Enron in reference to possible employment opportunities. The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your area or of possible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is detail oriented and possess strong analytical,  communication and interpersonal skills and proficient when it comes to ethical and professional responsibilities within the corporate arena. Thank you for reviewing my resume and I hope to be speaking to each of you in the future.  Many thanks, Barb

Julia: I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches. Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes it alot easier for me since we can trade off. Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected. He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel very, very fortunate. How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him while he is in school. I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope to see you soon.  Take care. 
Mark, Julia and Kristina: We are planning to have Charles baptized on Sunday, September 24th and are having a luncheon at our house afterwards from 12-2.  My parents and younger sister will be in town and I would love for you to be able to meet them as well as see Charles of course.  I will be mailing invitations shortly, but thought that I would give you some advanced notice.  Don't worry if you can't make it as there will be plenty more opportunities to see Charles and of course you are always welcome to come out to the house for a visit.  Take care and see you soon I hope.

Carol - I would really like to come but unfortunately I will be leaving on vacation (to France) on the 20th and won't be back until October.  I hear you will be at the offsite but is there any chance we'll get a visit up here before then? 
David: I would like for Mark Taylor to make the call on the consequential damages issue.  In the meantime, I will check on Utilicorp.

Suzanne: Please mail me my paycheck when you get a chance.    I'm glad that you had a great vacation.  We are doing well.  I've joined some tennis leagues at the club that we belong to and they are alot of fun.  Feel free to stop by some time this weekend if you are in the neighborhood.  We will be around most of the weekend.  Charles is doing great and so are the rest of the family. thank God Bill is home with me.  He is a big help as is Arthur.  Hope to see you soon.

Hi Carol, I have your paycheck here, but nothing else.  Do you want me to just send it alone or wait. I know you have it automatically deposited.  Did you get the picture ok?  How did you like it?  Ric bought me one while we were in CA (not like yours, but a limited edition).  Those puppies cost $250!  That was a nice deal toy. How's everything going?  We had a great time in CA, ate and drank our way through the wine country.  That's about all my news. You did get my thank you note for my birthday present didn't you?  Thanks again!

PLEASE FORWARD YOUR SHIRT SIZE TO ME (S, M, L, XL, ETC.) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, BUT NO LATER THAN FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2000. THANK YOU!!!! 
Elizabeth: Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.  Can you give me your home number?  I think that weekends would be easier to schedule since weekdays are still fairly hectic.  I'll call you soon.  How about this heat?  Fortunately, I've been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad. I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to maternity leave.  Tonight should be great.  I hope one of the Williams' gets beat.  talk to you soon.

Hi Carol! Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime (hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write. See you soon Elizabeth 713 853 6349

The story below from today's Daily Bankruptcy Review describes efforts to ""jump-start"" bankruptcy legislation in the current Congressional session, particularly with respect to the financial contracts provisions of the bill. (See attached file: Bankruptcy Legislation News.doc) 
Kristina: I'm thrilled that you are coming.  I'll e-mail you directions soon and I can't wait to see you.  I'm doing well.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot of tennis (word spread at our club that i was home during the day) and with Bill home we pretty much just ""tag- team"" it with Charles  and the club provides babysitting services which we sometimes use.  This has been a great outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time. Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.  As for Charles, he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.  I have stopped breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better particularly at night.  He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm starting to get more sleep which is nice. Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.  Bill is usually here and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.  I've thought about coming up to the office a few times but  with Bill's schedule, Arthur's tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.  Hopefully I'll get up there soon although I must sound like a broken record by now.  Hope you are doing well and I look forward to seeing you soon, as well as having you meet my parents and sister and of course see Charles again.  Talk to you soon.

Carol- Just got the invitation- had been wondering how you were doing.  I plan on attending.  Could I trouble you for directions?? Call just to let me know how you are doing... I am leary of calling the house b/c you may have just gotten Charles or yourself down for a nap and the phone rings! Kristina 
Sara: Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want. How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing? I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are having fun. Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he ever wants to play some tennis, please call us. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)
