Please see item 8 of the attached GTC.  When the outside party does not provide the Gas from an alternate source or fails to take the Gas to an alternate market, such event is a default allowing us to collect damages for non-performance.  No different than any of our standard Enfolio contracts. The current language in our GISB form gets us to the same result. Eric Bass 12/06/2000 01:36 PM 
Dan, Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring outside parties to honor contracts if they claim ""force majeure""? Thanks, Eric x3-0977

Please forward this to whoever in the Pipeline group does transport, especially Oasis, and I disagree that it should be HPL cause most of the things off Oasis are ENA and will continue to be. 
Dan, ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines (listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.

Janet, Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by ""Greenhouse requirements""?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm desk using a standard    GTC confirm. Janet H Wallis 12/12/2000 09:17 AM

Barbara, This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have any thoughts.

""ENA Upstream"" to Support Wellhead Desk Business MEETING Confirmation: 
Sandi, As you know, I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue.  I believe that George Weismann needs to give us an updated list of contracts that currently exist together with a list of contracts that need to be put in place to match the ENA contracts that ENA now intends to keep, but HPL also wants.  The assignment issue has gotten very complicated.  I think that ENA wants us to enter into new contracts with the counterparties.  I do not think that there are any ENA contracts which need to be assigned to HPL.  There are certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company, these being the contracts with Entex, etc., after we decide how ENA also wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably need a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done. Sandi M Braband 03/07/2001 09:30 AM 
Dan, I am preparing the assignments of ENA contracts going into Lodisco as well as those going to HPL. The PSA at exhibit 4.13 (x) lists those going to Lodisco. Is that still accurate? If not, can you forward to me an updated list? Also, is there a list of those ENA contracts that are to be assigned to HPL rather than Lodisco? Let me know-- Thanks, Sandi 
A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately supported with additional credit documentation, i.e., a letter of credit or a increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee.

THE NEW NEWLYWEDGAME submitted by MeanBabaJean This couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out into town and party with his old buddies, so he says to his new wife, ""Honey, I'll be right back...""? ""Where are you going Coochy Cooh...?"" asked the wife.? ""I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face. I'm going to have a beer.""? The wife says to him, ""You want a beer my love?"" Then she opens the door to the refrigerator and shows him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.? The husband doesn't know what to do, and the only thing that he can think of saying is, ""Yes, Honey Pie...but the bar you know...the frozen glass...""? He didn't get to finish the sentence, when the wife interrupts him by saying,""You want a frozen glass Puppy Face?"" She takes a mug out of the freezer so frozen that she was getting chills holding it.? The husband, looking a bit pale, says, ""Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long I'll be right back. I promise. OK?""? ""You want hors d'oeuvres Pookie Pooh?"" She opens the oven and takes out 15 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.? ""But Sweetie, Honey...at the bar...you know...the swearing, the dirty words and all that. ..""? ""You want dirty words Cutie Pie?..HERE, DRINK YOUR F*****G BEER IN YOUR FROZEN F*****G MUG AND EAT YOUR F*****G SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING 
A small boy walks into his mother's room and catches her topless. ""Mummy, Mummy, what are those?"" he says pointing to her breasts.

Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes into the kitchen. ""Mummy, mummy, Aunt Eliza is dying!"" ""What do you mean?"" says his mother.""Well she's out in the garden shed, lying on the floor with both of her balloons out. Dad's trying to blow themup for her and she keeps yelling,

Grant, I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items: 1. I have deleted the word ""DRAFT"". 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the contract would be executed by the City. 3. I have changed the word ""may"" to ""shall"". 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an omission. 5. I have added the word ""reasonable"". 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be necessary to attain closure. 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure. 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any month. 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate rating applies to ENA.

Kim, Please review this draft.  I have not modified any language from the Enfolio to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded to me last week.  I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to include their language.  Remember, in their short form, they had language for short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture, we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show them what we got for the default quantity. 
Kim, What is meant by a ""new review of this agreement""?  Have they reviewed the master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit requirements into the standard agreement? I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc. Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not signed, no agreement. Let's discuss where we go from here. Kim Ward 03/12/2001 05:17 PM 
Dan, This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their language. Thanks, Kim

Michael, Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document. 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company. I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3). 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas requirements, then no buyback would be applicable. 3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you requested. 
Michael, 
Janet, I have changed the attached for ENA.  Please let me know if you need anything further. Janet H Wallis 03/09/2001 10:58 AM 
I would like to make the name Enron North America because this will be the contract I expect to trade on after the sale.  Thanks 
Mark, I have made the changes noted in the fax which you sent to Jeff.  If the contract is acceptable, please print off 2 originals and have them signed and forward to Jeff for signature by ENA.  Once the contract is finally executed, Jeff will return one fully executed original to you for your files. 
Susan, That is correct.  If ENA wants to trade with Coral, It will need to use its Firm GTC and document accordingly until a new contract is negotiated with Coral. Susan Elledge@ENRON 03/13/2001 01:48 PM 
Hi Dan, I have a copy of a letter dated 8/2/99 from ECT to Coral Energy Resources, L.P. assigning the referenced contract to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The assignment was never made in Global Contracts. If you agree that it should have been assigned, as the letter says, I will assign it today.  If I do assign it, Coral will no longer have a firm master contract for trading.  I will also have to remove it from EOL. Please advise at your earliest convenience. Thanks! Susan 5-9989 
Ed, I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for the counterparty.  I need the Deal Person to initial the contract before an officer will sign.  If I send it to Scott Neal or one of the other desk heads, they will want the deal person to initial before they sign. Therefore, I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this counterparty.  I am holding the contract for that person.  If it is someone on the HPL desk, then we have to start over because you requested that the contract be done in ENA's name. 
Please see attached,  I am not familiar with this agreement? Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp. Legal Department 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 dperlin@enron.com Phone 713-853-7658 Fax  713-646-3490

Kim, The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as attached. Kim Ward 03/13/2001 05:54 PM 
DAN, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE PALO ALTO RFP THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF CONCERN IN SUBMITTING A RESPONSE?  I WILL BE SUBMITTING MY PROPOSAL TOMARROW EVENING. THANKS, KIM 
Travis, Peter Keohane was the attorney who was working with PG&E to put a contract in place similar to what ENA agreed to.  I have not seen any amendments proposed by PG&E, did they get omitted from my email?  I am attaching the proposed amendment which I had forwarded to PG&E last year to enable them to trade on Enron Online. Please let me know if you need anything further. Travis McCullough 03/13/2001 07:25 PM 
PG&E made a proposal to John Lavorato and Bill Bradford today to secure some additional gas supplies from ENA and Enron Canada.  I am faxing a copy of the presentation and relevant documents to each of you.  I think that this is a deal that we are interested in looking at. John and Jim, I think the only question we will have for you immediately are the bankruptcy implications associated with the advance payments.  PG&E claims there are none (of course). Dan, since you reviewed the original PG&E (Core) Master Agreement, can you review the proposed amendments to that Master? Mark -- I don't think Enron Canada is a party to the PGE Master.  Can you take a look at the form ENA executed and see if there is any reason why Enron Canada couldn't execute the same form? Note that PG&E also wants to be re-established to trade on EnronOnline.  I understand the only impediment to that is that the masters need to be amended to provide that Enron, not PG&E, is the confirming party, and that we were on our way to documenting those amendments when this all blew up a few months ago.  Dan, can you resurrect those amendments so we can see if we can weave them into these amendments?

Please generate a GISB for Jared using the attached.  Let's discuss their addendum.  I don't think we will use it.  Let's get a copy of our current interruptible agreement so that we can see what has been previously agreed to. 
Dan, ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly. Jared 35823 
Jared, As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776. Thank you! Michelle - GISB SPECIAL PROVISIONS.doc - GISB-FGU.doc

The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company. The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these assets for them.  Repricing should work. Call me if you have any further questions. Kim Ward 03/14/2001 04:09 PM 
No - that is wierd. Let's try again. Dan J Hyvl 03/14/2001 02:08 PM

You need to save this joke for use with the new Enron password requirements. Becky Spencer 03/14/2001 05:17 PM 
Can you believe it's 5:15 p.m. and I finally had time to read your joke? AND, because it's the end of the day, and this joke being what it is, I can't make my mouth work to read this out loud! Good one! Dan J Hyvl 03/14/2001 08:45 AM 
NEW LANGUAGE -Submitted by PATRICIA L GOONETILLEKE The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will be the official language of the EU rather than German which was the other possibility. As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5 year phase-in plan that would be known as ""Euro-English"". In the first year, ""s"" will replace the soft ""c"". Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard ""c"" will be dropped in favour of the""k"". This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter. There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year,?when the troublesome ""ph"" will be replaced with ""f"". This will make words like ""fotograf"" 20% shorter. In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be ekspekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent ""e""s in the language is disgraseful, and they should go away. 
John, I believe that the schedule is self explanatory and no letter needs to be provided. John M Singer@ENRON 03/13/2001 01:49 PM 
As you are aware, Franklin Adkins has removeed his meters from ENA effective February 1, 2001.  Mr. Adkins has a fixed price, firm deal with ENA  for 13,000 Dth/month @ $3.075.  The term is 4/1/00 through 3/31/01.  Mr. Adkins has breached his contract with ENA by pulling his meters 2 months before the end of the contract. Attached you will find a schedule calculating what we owe Mr. Adkins for January 2001 Actuals, LESS the contractual commitments for February and March 2001. Should a letter as well as this schedule be sent to Mr. Adkins explaining that ENA is reducing his January payment by the February and March commitment?  If so, would you write the letter? John 
Darren, I left this in my email inbox for some reason.  It is my recollection that we talked about this and I asked you to have them make the changes they were requesting to make to their form and send us a final executed document.  Is that correct? Darren Vanek/ENRON@enronXgate 03/06/2001 12:37 PM 
Clement, Please review the attached Guaranty as I have modified same.   If acceptable in your view, please proceed with execution.  Thank you for your patience.

My time is my own.  I make efficient use of it, and I still have no time for reading novels.  If you are inquiring about time that I may have been out of the office during the two week period ending today, I was out on Vacation one day, that being March 9, 2001.  Any questions? Becky Spencer 03/16/2001 11:24 AM 
I need your time for the pay period 3-1 through 3-15 by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday (the 15th).  Please reply to this e-mail with any time exceptions such as vacation, sick, personal, jury duty, etc.  Basically, any time not working! Thank you!

Kim, I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If we need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the version that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for this years 
I am waiting on your response to my voice mail regarding the assignment to BP.  Shouldn't we break the confirm into two documents, covering 42% of the entitlements to Crestar and 58% to BP. Grant Oh 03/19/2001 01:33 PM 
Dan, following up on the status of the contract. Thanks Grant 
Grant, The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can discuss. Grant Oh 03/19/2001 05:16 PM 
Keyspan/Crestar would like to execute the existing contract as is - and work on the assignment ot BP separately. Thanks Grant Dan J Hyvl 03/19/2001 04:17 PM

Lee, Here is the Force Majeure letter to Reynolds.  I know nothing about the Union Carbide letter. Lee L Papayoti 03/20/2001 09:08 AM 
Here's a draft of what we need to send to Equistar .... Do you have hardcopies of two past force majeure letters .... Reynolds Metals ......  back in 1995 or 1996 Union Carbide ..... last year at Seadrift Thanks Lee 
Texas City Facility - The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be strained.  Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron and Dominion Resources in early 1998.  Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000 MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the facility.  After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were terminated.  At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in volumes.  Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts invoiced were correct.  Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.  These notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force majeure.  When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking valves, etc. Clear Lake Facility - The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to deliveries at this facility.  This may be because the contract covering the base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was negotiated by ENA in 1995.  Midcon remains connected to the facility and delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.  Market priced gas is required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes supplied under the 1995 agreement.  Should the power purchase agreement be amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery points.  Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S pipeline.  It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not. 
Debra, I have looked over the cancelled GISB that CES tried to put in place with FGU.  Nothing in there of note.  Therefore, please prepare our standard GISB, do not use any of their language.  When it is ready, please email to Michelle Klein and to Jared Kaiser . 
Dan, ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly. Jared 35823 
Jared, As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776. Thank you! Michelle - GISB SPECIAL PROVISIONS.doc - GISB-FGU.doc 
Jared, The CES GISB was never entered into between CES and FGU.  I have reviewed their requested special provisions and they do not make any sense.  Why should we pay the 5 days before they pay us if we are each selling to the other, the imbalance provisions works the way it is set up in the GISB and their language does not.  Theirs attempts to roll defaults and imbalances together and those are two separate concepts.  As such I have instructed Debra to prepare our standard GISB with our standard special provisions and forward same to Michelle and yourself.  If you have any questions please call me and we can discuss. Jared Kaiser 03/14/2001 02:31 PM

Grant, Attached are the two transactions that result from spliting the original deal.  Please advise Crestar that they need to revise the assignment document to reflect an agreement for Transaction No. 1 dated March 22, 2001 instead of March 5, 2001 and they should provide for a complete assignment of that Transaction No. 1. Document 2001-23acrfm relates to Transaction No. 1.  Don't you agree?  If you agree, please print off 2 originals each and send one of each to Crestar, and email a copy of each to Bob Bowen for his Confirm Records. This to remain     This to be assign- with Crestar.     able by Crestar. Grant Oh 03/21/2001 03:28 PM 
Dan, Gulf/Keyspan have agreed to the two separate documents without a specific contract number. Please prepare and send up to me There is one revision to the volumes, they are  11,740  and 8260     rather than 11600 and 8400 Thanks Grant PS - have you read the assignment agreement and if so, do you anticipate any issues?

Jim, I will work on the Transaction Agreement which will go with the Master Sales Contract.  I just go a voice mail from Credit indicating who was working on your deal.  I am waiting for a credit worksheet from them so that I can start on the Contract.  Once the contract is completed, I will prepare the Transaction Agreement.  I will need to talk with you cause I noted several omissions in the language.  Under certain conditions, the transporter will not allow the over supplier to resell the volumes, they may be merely cashed out.  Do you agree.  What is the Purchase Index?  Is it Inside FERC Henry Hub first of the month  or is it some other index or is it daily.  Let's discuss.  I will be here today and next week.  Friday is iffy. Jim Homco 03/22/2001 01:42 PM

Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  ""(b) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to

Michael, I have reviewed the attached agreement and offer the following comments. 1.

Paragraph No. 5.  Please delete the last two sentences, this had some applicability when the agreement was intended to be a partial assignment, however, once the assignment is completed, Assignee will be responsible for making its own nominations each day. 3. Paragraph No. 8.  Please limit this paragraph solely to Assignor and Assignee, otherwise change the reference to the State of Texas. Please call if you have any questions.

Walter, I do not think that they reviewed the language with their legal group.  They just did a cut of the revised document we sent to them.  As cut the language makes no sense.  Their is no connection between the Financial Statements and the Confidential Information.    Additionally their is no term.  As redrafted, the document is totally unacceptable.  Please tell them we need to go back to the Enron response document which we previously provided.  Thank you. Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate 03/26/2001 03:29 PM

Kim, The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the weekend period.  Just questions to consider.

Dave, I have taken your word file that you forwarded to Travis McCullough and merged it into the Amendment that I had previously forwarded.  The only item that needs explanation is your comment concerning Paragraph 11.4.  The signed version of the contract that was provided after signature by Charlotte goes directly from the SDP language to paragraph 11.5.  As such I would like the language inserted that you indicate is already in the contract.  I agree that the language was in the versions prior to the final version.  Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you have any questions.  If not, please have PG&E sign two copies and forward to me.  I will have them signed by ENA and will return a fully executed original for your files.

Linda, It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL sale to AEP. Linda S Bryan 03/27/2001 02:06 PM 
Dan, Has this all been taken care of through the assignments from HPL to ENA? Please let me know if there is anything that Global Contracts needs to do. Thanks, Linda 
If ENA has a contract with Dynegy that the East Desk is using currently, then that contract will not be going with HPL.  If ENA is currently doing business with Dynegy in Texas, then the Texs Desk of ENA should be using the same contract as the East Desk of ENA is using. David Baumbach 04/02/2001 12:31 PM 
Just for my own knowledge ... does Texas need to negotiate contracts or do we have contracts that cover all activity no matter what region.  For example, if Dynegy currently does business with our East desk, does Texas need a separate contract or do we use the same contract? Dave Dan J Hyvl 04/02/2001 11:30 AM

Deirdre, A red line provided by Kim Decell is attached at the end of this email. Without getting into the language specifics which need to be addressed, the areas of concern relate to Transaction formation procedure (verbal versus signed agreement), Nominated Quantity and Maximum Daily Quantity is used interchangeably when the term most likely should be Daily Contract Quantity or Minimum Daily Quantity.  Term Purchase Quantity is used which means that a default cannot occur until the end of the term when there is no longer any time left for the buyer to be able to request the necessary quantities (default to be determined by using the last day(s) of term prices eventhough default may have occurred on the front end of transaction), Provides for fixed prices without obligation of any fixed volumes, Point of Sale and Point of Receipt needs to be made the same, Limitation of Liability and Responsibility for Taxes need to be changed to Enron language, Triggering Events needs to be expanded to fit Enron concepts, No free walks for regulatory risks, force majeure needs to address Enron concepts, corporate guaranty needs to be payment not performance, collateral threshold needs to be reinserted and updated by Credit for Master verses one-off language. 
Janet, Please review the attached to see that it conforms with your deal.  If so, 
Dave, I have attached Exhibit ""B"" to the above amendment draft.  Please let me know if you need anything further. 
Dan, Please review the attached and call me if you feel that we should incorporate some of the other items which Yates requested in the next draft. I have enclosed a red-lined version showing changes and a clean copy of each agreement. 
My last communication with Monica's attorney was that he was satisfied with our responses to his request and that he was going to run the contract through other groups at the city and would get back to us.  I can insert the last wording change in the previous draft that I had provided to the parties if you think that will speed up their attorney's signoff. Attached is the final version of the contract.  Please feel free to forward it to Monica.  If they are agreeable, please have them accept the red-line changes, print 2 originals, sign and forward to Enron for final execution. Kim Ward 04/02/2001 05:33 PM 
Dan, What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will forward to Monica? Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday? Thanks, Kim 
Kim, We currently have a Master with Eastern New Mexico Natural Gas Association, Inc. (Contract No. 96009607) therefor, the Confirm Desk can do the confirm once it is put in the system. Ellen, Do you agree? Kim Ward 04/03/2001 09:40 AM 
Dan, Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that are fixed will not include TW transport charges. Thanks again, Kim ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into the system?

Janet, Please review the attached amendment to see if it sets forth your understanding of the pricing to be applicable with regard to the first volumes to be delivered during the July - June time period.

This is good.  I need to try it. 
This is HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pat Radford Enron North America Corp. EB3869 713-853-9282 
Dave, As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for the applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is the Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant delivery point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore, please finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for execution by Enron. ""Anderson, David W (Law)"" <DWA3@pge.com> 04/03/2001 01:54 PM 
Please send the executed amendments to me at the below address and I will have them signed and return one original to your attention.: Daniel J. Hyvl P. O. Box 1188, Suite 3878 Houston, Texas 77251-1188 ""Anderson, David W (Law)"" <DWA3@pge.com> 04/03/2001 05:43 PM

Gary, Please review the attached confirms.  if the appear in order, please send to the counterparty. 
Grant, I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order, please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signature by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available to handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of incumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a fully executed contract for your files. Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties. Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such failure.  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make their receipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled volumes.    I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that the OFO provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I

Mike, We have struck out on finding any agreement with the named entities. Did you forward a copy of the complaint to Richard Sanders, if not please forward to either Richard or to me and I will get it to Richard.  Maybe their is something in the complaint which will aid us in determining how ECT is paying on this deal which we have been unable to identify so far.  Dan 
How about White Investment or Peoples Petroleum?  Thanks Dan J Hyvl @ ECT 05/11/99 05:44 PM 
Mike, Jeff has forwarded your request to me.  A search of our data base has failed to identify the named wells or any contracts with the named individuals.  Can you provide any other information?

I thought that we were each faxing our signature pages.  I sent Enron's earlier, however, I have yet to receive any signature pages from the other entities.  Please fax to Dan Hyvl at (713) 646-3490. ""Voinorosky, Michelle L"" <voinorml@bp.com> 04/09/2001 11:49 AM 
Phil DeMoes asked if we could put together a contract with these folks.  I was going done the route of the master because he thought that they would want to buy from us and sell to their commercial customers.  In reviewing the attached information, they appear to be doing something more intuned to putting the parties together.  Is this similar to the deals that Travis and Mark Greenberg are working on and if so, should I forward to them? 
George, I am not sure what language Jeff had proposed; however, I would note that 5 years from disclosure is too long.  I would suggest that the period be shortened 3 years from the date of  the agreement or 2 years from disclosure.  The choice of law as New Jersey is also a problem, I would prefer Texas or New York.  Also, the correct name for ENA is Enron North America Corp.  Please let me know how you want to respond to their draft of the document. Enron North America Corp.

I believe that the Crestar deal is almost finalized.  According to my records, Transaction Number NV8176/370753 was partially documeted with a GTC confirm (2000-087crfm.doc attached) dated January 4, 2001.  This covers a firm sale of 21,100 MMBtu by Crestar to ENA for the period November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001.  The remainder of Transaction Number NV8176/370753 has been documented with two GTC confirms (2001-023crfm.doc and 2001-023acrfm.doc also attached) dated March 22, 2001 (Revised). 2001-023crfm covers the firm sale of 0 - 8,260 MMBtu per day for the period November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001 and 2001-023acrfm covers the firm sale of 0 -11,740 MMBtu per day, also for the period November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001.  By assignment agreement (Crestar assignment.doc attached) dated effective as of April 1, 2001, Crestar assigned 2001-023acrfm to BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp. Ellen Wallumrod has requested that documentation be provided to her to enable her to rebook the portion documented by 2001-023acrfm for the period 4/01/01 - 10/31/01 as a result of the assignment.  Please provide Ellen with the necessary paperwork or forward to the party who needs to provide her with the necessary paperwork. 
Janet, Please review the attached to verify that I have made all of the changes. 
Mark, Please review the attachments from Phil DeMoes and let me know if this is something similar to what you have been doing for ENA at other locations.  If so, can you let Phil know what you think about the attachments. 
Ellen, I have generated the attached for Kim Ward.  I will let you know if the counterparty elects to sign. Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 04/03/2001 11:16 AM 
Dan, As the confirmation will have so much special language and conditions and it is a long-term trade,  I would prefer if someone in Legal wrote it up. Would that be OK Dan ? Regards, Ellen Dan J Hyvl@ECT 04/03/2001 10:02 AM 
Kim, We currently have a Master with Eastern New Mexico Natural Gas Association, Inc. (Contract No. 96009607) therefor, the Confirm Desk can do the confirm once it is put in the system. Ellen, Do you agree? Kim Ward 04/03/2001 09:40 AM 
Dan, Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that are fixed will not include TW transport charges. Thanks again, Kim ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into the system? Dan J Hyvl 04/02/2001 08:55 AM 
Kim, I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions. 
Dan, Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard you!!  This one should be easy. Thanks, Kim

Phil, I forwarded your email concerning enermetrix to mark greenberg, who is our inhouse expert on these type transactions.  Please call him for his read of their document. Phil DeMoes@ENRON 04/16/2001 11:19 AM 
Dan, Enermetrix will be matching us up with the Buyers.  We would have the right to perform a credit check and turn around in 48 hours however we should know the counterparty before we submit a bid.  This would be for both gas and power.  Additionally, the agreement that I sent to you was already negotiated by EES and has concessions in it that can speed up the process. Lets discuss. 
Phil, I have reviewed the confirmation letter and have made several small changes.  I believe that I sent you hard copies, however, if you don't receive them, please print two of the attached. 
darren, This was done as a signed GTC transaction.  I do not know if they have signed or not.  The paperwork provides a zero collateral threshold.  The counterparty is a limited partnership.  J. E. Robert Companies is the general partner.  The enron counterparty is Houston Pipe Line Company.  I see no reason to redo the paperwork if the original GTC has been signed.  Do you agree?

Charlie, Please review the attached letter agreement to see if it conforms with your understanding of the processing arrangement that you intend to have with Hunt.  If so let me know and I will remove the red-lining. 
Ellen, Okay to send GTC confirm with attached GTC terms; however, please delete the conflicting price on the attachment.  the attachment should be Month and Monthly Volume.  Delete Price from attachment.  Don't you agree? Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 04/18/2001 09:23 AM 
Dan, Please take a look a this GTC  -  it is for one year  -  is it OK to go out ? Rgds, Ellen x54099 
Joan, Attached is the Letter Agreement for St. Mary's Production LLC.  According to Charlie, St. Mary's production is being delivered at the same points as is the Hunt Southern Louisiana production.  Therefore, the St. Mary's letter is identical to the Hunt letter which Charlie is sending to Hunt today.  If this is not the case, please let me know and I will modify to fit the terms of the St. Mary's deal.  Otherwise, please print off as many originals as you need and send them to St. Mary's for their execution and return.  Please call if you have any questions. 
Anthony, Why GTC.  We have a new master that is in the system thay was signed within the last 3 weeks.  Put the transaction under the new master.  Any questions, call me!!!!

JEA has verbally agreed to the concept.  If they are fine with these commercial terms the next step will be to turn in into an executable contract. Thanks for your assistance, - Mike 
Charlie, I have modified both documents based on Joan's comments.  I trust that you will get them distributed to the proper parties.

Phil, Attached please find the first draft of the proposed confidentiality agreement between ena and midcoast.  Please read paragraph 7 together with the definition of Proposed Transaction in the first paragraph to determine if you think the language is sufficient to cover us. 
Forwarded as requested.  I will check with Gary regarding the status.  At the time that I sent this I was informed that they were ready to sign. 
Michael, Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document. 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company. I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3). 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas requirements, then no buyback would be applicable. 3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you requested. 
Forwarded as we discussed.  Likewise, I will check with Gary regarding the status. 
Gary, Please review the foregoing to see if it is your understanding of the deal. We have no documentation from Shell Chemical Company to evidence their assignment of the contract to Shell Chemical L.P., so I have left the Transaction under Shell Chemical Company.

Arthur Davidson, of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, died and went to heaven.  At the gates, St.  Peter told Arthur, ""Since you've such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is, you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven."" Arthur thought about it for a minute and then said, ""I want to hang out with God."" St.  Peter took Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God.  Arthur then asked God, ""Hey,aren't you the inventor of woman?"" God said, ""Ah, yes."" ""Well,"" said Arthur,""professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in your invention. 1.  There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusion. 2.  It chatters constantly at high speeds. 3.  Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much. 4.

A jeweler watched as a huge truck pulled up in front of his store. The back came down and an elephant walked out. It broke one of the windows with its tusk and then, using its trunk like a vacuum cleaner sucked up all of the jewelry. The elephant then got back in the truck and it disappeared out of sight. When the jeweler finally regained his senses he called the police. The detectives came and he told them his story. ""Could you describe the elephant?"" the cop asked. ""An elephant is an elephant,"" he replied. ""You've seen one you've seen them

Teresa, I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for the period ending April 30, 2001.

Grant, I do not think that their new language will work in the way they think it will.  What Bruce indicated to me was that if they determined that they had volumes after 9:00 they would offer to us.  If we didn't accept, then they wanted the right to go to another market which might be in the Chicage area. My understanding of this deal was that we were only obligated to take volumes if they were nominated before 9:00.  Is that correct?  Please call me so that we can discuss. 
Dan, after talking to Mike Kleiner from Gulf and Grant Oh we determined the wording in the contract handcuffs Crestar to move volumes after 9:00am MST if additional volumes become available that Crestar did not have prior to 9:00am MST. Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option to move gas after 9:00am. Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the subject agreement. Thanks, ------ Bruce Kohrs Phone: (403)205-7684 Fax: (403)266-1947 e-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001 We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the subject agreement. The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize all of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS to deliver those additional volumes. If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of this letter provided for that purpose. ------ Bruce Kohrs Phone: (403)205-7684 Fax: (403)266-1947 e-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com

Teresa, I think that the problem is what is meant by ""these costs"".  Currently we think that it will be negative, but until we get the allocations, we won't know.  That is the reason we want to go monthly.  Is there a problem getting them to sign something if we need to do it for another month.  The terms may be different with regard to next months deal.

CHOOSING A NEW  BATHING SUIT Apparently a true e-mail a woman wrote to  her friend after shopping for a bathing suit. I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the 1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and they did a good job. Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands. What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch material. The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash. I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared! Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a while to  find the other. At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump. I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap. As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, ""Oh There you are!"" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so sure and asked what else she had to show me. I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day. I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them. Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and bulge  friendly, so I bought it. When I got home, I read the  label which said ""Material may become transparent in water."" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just

Confirmations are only done under trading type master contracts.  That does not apply to the current contract with Haldor.

Health Tips and News The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise: Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this true? A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap. Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables? A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily allowance of vegetable slop. Q: Is beer or wine bad for me? A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories= : animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables. Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio? A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc. Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to ""spot"" for him while he did the bench press. What did he mean? A: ""Spotting"" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin= d that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t= o reevaluate your exercise program. Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis= e program? A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No Pain. Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer? A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time. Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you? A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for you? Q: What's the secret to healthy eating? A: Thicker gravy. Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle? A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul= d only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach. I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had. =7F <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> Shawn Shafai IT Project Manager, Global Extranet Management Cisco Systems, Inc.

Dave, I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I have a number of questions. 1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB. 2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction. 3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for such non scheduled excess volumes? Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the transaction agreement. Dave Fuller 04/29/2001 12:14 PM

Lavonne and I  visited with Mom Sunday afternoon.  We cooked outside and had a great time.  Mom said that she might want to fix noodle soup on Mothers Day.  That would be great.  We can supplement with sausage or hamburgers on the grill.  What do you think.  Mom's memory appears to be good about many things, and then some things just don't seem to register.  She seemed confused about whether Bettye had been their for Easter.  Is this normal, what type of medication is the doctor having her take to combat the loss of memory?

Dan, Please take a look at the attached deal confirmed on GTC  -  is it OK to go out ? Rgds, Ellen x54099 
Yes,  Let me know if you agree with their breakout of the fee components. 20/15/15.  If so I will change the agreement back and incorporate their other changes for comment. Michael J Legler@ENRON 12/20/99 11:17 AM 
Dan, Westport will go along with breaking up the service into field gathering, gathering and compression. Let me know where to go from here. Is this just a matter of changing everything back the way it was with the exception of the Gathering Fee section and responding to their other changes? Mike 303-575-6488

Troy, This is the short form confidentiality agreement that credit uses for financial information. I will send you the standard form for transaction information by separate email. 
Troy, The above is the standard ENA confidentality agreement for transaction 
Mike, Are we sticking with wire transfer as the method for payment?  I assume that we are. Section 5 Pressures -  Is there any need to include the two sentences they proposed at the end of that section?  I assume there is not. I see no need to make any of the changes proposed in Sections 8,  9 & 11. Do you agree? Assuming you are okay with the above I have attached a revised contract both red-line and clean for your review. Michael J Legler@ENRON 12/20/99 02:49 PM 
Dan, The breakout of $0.20 for field gathering, $0.15 for compression plus actual fuel and shrink, and $0.15 for Ft. Union gathering works for me. The last line of Section 2.1 is a problem. We cannnot guarantee a Feb 15. date. I would like to put that we will endeavor to install the facilities as quickly as conditions allow after the required permits are received by Enron . Section 4.2 - I don't agree with 90 days......I would settle on 45 days. In the General Terms and Conditions definitions we need to leave dehydrator fuel and dehydrating terms in under Equivalent Quantities and Gathering. Under Quality the 6% by volume of total inerts must stay. Let me know what you have a problem with. Thanks, Mike Enron North America Corp.

I agree, Sunday was really enjoyable. It was so nice to have all the moms that are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once. Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me know what to bring and I'll be there. In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her into a nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost in tears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attempt to assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her tests and medicines as she needs to. I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account which requires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $500 or $1000..whatever we agree is a ""safe"" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, I feel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs or

Jeff, We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has also assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March 9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, I will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the case? Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for 
Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream. The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have been sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved through arbitration. Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to

Janet, The amendment is effective as of June 1, 2001.  That is the date on which the price changes and the date that the term is extended and the date the meter number is added.

Cheryl, I am the person who asked Debra if she could find the confirms for the deal.  The system indicated that the deals were confirmed in legal and I knew that I had not received a request for any deals covering the time period post of 3/31/99 under that GISB.  If done in legal it should have been by me or Debra.  In any case if a confirm was done, it should have been filed with the confirm desk, and not with the HPL contract.  I apologize for not contacting you directly.  We needed the document immediately and the HPL contract group has already indicated that they did not have it. Cheryl Dudley 05/17/2001 04:20 PM 
I just wanted to let everyone know to please call Amelia Alland (713-571-3271) or myself (713-571-3187) with any issues regarding HPL contracts, deals, etc. We will be very glad to help in any way possible. Stacey Richardson 05/17/2001 04:04 PM 
Debra, The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 (cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the confirm out of Tagg. I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that. Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note: The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have been attached to the GISB. Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end. I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) since it's the only record I could pull up. Sorry I couldn't find you everything! SBR DEBRA PERLINGIERE 05/17/2001 02:30 PM

Read the text before looking at the picture. A class of elementary students started a class project to make a planter to take home and wanted to have a plant in it that was easy to take care of, so it was decided to use cactus plants. The students were given greenware pottery of a clown planter, and they painted them with glaze and had them professionally fired at a class outing so they could see the process. It was  great fun. They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters, and they grew nicely but unfortunately the children were not allowed to take them home. The cactus plants were removed and a small ivy replaced them, and the children were then allowed to take the planters home. The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time....

Brant, EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan.

I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.

THE BLONDE KIDNAPPER A blonde was down on her luck. In order to raise some money, she decided to kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom. She went to the playground, grabbed a kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, ""I've kidnapped you."" She then wrote a note saying, ""I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north side of the playground. Signed, a blonde."" The blonde then pinned the note to the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents. The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting beneath the pecan tree. The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with

They want to trigger a fixed price for about 400 MMBtu/d. Rudwell - we discussed a collateral threshold of $100,000 with this entity, based on the limited information that we have received from this privately held company.  I assume this is still correct? Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL contract for the collateral threshold matter???  It is a typical HPL physical contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and I'll fax it to you. Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing anything. Thanks Lee

Robert, Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use. Robert Rose@ENRON 05/30/2001 03:21 PM 
Dan, I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with language most favorable to HPL. Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable. Thanks!!! r

Here are the latest documents for the assignment from ENA to LODISCO and HPL.  Please note the last sentence in Article 1, concerning those agreements that require consent, for which consent has not yet been granted. Please let me know if these are ok to send to Anthony Wills at V&E. Thanks, 
Robert, I have modified the attached as requested. Robert Rose@ENRON 05/30/2001 03:48 PM 
Dan, Ann Elizabeth prepared an agreement last week whereby Harris County MUD No. 23 would be allowed certain access across HPL Bammel property to do work on their drainage ditches.  After a review of the agreement by Steve Schneider, he suggested that language be added concerning a matting of the property over the pipelines when ""heavy machinery"" is used.  Also, he suggested that language as to property/road restoration be added. Taffy, can you email a copy of the agreement to Dan so he can make these changes (I was only provided hard copies)? Please let me know if you have any questions! Thank you very much, r 
Cathy, At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement utilized by these counterparties.  Although I have no authority to approve them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL, I would approve them for execution. Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get out of balance.  If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services. No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star Pipeline.  The only documents faxed were two transportation services request 
Keith Ford with TXU Fuel Company confirmed to me this morning that TXU had agreed to consent to the assignment of the contracts and that he would fax the signed consent to me as soon as he could get an officer to sign same.  He agreed to send me a letter to that affect in the event he was unable to get a 
Candace, If you look at your purchase document, you will see that you never received the minerals.  Do you agree? Candace L Bywaters 05/31/2001 09:14 AM 
Pls apprise me of your status on the preparation of the bill of sale for the above properties.  Short of a mineral search, we have concluded that we want to reserve the mineral rights, if any, in our agreement with the buyer. I have whatever exhibits you need available for this document.  We would like to have it by June 1 to offer to our buyer. Thanks, Dan. Candy 
Chris, Anne Koehler asked me to email the attached red-line assignment to you for her review and revision.  Please call if you have any questions.  My phone number is (713) 853-6895. 
Stacey Neuweiler asked that I forward this to you so that you could print 2 copies of each document and give them to her boss for signature.  I have reviewed the form of the agreements with Mitch Dutton and agreed that they are these transporter's typical form.  If time would permit, I suggested they negotiate the penalty language, otherwise the forms are okay.  Call me at 713-853-6895 if you have any questions.  I am also forwarding the Duke documents for you to print off and have signed.

Dan, Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this -- I got sent out to the field for most of the day. Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the legal description. Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in perpetuity.  HPL will have the right to abandon the line in place if it so chooses.

Robert, Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use. Robert Rose@ENRON 05/30/2001 03:21 PM 
Dan, I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with language most favorable to HPL. Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable. Thanks!!! r

THE STRONGEST MAN 
As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replace the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call 
I have reviewed the pro-forma May 17, 2000 draft of the Gas Purchase Contract provided to you by the subject party.  The only item that has to be changed is the second sentence of 22.2 relating to venue in Cook County, Illinois. This sentence needs to be deleted.  Enron would prefer to be the confirming party in sections 2.2 and 2.3; however, that is our preference but we can agree to let the other party be the confirming party when necessary.  Please

Does this make sense to you? 
Please reconfirm as necessary. These were all riding on contracts that have been ""assigned"" to AEP/HPL/Lodisco effective 6/1/01. ENA is no longer party to the original agreements. Please note that several of these are EOL transactions. Thank you!

I have again reviewed the master listing which Melissa prepared last Thursday and compared the names thereon to the RRC listing of Investor Owned Companies Filing Annual Reports for calendar year 1997.  Based thereon, the following companies should be excluded from the gas sales agreements being transferred to HPL: City of Brazoria D & H Gas Company, Inc. Empire Pipeline Corp. Entex, a Division of NorAm Energy Corp. Gulf Gas Utilities Company Lone Star Gas Company Markham Gas Corp. Oasis Pipe Line Company Petrofina Gas Pipeline Company Reliant Energy - Entex Southern Union Company  ---- This should be ""Southern  Union Gas Company, a 
I do not think that we can make the determination of which storage or transportation agreements may need to be assigned by refering to the counterparty name.  Each agreement file will need to be reviewed to determine its purpose.  Then depending on its purpose, the agreement will either remain with HPLR, ECT, be terminated or assigned, if permitted.  Therefore, please have the file room pull the agreements and send them to me for my review. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Steve, I concur with your assessment of the proper method of so transferring the documents. 
Dan, I think that given that there was a transfer of gas balances on the books from HPLR to ECT on 2/1/99, we need to show the transfer of the Operative Agreement rights and obligations to ECT first.  We can use the very same form to effect a transfer of ECT's interest on to HPL  effective July 1, 1999, with an acknowledgment of gas balances Schedule that will reflect the changes in each parties balance on July 1, 1999.  I know its more work, but I want it to track reality for when we face any investor/bank inquiries.  Let me know if your thoughts differ. Steve 
Forwarded for your information.  I recall talking with Gregg about this and that we did not intend to use the GISB for anything more than one month.  I think we agreed to let it sit. 
Dan - here are the special provisions that were provided by EnergyUSA.  Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks for your help. Gregg 
Melissa, The maximum rate which HPL is authorized to impose for 311 transportation service may be established by either a rate proceeding before the FERC which would have to be renewed every 3 years or by using the margin component of a city gate rate which has been approved by the state regulatory agency.  In HPL's case, HPL has filed with the FERC that its rates will be the margin component of the City Gate Rate approved in Docket No. 592 before the Texas Railroad Commission.  This allows HPL to use this margin determined as provided in the February 8, 1974 contract between Entex and HPL as its maximum rate for 311 service.  That is one of the reasons that HPL continues to sell certain volumes of gas to Entex under that contract.   You can probably contact Steve VanHooser for any documentation that he may have concerning the applicable FERC filings if Tom Shelton does not already have such information. Please reforward your message to me after the 18th so that I can contact Aquila concerning where we next proceed concerning HPL's contract. mrgraves@aep.com 06/08/2001 09:49 AM 
Dan, Per our phone conversation, please contact Kathy Dirks with Aquila Energy Marketing, Corporation regarding the final negotiations of their master contract.  Per Kathy, this HPL contract has been in negotiations for almost a year, and they are very close to finalizing.  Her phone number is: 816-527-1560. Also, at yesterday's meeting regarding the various AEP Entities, you mentioned that HPL has 311 Transportation with a Grandfathered Rate.  Do you have any documentation regarding this arrangement, or can you refer me to the person that could provide this? Thank you, Melissa Graves 
Robin, At Jeff's request, I have reviewed the attached form which National Fuel provided.  It is not designed to operate as a Trading Contract.  Transactions are only formed by signing an Exhibit A to be prepared by National.  The Exhibit A is to have a Daily Transaction Quantity and National may nominate from 0 to 100% of that quantity each day.  Penalties only arise if the actual quantity deviates from their nominated quantity.  Seller to pay difference between Buyer's replacement price and the Gas Commodity Charge times the deficiency quantity.  Buyer to pay difference between the Gas Commodity Charge and the Daily Midpoint Price times the deficiency quantity.   Does not state what quantity is to be applied against the Gas Demand Charge; however, does state that if Seller has a force majeure the Gas Demand Charge is only applied against the actual volumes that Seller delivers and that the Gas Demand Charge is not reduced if Buyer declares a Force Majeure.  Buyer's payments are to be trued up to the actual quantities delivered should actuals deviate from the nominated quantities. Please note the comments I provided to you last year relating to this counterparty.  All of those comments are applicable to this Contract form.  I have attached that memo for your review. Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this matter. Jeffrey T Hodge 06/08/2001 08:48 AM 
Dan: Could you look at this?  I think we have reviewed it several times before and there should be a file. Thanks Jeff 
Barbara Gray asked me to forward the attached draft of the Back to Back agreement for your review and comments.  This is the agreement contemplated by the letter dated June 1, 2001 relating to the Guadalupe Power Partners L.P. agreement. 
Richard, The GTC is okay to send out for this deal; however, please note the change that must be made to the Delivery Point for this deal.  Call if you have any questions. In the future please advise Barbara Gray of any supply deals at points where an interconnection with HPL is possible, excluding EOL transactions of less than one month. Richard Deming/ENRON@enronXgate 06/07/2001 02:22 PM 
Dan, Please find below details of Phy Gas deals with GTC agreements: 
I am unaware of any physical trading constraints relating to doing business with a cooperative.  We have been doing business with such entities for years.  Can he be more specific about where the restriction is concerning financial trading for a coop. Stacy E Dickson 06/08/2001 03:13 PM 
Do you know the answer to this? 
Stacy, I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to obtain before granting credit to this company? Thanks Darren Vanek Risk Assessment and Control 713-853-1436 
Barbara, Tom Martin called and said it was his understanding that he could buy gas at any EOL point such as Exxon Katy, Waha or Carthage for any term and that he could resell such gas into HPL.  I explained to him that the EOL carve out was for transactions of less than one month.  He asked if you could call him if his understanding was incorrect and then he asked if you wouldn't mind 
Here is the draft as it was Wednesday.  The red-line is the changes to the version supplied by Southern dated June 1. 
Please review the four which I have changed from Enron Company to Houston Pipe Line Company.  Call if you need anything further.  I intend to be over there next Monday.

Greg, Please review my mark-up.  We need to keep the distinction between HPL and GM throughout the document.  Remember GM is the marketing affiliate and HPL is the pipeline.  Call me if you have any questions. 
Candy, My initial reaction to the letter is that we should not commit to do a contract for deed for the buyer.  The buyer needs to obtain financing from another source and take us out completely; otherwise why are we doing it. Another buyer may come along during the interim.  Let's discuss this with Ann Elizabeth next week. clbywaters1@aep.com 06/13/2001 09:41 AM

It wasn't too bad.  The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night.  Lots of sunshine Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday.  I spent some time shopping at Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday afternoon.  I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating.  They were out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way home till I got about a mile from the house.  I also noticed them out yesterday, however, I think they may have aged.  Are you sure that James doesn't have an opening for them.  They seem to be hard workers, at least they go through the motions. Jenny Helton/ENRON@enronXgate 06/13/2001 11:46 AM 
Guess you better send James over to interview them.  They might be willing to relocate. Jenny Helton/ENRON@enronXgate 06/13/2001 01:01 PM

A woman goes to her boyfriend's parents' house for dinner. This is to be her first time meeting the family and she is very nervous. They all sit down and begin eating a fine meal. The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof. Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a

Barbara, This relates to our meeting last Thursday when I asked Brenda if the Entex Gas Marketing transactions stayed with Janet Wallis.  It is my understanding that the Entex traders for both Entex and Entex Gas Marketing are sometimes the same.  I recall times when Janet would request a deal under Entex and then Entex would move the  transaction to Entex Gas Marketing.  They have also gone the other way on some deals. The same is possible with Southern Union Gas Company and Mercado in Galveston and Port Arthur. I raised the question because these may occur at or behind the city gate delivery point. Brenda said that she was going to ask the business group how they wanted to handle Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado. Barbara N Gray 05/26/99 01:49 PM 
dan please explain why you think that the entex gas marketing k and mercad gas services k should remain in ect. 
Are you the steve referred to in item 1.  If so what is the difference between monthly business between Tufco and monthly business with another prohibited party either Lone Star Gas Company or Southern Union Gas Company. There should be no difference. 
I have again reviewed the master listing which Melissa prepared last Thursday and compared the names thereon to the RRC listing of Investor Owned Companies Filing Annual Reports for calendar year 1997.  Based thereon, the following companies should be excluded from the gas sales agreements being transferred to HPL: City of Brazoria D & H Gas Company, Inc. Empire Pipeline Corp. Entex, a Division of NorAm Energy Corp. Gulf Gas Utilities Company Lone Star Gas Company Markham Gas Corp. Oasis Pipe Line Company Petrofina Gas Pipeline Company Reliant Energy - Entex Southern Union Company  ---- This should be ""Southern  Union Gas Company, a

Barbara, I am not sure whether my response was sent or not yesterday.  My Notes Mail crashed every time I tried to send an email.  The reason that I suggested that Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado remain with their affiliated distribution utility is that transactions with these entities are usually behind the city gate, transactions usually bounce between the utility and the marketing entity until a decision is made by the counterparty.  In the past we have documented transactions as being with the marketing entity and Entex has requested that they be with the utility, also the reverse has occurred. However, if the utility will set up different marketing reps to keep the business straight, then we should be okay with moving the marketing to HPL. Barbara N Gray 05/26/99 01:49 PM 
dan please explain why you think that the entex gas marketing k and mercad gas services k should remain in ect.

Paul, You say 5,000/day plus fuel.  The delivery point is in the south texas pool.  Where does the fuel come in and how is it determined?  Also, did we ever determine the name of the Reliant Energy entity that was doing the deal? Paul Burgener@ENRON 09/25/2000 04:45 PM 
Dan, Attached are the details for the enovate transaction(s)/purchases of physical gas from Reliant @ Trunkline Stx pool.  I received your draft of the agreed Master for the 30,000/ day parcel.  Could you draft a form for the 5,000/day parcel winter only.  I need this turned around so I can forward to the Reliant people ASAP.  I also need to forward any changes to the agreement past our partners PEC legals folks. Thanks, If you have any questions please call me at (312) 541-1226 
Paul, Please check with your counterparty at Reliant for the full name of the Reliant Energy entity.  Is it Reliant Energy Gas Resources Corp. or some other name?  I am still confused about the fuel component of the volume.  We probably need to expand on the language in the prior draft to specify the fuel volume for the movement of the gas from the Delivery Point to ___________________.   Have the attached documents been sent to Reliant Energy and if so have we received any comments from them?  I will draft a Transaction Agreement for the latest deal that will be similar to the prior deal. Paul Burgener@ENRON 09/26/2000 10:06 AM 
Dan, The company is Reliant Energy (wholesale trading group) at this point and the fuel is handled the same as the 30,000/d deal that you wrote up. (See attached) thanks, 
Attached is a draft Transaction Agreement for the 5,000/day Winter deal.

Dave, I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B. Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default by either. Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term of our sales transaction with them. 
FYI. 
Attached is the draft letter to TJ Sattler regarding Waha/Henry Hub Spread Trade.  Please review and provide me with any comments. Thanks.

Hello Dan, I'm going to be in Houston next week and I wonder if you might have a few minutes that I could stop by and speak with you about my Kaiser gas deal. Please let me know if there might be a good time on Tuesday or Wednesday. Thanks, Dave Fuller 503-464-3732 Dan J Hyvl 10/10/2000 04:18 PM

Russell, We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan, This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty. Regards, Russell 
Russell, The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and ____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement. Please let me know when you will be available to discuss. Russell Diamond 10/13/2000 10:57 AM 
Dan, I provided all the information that you are asking for on the original credit worksheet I e-mailed to ENA legal on August 29.  You will notice in the comments section the Enron entities I wanted covered in the guaranty along with the Contracts that needed to be reference.  If you need a copy the specific contracts that need to be covered they can be obtained through the documentation group, or through 'Live Link' on our computers.  Please make note of the name change that has now occurred with respect to Engage. Russell Dan J Hyvl 10/13/2000 10:24 AM

Clement, Russell Diamond of the Enron Credit group would like Enron to issue to Engage (now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.) a blanket guarantee covering obligations of ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. without necessarily tying those obligations to specific contracts.  Do you have a form of guaranty that could be used for this.  I think that the guaranty would still have a limit ($25MM)?.  Please advise.

This is in follow-up to the deal transfer matter we discussed this morning. Julie Meyers called me and stated that Tom Martin had called her to put the deal transfer from HPL to ENA on hold till Monday; however, she had already moved them in the system.  I asked her to find out if the deals had been confirmed under HPL and if so, I would need to prepare a document to transfer them from HPL to ENA.  She agreed to send me a list of the deals that had been moved and whether or not they had been documented with the counterparty.  Apparently, they had been and Jennifer Blay has now redocumented two of the deals as ENA deals. 
Attached are the confirmations that went out under HPLC.  Jennifer has reconfirmed Forest Oil under ENA already.  I will followup with you Monday after Tom meets with legal. ,,,, If you have any questions, let me know. Thanks!! Julie

This is to confirm our conversation relating to the Option Agreement.  If EFI is to sign, I believe that the following changes need to be made. 1.  The last sentence of paragraph No. 2 should be deleted.  The agreements provide that EFI has the right to assign to an affiliate without EI's consent.  EFI needs to maintain its right to so assign during the term of the agreements.

Irene, These become HPL contracts on the effective date of the assignment.  As such I would use that date as the effective contract date and the assignment date.  The original contact date can remain the same as in the contract file.  Tom/Steve - Do you agree? Irene Flynn 10/26/2000 12:06 PM 
Dan, to follow up on the phone message I just left for you! In the ongoing process of automating TRRC Sales Tariff Filings,  we have encountered several issues for which we need legal clarification in reference to all the sales contracts that were assigned from ENA Sales to HPL Sales. What date should be filed as the Original Contract Date? What date should be filed as the Contract Effective Date? What date should be used for the Contract Amendment Date - i.e. the assignment date? 
Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP).  She was not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered.  Richard opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost the Taub lawsuit.  This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed.  Richard explained that if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit.  In that event HPL would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property.  Because the Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not 
Chris, The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as 
Please review the attached draft letter for Heartland.  Is the letter to be signed by Bradford or someone else? 
Ed, We have removed the specific examples of Force Majeure as not being needed because the revised 11.2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as of the date hereof, which is not within the reasonable control of the party and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof, all without listing specific types of events which might be considered. You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the preceding sentence.  By example, assuming that more than one transporter could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point, if the transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure, the Enron revision would require a party to continue performance by obtaining transportation on another transporter, irrespective of the cost. I trust that this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to call me at (713)853-6895. Jared Kaiser 10/24/2000 08:42 AM 
Dan, Ed Fernandez with The Energy Authority replied to our GISB contract with the following questions.  Could you please address and copy me with your response. Thanks for your help, Jared 
Disregard my question about the arbitration process.    AAA selects 5, Enron/Tea can strike 2 and then AAA can appoint the one arbitrator.   But even after that, Enron/TEA can challenge AAA selection.   In short, we have no problem with Enron's arbitration language. 
Gisb Jared, Our atty suggests we find get clarification on a couple of issues regarding your amendments: Special Provision 11.1:  T GISB is already fairly broad in scope ""...any cause not reasonably withing the control of the party claiming suspension....""  The amendment to 11.2 repeats the same, but removes specific examples. 1. Why are the specific examples removed? 2. Am I correct in presuming that Enron wants to make it clear that Force Majuere cannot be claimed for economic purposes? Special Provision 13.9:  Under the AAA rules, is only one arbitrator selected from the very beginning, or are a few arbitrators selected initially, and then each party can pick and choose until eventually there is only one official arbitrator?   Like a jury selection...sort of. Thanks, Ed 
Based on Stacy's comments yesterday, I have changed the last sentence of 11.1.  Her comment was that the last sentence of 11.1 said events of force majeure may inclucde and 11.2 said events of force majeure shall include. Now they both say shall however I have tied it to the preceding sentence of 11.1.

Not with all of their changes.  We were going back to our original language relating to representations and implied warranties.  Otherwise, I believe that their language only deleted reference to a Texas law designed to protect individuals from big business making improper warranties, i.e. triple damages for little guy, big guy only gets his damages.

Russell, Please review the attached draft of the draft Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement which has been drafted based on Exxon's comments as necessary changes before they will allow the Mobil plant to schedule gas under the terms of the October 1, 1995 Agreement.  I have merely incorporated the credit language that was used in the October 1, 1995 agreement into this agreement and have attempted to make the other changes that Exxon was requesting.  Question, is the parent company still Mobil Corp. for the purposes of the MAC.  Do you still agree with the prior credit requirements as provided in the October 1, 1995 agreement, and if not, please provide me with your updated requirements as early as possible this morning so that I can incorporate into the agreement prior to presenting it to them for further negotiation later today. Lee, Please review the attached so that we can discuss which of their changes have been made, which we did not make and the reasons therefor.  The quick points being:  sentence at end of 2.3 which takes the place of their items 1-4; $0.15 to $0.05 in 3.2 and 3.4; item (iii) in 4.2 per their request #5 except I changes 30 business days to simply 30 days; I did not give them their request #6 except I did incorporate the last two sentences of their request; I attempted to give them all of their requested #7 except I reworded slightly for balance and the items we previously discussed; did not do request #8 because we will incorporate that in the Transaction Agreement; gave them their request #9, gave them their request #10 except I left in the ""as is, where is"" and the line they omitted when they retyped; did not do their item #11, added section 8.9 for termination of prior agreement; added their items #12 and #13 but modified as we discussed; otherwise I updated the contract and changed references for Buyer's Transporter to simply Company. Anything else? 
Dave, I am still waiting on the Credit Worksheet so that I can draft the agreement.  The Houston credit group claims that they have no request for this.  Please verify with the Credit Group so that  they would provide a credit worksheet directly to me for use in preparation of the contract. Otherwise, let me know how your negotiations on the transactions components is proceeding. Dave Fuller 10/18/2000 04:43 PM

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates. The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be in the contract file.  Do you agree? Irene Flynn 10/27/2000 02:49 PM 
Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report without a tariff number. Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC Tariff Filing Report.. Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs sales tariff for period after assignment. Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under the transport tariff for this transport imbalance. Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then HPL needs to file a sales tariff. Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract (Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing. Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm. Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99 Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99 Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99 Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99. Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL. I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen by Monday October 30 so she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 and 31a4. Thanks for all your help!

Again, 
Gerald, Please comment on section 1.6 of the attached document.  I am concerned that we might be on the hook for a reimbursement for periods beyond the Term.  Can this happen?  If so, is the language in the second attachment sufficient? 
Can you add or attach the attachment that you refer to in your note to Jeff Hodge. 
Dan: As you know I will be in London next week .  Could you work with Barry to get this finalized.  It sound to me like all that needs to be done is print the document and put your initials on it.  There is also an index confirm to prepare. Jeff 
Jeff, I understand that Stacey is on maternity leave.  This confirm is long over due. I have been working with Stacey to get it done. The attached document in it's finished state is what the customer and I have agreed to . Can you please have someone finalize the document and send back down to me for signatures. Barry PS. I also need the daily index confirm and we will clean it up also. BT 
Stacey,  please find attached the completed marked up GTC that we need to finalize and re-submit to Crestar. TO DO:    I have added a line in part 3 ( blue).  Add this section .  Either add in other terms that section 2 and 5 are not applicable for just delete them.. my preference is to just exclude them in the other terms piece rather than delete completely. This will complete the monthy volumes confirm for Crestar. Make these changes and send back to me today. Thanks. OTHER:  Please e-mail to me the latest version of the AOS balancing confirm and I will add changes that we went through. Call me if you have any questions but we are almost there... PS.  we must get this done now because as of Nov. 6 Crestar loses some of their staff and I don't want to start over on this process with new people. 
Barry, Item 2 of the attached document states that Section 8 does not apply to this confirmation.  Why can't we change the language to state that Sections 2, 5 and 8 do not apply to this confirmation.  I would prefer to do this in lieu of changing the standard GTC terms and conditions.  Otherwise, what is meant by the language ""if the replacement price is not representative of the market price, the parties may agree to use a fixed price in lieu of the index price""? Barry Tycholiz 11/03/2000 02:58 PM 
Okay, as to 2,5,8.  Can you explain what is meant by ""fixed price"" in the other and what criteria is to be used in fixing the price? Barry Tycholiz 11/03/2000 03:27 PM 
I agree with you on points 2,5,8.  just delete them in the confirm. With regards to point 2. As long as the language reflects that best efforts are taken to buy/sell gas at Daily Index when required and then it goes to a fixed price I am fine with it. Barry 
Barry, The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please advise. 
I agree, however, I will exercise my right to vote in the morning to 
No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 234-4204. Steven Curlee@ENRON 11/06/2000 02:21 PM 
I just wanted to make sure that you got your problem resolved last Friday. Jessica White, who schedules NGPL, should have given you a call.  I meant to call and check that afternoon to make sure, but got busy on something.  If you would just respond to this email letting me know if everything is resolved, that would be great. Thanks, Steve 
This is to confirm our conversation relating to the Option Agreement.  If EFI is to sign, I believe that the following changes need to be made. 1.  The last sentence of paragraph No. 2 should be deleted.  The agreements provide that EFI has the right to assign to an affiliate without EI's consent.  EFI needs to maintain its right to so assign during the term of the agreements. 
Barry, Can you elaborate on what you are referring to about AOS daily balancing agreement?  Is this something that Stacy Dickson prepared for you?  If so, please attach a copy for my review. Barry Tycholiz 11/06/2000 05:01 PM 
Dan, I will not be sending this document to Crestar.  Raise this confirm directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal. Can you send down the paper on the AOS daily balancing agreement. This is a seperate agreement that is secondary to the firm deal. Thanks. 
Barry Tycholiz says that the attached is in final form and should be Raised directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.

There is a second document that Stacey was working on that is pretty much identical as the Monthly firm deal but involves only gas on Alliance called AOS ( this is like Interuptable gas, but a little different ). The confirms has been raised previously, and you should have this on file. This is the file name on the bottom of Stacey's last document. o:\common\legal\sdickson\agreements\crestarspotcnfm.doc. Let me know... PS . did you send the confirm to Crestar on the firm volumes. BT 
Bob, Can you determine from the attached if we have a current deal to amend, or is this simply a new deal under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.? Please advise. 
Dan, Can you prepare the necessary documents for Formosa.  They accepted proposal A. Thanks, 
Ellen, We need to resend because the trader agreed to some additional modifications after that date. Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 11/07/2000 05:12 PM 
Dan, I've had a look into this, and my system show that Jennifer Blay sent the confirm to the counterparty October 2, after it was revised by Stacy Dickson. I will confirm this with Jennifer in the morning. Would you like a copy of what was sent out ? Regards Ellen Dan J Hyvl@ECT 11/07/2000 08:55 AM

Cheryl, Can you please have someone get me a copy of the Valero deal that expired 10/31/00 so that I can see how we documented that deal.  For all I know, I may have prepared that documentation, however, I can't find a signed document. Cheryl Dudley 11/08/2000 10:36 AM 
Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday: I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term under, but I found the following: There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The confirmation is in Livelink. The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that the File Room doesn't have anything either). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink. There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything else in the File Room). There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa. ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) from Livelink. Please let me know what you want me to do. 
What is the status of the credit worksheet for this counterparty?  Looks as if we need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Please advise? 
Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR). UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of changes/negotiations. Note: UGI is also an EOL ""Investment Grade"" counterparty for non-Texas natual gas. 
Cindy, Thanks for your help. - Claire - ugimaster.doc

Kevin, As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it. 1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 31, 2000. 2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of the essence in this Agreement.. 3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" under the listing applicable to Chicago and using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and receive from Seller for such day. 4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any indemnity provision or otherwise. 5.

Gregg, I talked with Ellen Dailey, Reliant's attorney, yesterday.  Subject to the credit departments approval of the credit items that Reliant copied from the ENA/Reliant proposed contract, the other items in the contract requested by Reliant have been discussed and resolved.  As soon as I hear from Russell 
Russell, I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract.  However, until they sign the master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical guaranty that you currently have from coastal. Russell Diamond 11/10/2000 02:23 PM 
Dan, I have forwarded you the Guaranty from Coastal.  This Guaranty is a redline version that Coastal has provided comments on.  At this time they do not want to negotiate the Master Agreement until they fully understand how their current positions will fit into El Paso's trading book with the upcoming merger.  Please review the attached Guaranty and provide your comments.  The contact ar Coastal is Dai Nguyen, her phone number is 713-418-4229. Thank you, Russell 
Stacy, The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my 
The original Unit Agreement was described as follows: Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.; John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust; Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm. First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year. The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do not have copies of these 2 amendments. At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company. Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you need anything further to describe 
Ellen, Would you mind responding to Barry regarding these confirms.  Thank you. 
Dan,  have we sent the confirm for this deal to Crestar... and what is status of AOS confirm on the daily balancing volumes. 
Ellen, I am attaching a redline and a clean copy of the Enovate/Reliant contract, 2 proposed transactions to be entered under such contract, and a redline and a clean copy of the ENA/Reliant contract.  If these meet with your approval, let me know and I will prepare execution copies for each party to sign. Please note that the credit group made one change to the language in section 4.2. 
I have this date forwarded these three confirmation agreements to Gary Lamphier for his further handling with his counterparties.  I will let you

The new Purchase Agreement looks nonexistent.  Did you intend to attach something for me to review? Kevin Ruscitti 11/13/2000 04:42 PM 
Dan, Please take a look at the new Purchase agreement and let me know what you think. Thanks, Kevin 
Vector. 
They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the contract is signed by ENA.. Kevin Ruscitti 11/14/2000 12:01 PM 
Vector. 
Barbara & Anne, I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however,

Plese extend global contract #96036535      Hays & Company   thru 12/31/2000    and make it month-to-month EVERGREEN. We need this one ASAP -- call me with questions      281-286-7153 
I forwarded a request to Russell for the credit worksheet on 11/08.  No response to date.  I will forward our master to them once I get the credit worksheet. Jeffrey T Hodge 11/16/2000 01:24 PM 
Dan: Please handle this. Jeff 
Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR). UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of changes/negotiations. Note: UGI is also an EOL ""Investment Grade"" counterparty for non-Texas natual gas. 
Cindy, Thanks for your help. - Claire - ugimaster.doc 
Mike, The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as finalization of the price to be applicable.  The contract documents should be in final form and ready for signature.  Please review both documents and let me have your comments. If the documents meet with your approval, please forward to Ami Beard for her review.   I will be in the office all day 
My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests, Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've made a few small changes: Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea. The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas. Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it is a turkey. We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them. They are lying. We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table.  In a separate room.  Next door. Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.  I stress ""private"", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances, enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat. I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that ""passing the rolls"" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance. Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it. Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably 
David, As we discussed, the Note provision of the Contract Price section of the confirm should be deleted.  Since the $3MM is to be paid for all events except for a default by SMC under this confirm or under the confirm for theexisting FPL base load, it would make the document clearer to restate the commodity price without the $0.0126 per MMBtu consideration and add a demand charge provision to cover the payment of such $0.0126 per MMBtu times the DCQ times the days in the month, excluding any default by Seller regarding the sale of volumes destined for delivery to FPL.

Gregg, Here's the status of the Reliant matters. 
Dan, thanks for your submission of all the contracts, I've not been able to devote all of my time to them, but they are in varying stages of completion.  This will be a short week with the holiday, so I wanted to touch base with you and let you know that we probably will not be able to address these contract issues until the week of Nov. 27th. I hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Ellen Dailey 
Attached please find the modified Transaction Agreement which has been revised to reflect the matters you discussed earlier today.  I modified the third item relating to prior approval by Ormet of incremental costs to cover the situation that such transportation or supply becomes unavailable during the period Enron is obtaining Ormet's prior approval. 
Karen, I have reviewed the redline document that Debra Perlingiere spent time on. It is not a finished product and needs a great deal of work.  I will continue to work on it.  Apparently the redlining must have been confusing and I need to start fresh.  I will try to get the redline to you as soon as possible. If we need to put something in place before the contract is executed, maybe we can document the transaction under the existing GISB contract currently in place between the parties and agree that the transaction will be rolled up 
Attached please find a red-line of the changes for the referenced proposal. Please review and let me have your comments.  I had to start from scratch. I limited this to a single transaction as provided in the proposal.  You may recall that you had requested Debra to convert the single proposal into a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement so that it could be utilized by adding future transactions by way of a Confirmation Letter.  The short review time to get something in place will not permit the global changes which may be necessary to cover all the points to make the proposal into a Master.

Danny, Set up a folder on the C-drive called WINZIP and copy each of the attached files into that folder. 
Ellen, I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895. 
Kim, I have reviewed your markup of the redlined contract I forwarded to you last Wednesday.  Since you confirmed that we were merely putting into place a three month contract, we should be able to resolve the issues rather quickly.  If we were working on the Master, I would agree that we are a long way apart.  Let me respond to the changes you put in your last redline. 1. Delete the definition of ""Credit Support Provider"". 2. Add definition as follows:  The term ""Guarantor"" means, as to Seller, Seller's ultimate parent, Enron Corp. 3. Restore the definition of Material Adverse Change to the language as provided in my redline to you.  It is the position of our Credit Department that a rating of BBB- is considered investment grade and as such that is the benchmark below which a material adverse change would be triggered.  Enron Corp. is currently rates as BBB. 4. The changes that you made in 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.1 are okay.  The change that was made to 2.2.2. should be deleted. 5. The change that was made to 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 is okay. 6. The changes that were made in 9.1 should be removed because the sale and purchase quantity is based on the DCQ.   Note that all settlements under the Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to be handled between the party and its transporter. 7. The change in 9.3 should be changed back to five (5) Days instead of 10 Days.  5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries, changing to 10 would mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a payment default. 8. The change in 10.2 of ""at or"" should be restored.  This is a 3 month deal.  Seller's position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or after delivery.  Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal. 9. All of the changes made to 12.2, 12.3 and 12.5 should be removed.  There is no partial force majeure, a party is either unable to perform because of the event or the party can perform.  Please explain how the loss of Buyer's market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not be required to find a new market during such period.  Force Majeure should only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate and collect a Termination Payment. 10.   The change in 14 should be deleted.  There is no event which would allow early termination other than a Triggering Event. 11. Please explain the changes in 16.4.  Seller has provided all of the notice address information that will be put in the Contract.  No telephone number or other address will be added. 12. All of the changes made to 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 and 17.4 should be deleted and the original language provided in my previous redline should be restored.  These are requirements set forth by Enron's credit requirement and are not subject to negotiation by me. 13. I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 nor the addition of 18.4; however, I do not believe that either party would be able to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods. Please reconsider. 14. The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I would forward same to Enron Corp. for their consideration. Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me have your comments so that we can get this finalized as soon as possible.

Dan- Attached is a redline document showing our counter to your redline proposal. The majority of your changes were fine, from my perspective, with minor tweaking (for example, timelines in arbitration).  The two primary items I think we will need to discuss are (1) Taxes and (2) the definition of a Material Adverse Change.  Please see my suggestions and then we can discuss. As part of this discussion, could you please provide Enron North America Corp's and Enron Corp's S&P debt ratings? Please note that any changes we discuss will be subject to the final approval of Wisconsin Public Service. Please provide me with an estimated response time (ie, this afternoon, tomorrow morning), so I can keep WPSC apprised. Thanks for your help! Kim Decell Gas Supply Consulting, Inc.

Janet, I agree with Kyle, however, Ducote indicated that Bruce told him that they wanted it in Entex Gas Marketing Company.  They sent us draft paper for a spot gisb, however, we don't normally put long term firm under the gisb so, I redrafted the transactions under the Master Firm Purchase Sale agreement which they are reviewing.  I recall that Joe Casas called me to say that Entex had some comments concerning the fact that they did not record phone conversations and only wanted us to record the portion of a call that was specific to a deal.  So far, I have not received those comments from Joe. Janet H Wallis 07/30/99 04:04 PM 
Dan, Is Entex Gas Marketing correct?  Ducote said to refer to the GISBY contracts for the proper name (which you may have done). 
Janet, Can you let me know what you find out regarding that $1 million dollar pmt to Entex for extending the deal?  The Transaction Agreement #4 & 5, the buy/sell, nets out to the $1million due Entex.  Since this payment is for extending the deal,  shouldn't the Transaction Agreement  be between ECT & Reliant Energy - Entex and not Entex Gas Marketing? I will be out this afternoon, so could you just email me? Thanks, Kyle 
Ellen, You are correct.  I do not have the information at this time.  Can you execute without the information.  I will get Enovate to fill in the information when I send them the contracts for their signature.    Dan Ellen_R_Dailey@reliantenergy.com 11/29/2000 03:22 PM

Veronica, The credit language is only one of many areas of disagreement between the consultants view of what the contract should look like and our version. Their last response was that the MAC would be triggered if Enron Corp. fell below an A rating.  I informed them that we could not agree because it was my understanding that Enron Corp. was currently rated as BBB.  I will let you know if you need to be involved in the contract negotiation or non-negotiation in the future.  I do not currently have a response from the consultant as to our last position on her nonagreement to make the necessary changes so that we could agree to document the 3month deal. Veronica Espinoza@ENRON 12/01/2000 02:30 PM 
Dan, I've looked through the contract (at least the credit terms).  Of course I prefer to keep our credit language w/ the mac language of ratings decline.  I am not too familiar w/ the transaction itself.  I simply feel that if it truly is just a 3 month transaction, we may not need to 1) argue this much further and add special language to a confirm 2) issue out a $10MM gty (or if we do make it valid for only the three month term as it ties to the contract itself) Please let me know what you think.  The marketer and the counterparty contact on the deal have been calling me for a response. Veronica 
Veronica, Attached is a redline version of the entire contract with Wisconsin Public Service.  It includes all the changes requested by Dan Hyvl.  It has been edited with my counter (i.e. - striking what not acceptable/relevant and providing underlined substitute). One thing I'd like you to consider in your review is the term and scope of this contract.  The contract is for 12/00 - 2/01, 3 months, only. Furthermore, the contract language covers just this transaction - it is NOT the base document for future transactions.  I will begin work with Enron early next year on a Master Contract to cover all future transactions. With that in mind, I'd like to suggest that we remove any reference to a Material Adverse Change.  It is currently a new and unsettling concept to WPS, particularly their Credit Dept.  Given that (1) the contract is short duration and (2) it is extremely unlikely that WPS will fall even to a BBB ratings within this time period, I feel removal of this language would greatly improve the chances of getting a meaningful contract in place quickly (note today is the effective date).  I will work with WPS on this concept for the future Master Contract. I am leaving for lunch but will be back shortly. Thanks for your help with this. Gas Supply Consulting, Inc.

Please see item 8 of the attached GTC.  When the outside party does not provide the Gas from an alternate source or fails to take the Gas to an alternate market, such event is a default allowing us to collect damages for non-performance.  No different than any of our standard Enfolio contracts. The current language in our GISB form gets us to the same result. Eric Bass 12/06/2000 01:36 PM

Hi Stacy - Dick Jenkins has expressed concern with the description of an EnronOnline location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows: The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3. Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the M3.

Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist PQPC.  The amendment has nothing to do with the 1996 letter which was totally superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS. Doug Leach 12/05/2000 08:17 AM 
Why is this necessary when we just executed a reduced price fuel supply contract with PQP LLC and we are in the process of trying to sell the asset and transfer the fuel contract to the new buyer and Glencore?

As you may recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter agreement dated August 12, 1996.

Kim, I am reviewing the changes you made to see if they conform to our discussion.  I understand from your comments in the email that you disagree with the items we discussed and are attempting to go back to the previous language which I indicated would be unacceptable.  As such, I have gone back over the redlined contract and have only commented on the things that differ from our previous agreement.  Please review these and call me in the morning if you feel that your client cannot agree to these changes. 1. The sentence added at the end of 9.1 should be deleted.  Any differences between the DCQ and actual is to be handled between the party and its transporter.  As I explained, if we schedule a DCQ of 10,000 with you and the pipeline and only deliver 9,500 to the pipeline, the pipeline will deliver 10,000 to you and collect the 500 shortfall from us.  Likewise, if we schedule 10,000 with you and the pipeline and you only take 9,500, we still sell you the 10,000 and the 500 you didn't take is between you and your pipeline transporter. 2. 10.3 and 10.4 need to be deleted.  What we agree to say was as follows: ""10.3  Buyer represents that no taxes are applicable at the Point of Sale. In the event such representation is false, then such misrepresentation shall be a Triggering Event allowing Seller to terminate the Contract pursuant to 
Dan, Attached is a redline document which compares our current version to your 11/22 version.  I have summarized our differences below, but I will call you at about 10:30, subject to your calendar, to discuss the items. Significant Differences (1) Taxes I deleted Enron reference to Buyer paying taxes AT the Point of Sale.  I (a) kept our 10.3 but added sentence that ""no taxes currently applicable at POS and (b) added Sec 10.4, which we discussed gives either Party right to terminate contract if they are assessed an unduly burdensome tax. (2) Exceptions to Force Majeure I added ""not otherwise due to an event of force majeure"" to the section addressing failure of reserves/insufficient production from reserves.  This should clarify that if a force majeure event, ie explosion, occurred at Seller's supply point, Seller would NOT be obligated to perform (except as identified in Triggering Events). (3) Billing We cannot accept Enron's requested changes.  It is the industry-standard to bill Buyer's based on what WAS, not what was TO BE, delivered.  If actuals are not available, it is acceptable to bill based on DCQ, but once actuals are available, prior period adjustments would be made to the next invoice. To demand a procedure different than the accepted industry-standard is something that should have been stipulated by Enron at the time the Contract Terms were established in 8/00. Given the tremendous progress we've made to this point, I am hopeful that Enron will accept the industry-standard (billing on actuals) for this contract.  We can address this issue next month when we begin preparation of the future Enron/WPS Master Contract. (4) Credit Terms Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed Enron's Material Adverse Change definition, (b) removed Enron's Sec 17.2(vii) regarded MAC and (c) added back our Section 16.10 Credit Terms, whereby either Party has the right to demand credit support if in their sole and non-discriminatory assessment the other Party might not be able to meet its financial obligations pursuant to the Contract.  Failure to provide credit support is considered a Triggering Event per Enron's language. (5) Effect of Force Majeure Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed language referring to consequences of extended force majeure but revised to refer to Sec 17.2 Triggering Events and (b) added Sec 17.2 (vii) to make extended FM a Triggering Event. (6) Collateral Requirement THIS IS A NEW REQUEST.  I would like to change the Termination Payment threshold from $10MM to $15MM.  In light of soaring gas prices, WPS could find itself owing more than $10MM strictly based on standard, full-performance Accounts Receivable (for example:  15,000 (MDQ) * $10 (gas price) * 60 (days) = $9MM.)  I believe your provision was intended to keep Buyer's from having multi-month A/R and/or non-performance charges. Since I believe we agree WPS is fully capable of meeting its financial obligations, we should not set a threshold below potential standard, full-performance A/R. MINOR ITEMS (1) Throughout document, I made changes to your comments to make consistent with form of entire document, including changing Daily Contract Quantity to DCQ and putting days in words (ie 20 days became twenty (20) days). (2) Deleted Nominated Quantity definition as this term was replaced by DCQ. (3) Other changes that we agreed to yesterday. Dan, please let me know the earliest, convenient time for you to discuss these items with me on the phone. Thanks for your help. Kim Gas Supply Consulting, Inc.

Mike, Attached please find a draft confidentiality agreement which we would propose to use with the financial information required to be provided pursuant to the guaranty.  If acceptable, please print and start execution, we will sign when we receive the other documents.  Sorry for the delay, I had requested this from our credit department and forgot to follow thru. 
Mike, I have reviewed the requested changes to Exhibit D, I am okay with the proposed changes so long as the same changes are made to Exhibit C.  The change to Suspension of performance on Appendix 1 is okay.  The collateral requirement language has been in the contract for some time so I am concerned with bringing up changes at this late date; however, please let me know your concern so that we can resolve the issue with the Enron Credit group. ""Mike Cesario"" <MCesario@ormet.com> 12/08/2000 10:16 AM 
Attached is a copy of Ormet's mark-up to the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement post V.P. of Finance review.  The changes are primarily to Exhibit D. Additionally, there is one chage under Suspension of Performance on Appendix 1 page ""1""-3.  Finally, we need to address the collateral requirment/termination payment threshhold in section 4.3. Thanks, Mike - Enron_Agreement.doc 
Kim, Let's try to get this signed as soon as possible.  The changes are as we discussed.  I will be out Monday, but will be able to approve the final version on Tuesday. ""Kim Decell"" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com> 12/08/2000 05:18 PM

Hi Dan: Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to execution.  However, due to the ""Notices"" section missing from the Enovate contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem. Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling? Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements completed. YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it. Thank you, Ellen 713.207.3266 ellen_r_dailey@reliantenergy.com 
Janet, Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by ""Greenhouse requirements""?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm desk using a standard    GTC confirm.

Ellen, With this added information, can you generate the contemplated confirmation? 
Forget the greenhouse requirements and  just make it requirements up to 50 MMbtu a day.  The meter number is #1598. Also, the GTC method is fine with me. Thanks, J Dan J Hyvl 12/12/2000 09:44 AM

Please confirm that these changes are acceptable. 
Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality agreement.  Please review it and get back to me with your comments. Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement. Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Thanks, Mike - Enron_CA.doc 
Mike, I have checked with the credit group and the suggested changes to the confidentiality agreement and to Exhibit ""C"" and ""D"" are acceptable.  They did point out a typo in the collateral threshold provision.  It should read $1,500,000 instead of $1,5000,000.  Please accept the redlined changes to the documents and make the above correction and the documents should be ready for you to start the execution process.  I am informed that credit will not make any changes of the $1,500,000 collateral threshold amount until they have had an opportunity to review the Ormet financial information.  Thereafter we can work on an amendment if they feel that the financial information warrants making a change. ""Mike Cesario"" <MCesario@ormet.com> 12/12/2000 10:53 AM

Doug, As we discussed, Larry Pardue has requested that I get you to sign an officer's certificate regarding the execution and delivery of the Fuel Supply Agreements.  The document that he forwarded to me does not define the agreements that he wants you to certify as to.  They are vaguely referred to as Transaction Agreements which have been delivered.  As far as I know, he may be wanting a certification as to the Consent documents.  If they get back to me, I will request that they modify the document to reflect the Fuel Supply Agreements only and that you are not aware of any reason why they would not be valid under New York law, that you are not aware of any lawsuit threatened against EPOS as a result of it entering into these Fuel Supply Agreements and that so far as you know, EPOS is not an investment company as such term is defined.  I will let you know what Larry is able to modify. 
Dan, as we discussed, herewith the EPOS Officer's Certificate.  Again, and sorry for the short notice, we need a fax of the Certificate before 11 a.m. this morning, Houston, time, for the closing/funding.  Again, the certificate is being requested from our lawyers, Vinson & Elkins, so that they may release their opinion in connection with the closing.  They must have the Certificate in order to do so.

Kim, I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of comparing the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.  Once I finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to Enron Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will let you know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the deal contact for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know when it has been signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be. If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart execution which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by WPSC. Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A copy should be sufficient. Don't you agree. ""Kim Decell"" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com> 12/15/2000 03:35 PM

Jeff, I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal. She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of default. If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed.

Christian, I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th is not a Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day is a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are open for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it is not a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of Business Day. Therefore that change should not be incorporated.

Here is another incident stemming from the A-S 30 inch pipeline rupture of December 4, 2000.  Although the facts are still being developed, this customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down, HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different source or direction.  This line may have had some liquids settled in the line or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a failure at Ameripol's boiler.  This resulted in a fire which they claim caused equipment and product damages.  Liquids are not identified in the quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor. Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages. Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a result of lost sales due to the inability to produce product.  They have faxed us a written demand or notification which I will forward as soon as I receive it.

Dan, On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which read: ""This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
Kim, Please review the attached confirmation letter to see if it correctly reflects your transaction.  Please call if you have any questions. 
Kim, This appears a little too iffy.  Please get with SCGC to find out the notice period. If it is greater than 10 days then we will change our language to the greater notice period.  If less, we will leave our notice period at 10 days prior to the month.  Please call if you would care to discuss. Kim Ward 01/08/2001 05:01 PM 
Dan, Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get out of the deal, we should add something to this effect - ""subject to the monthly deadline established by Southern California Gas Company for 
Kim, Please review the attached confirmation letter to see if it correctly reflects your transaction.  Please call if you have any questions. 
Grant, The only change of any significance that Anne requested is the deletion of the words ""and Enron confirms the nomination,"" that was previously in the first line of the third paragraph under Other of the Spot Confirmation. Please confirm if this deletion is okay.  If not, please let me know and I will put the words back.  The other changes were form type and did not change 
Monica, Kim Ward asked me to forward the attached general terms and conditions to you for your review.  These general terms and conditions are used in conjunction with a Confirmation Agreement which would be signed by both parties.  The Confirmation Letter sets forth the volumes, delivery point, price terms which are to be applicable for the gas to be sold pursuant to the general terms and conditions. 
Dan, Today, I entered into some conversations with the City of Palo Alto regarding fixing forward gas prices for them.  They have a copy of a Master agreement and a copy of an ISDA which are currently in their legal department.  They have requested a copy of the GTC language which would allow us to transact in the immediate future, although I am still pushing for a Master.  They currently have a Power Master in place with EPMI. Could you forward a copy of the General Terms and Conditions to Monica Padilla with the City of Palo Alto at Monica_Padilla@city.palo-alto.ca.us first thing in the morning?  Please let me know if you have any questions or issues. Thanks, Kim Ward 
The above letter has been modified to reflect that Buyer may terminate by providing notice to Seller at least five days prior to the date established 
Christian, The below documents has been modified in the manner that you suggested. Please make sure that the Purchase Order Number is communicated to all parties in writing prior to the end of the month if it is to be used.  The red line should reflect  the changes that you have  been requesting.  By copy I am requesting Janet Wallis to review the suggested changes and to communicate directly with you if she approves such changes.  If she notifies you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2 originals of the clean document and have it signed by CPS and forward to Janet for signature by ENA.  Do not hesitate to call if you have any questions.   My phone number is (713) 853-6895. 
Gary, Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start work on the request. Gary W Lamphier 01/09/2001 11:13 AM 
Dan, Did we ever send a contract out ot these guys?  I know we discussed it but I bet I never requested a contract.  Let me know. 
Steve, Assuming that the system btu reported annually is representive of the Btu of the gas being purchased, the procedure that you have set forth will work. The question is how is the system btu determined?  Is it a total recap of the measured mcfs including both purchase and transport? Steve -HPL- Schneider 05/10/99 04:28 PM 
Attached is my procedural draft to accounting on how to calculate MCF WACOG. Let me know your comments by the close of business on May 12th. 
Anne, I have incorporated the changes you requested in the above confirmations. We deleted the language ""and Enron confirms the nomination"" in the third paragraph of OTHER in the Spot Confirm and replaced it with ""and Enron receives the notification of the nomination at least 30 minutes prior to the 1st GISB nomination cycle deadline,"". If these are in order, please print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward them to Grand Oh at the Calgary office for his follow-up so that they can be executed by Enron. 
Please generate master for my review.  Thank you. 
Dan & Debra - Attached is a credit worksheet for a Master Firm Purchase/Sale for UGI Utilities.  Please prepare a draft and send to Claire Neri at UGI at your earliest convenience. Thanks, Jay Williams 
FYI if you need any addresses. 
Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR). UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of changes/negotiations. Note: UGI is also an EOL ""Investment Grade"" counterparty for non-Texas natual gas.

Help, Time Warner is my cable service provider, however, when I attempted to open the ordering information, I am told that a discount for TimeWarner cable modern service is not available in my area.  What do I need to do?  So far as I know, I can subscribe to cable modem service with TimeWarner, however, I have been waiting until the ClickAtHome rollout before I committed to any service contract.  Can someone get back to me regarding when the discounted service might be available, if not, what is the possibility for a discounted DSL service from ATT.  Thank you.

Bridgette, To the best of my knowledge, we are not working on a contract with Washington Energy.  Has anyone asked the gas trader assigned to that account about any contract drafts that the gas trader may have received and not forwarded to legal. Bridgette Anderson@ENRON 01/11/2001 09:39 AM 
Jeanne, As I explained to Terry on Monday or Tuesday, according to the notes within Global Contracts database, K#96030149 is an unexecuted contract and it currently has a status of expired .  Because of these factors, we suggested that the deal be re-entered and a GTC attached to it until a contract can be negotiated and executed. Unfortunately Global Contracts database is inoperative this morning so I cannot give you any further information regarding any other notes for that particular K#.  Please let me know if the suggestion that has been made is feasible. Dan- to the best of your knowledge, has there or will there be a contract drafted for Washington Energy? Regards, Bridgette Jeanne Wukasch 01/11/2001 08:53 AM 
Bridgette  -    Please extend global contract #96030149  with Washington Energy.    This deal should be set up as a month-to-month evergreen (see note below from the trader - John Singer.) Thanks. 
So you only email me when you want something.  No, I do not know what I am going to do.  They tell me Time Warner Cable Modem service is not available in my area, however, Time Warner tells me it is.  They tell me that I can sign up for DSL and expense it on my expense account until they allow it sometimes next month.  I guess I need to talk with them some more about which is better.  People tell me the cable modem service is actually faster than the response we currently have in the office.  Let me know what you decide to do, so that I can ponder the reasons for your choice.

FYI----Don't know what happened to my recommendation that they use either an unexecuted agreement notation or call the counterparty from the trading floor on a recorded line. 
Re 1. I don't believe that the traders on 35 are appropriately covered based on what Dan has told me.  Is that a concern?  If so, it is possible to manually change the confirm to fit the situation for the mean time. Re 3.  I understand what Mary is saying, but in these cases that I'm referring to (which I believe are rare), I believe the gas is flowing.  The meter has been turned on and isn't the pipeline accepting the gas?  We are still not nominating the gas, and because we have not put the ticket into the system, we are withholding payment.  Now, from what I understand, client services will make a manual payment, if they are called by the producer. But, for 1 month or even 2 months, we have not made a payment, because client services would not have known to make a payment, therefore, we are still in violation.  It appears the best solution legally, would be not to turn on the meter until the contract is signed.  I'm not sure that is a good business decission though. I know that there are cases where we don't know that the meter is still flowing, or that it has been turned on.  I think the easiest thing would be to make sure that we are covered with a GTC spot, taking out the language of the recorded line. Julie Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Russell, Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are covered by our contracts.  Non contract amounts should not be subject the the guarantee, incoming or outgoing. Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enron entity.  This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's new parent will need to take its place. Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee will not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this takes the action of their spun off entity.

Janet, I have reviewed the attached contract and it gives me a lot of concern. First brush, it is one sided in their favor and offers us no breakage protection.  Specifically, Section 4.4 --- HPL should be the confirming party. Section 4.5 --- HPl also needs to have the right to call for security. Clause should be balanced. Section 5.5a -- ""its best efforts"" should be changed to ""commercially reasonable efforts"". Sections 5.8 & 5.9 --  Need clauses addressing ""undertakes by Buyer"" and ""overtakes by Buyer"". Section 6.3b --  20 days should be changed to 15 days in each location in this section. Section 6.4 ---  Needs a lot of explanation.  Why is it here?  Why would we agree to such? Article 10 - Force Majeure -  Need to add Enron language as to items which are not force majeure. Article 11 - Default -  Need to add additional Triggering Events, Early Termination, and Termination Damage provisions. Also, need to add provisions for limitation of liability and waiver of consequential damages. Let me know how you would like to proceed.  I do not think that they will agree to make any of the changes we would need to do the deal.  Would they be willing to contract using the GISB form of agreement? Janet H Wallis 01/04/2001 11:20 AM 
See attached contract below.  Ignore 4.1 and 4.2, those will have to be changed.  Also, keep an eye out in 4.4 - the default language for confirmations; 10.2 - the Force Majeure language; 18.2 - 3 rd party beneficiary; and 10.4 - transportion is not (?) subject to force Majeure? Thanks, J 
Susan, I have reviewed the contract form that you provided in November and have attempted to make the changes which would be required for Enron to utilize the form.  I believe that the red line document attached  should address a majority of the issues which  need to be changed.  Please review and give me you comments as to the suggested changes.

Will this work for you.  Let me know. 
Dan: I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the fact that we ""need"" ""financially firm"" language in all contracts.  When the Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his trading intentions and it was assumed that ""financially firm"" ""needed"" to be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants ""financially firm"" out and ""firm"" substituted. The definition for ""firm"" that they want in the contract is the standard definition for ""firm"" that is in the GISB as follows: ""Firm"" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter. 
Bob, The Reliant people are only wanting to make changes to the contract between Reliant and enovate. the ena/enovate contract was signed a long time ago before midwest energy changed their name to enovate. Bob Bowen 01/22/2001 04:39 PM 
This makes no sense to me.  What input does Reliant have on a contract between ENA and enovate, L.L.C.? DEBRA PERLINGIERE 01/22/2001 03:57 PM 
A Master Agreement  for execution has been sent to Ennovate.  Dan Hyvl is working with the Chicago office in this matter.

It works like this: 1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with us) 2) That deal runs through July 01 3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to finance a discount to index for an extra six months. 4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the volume one extends the full volume. I need help with a couple of things: 1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal that will allow us to transact without it. 2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system Thanks, Dave Fuller 503-464-3732

These are the Reliant Energy - Entex transactions which need to be signed by Entex and ENA.  All other tickets have either been previously documented or cancelled by other deal tickets. The below list is all of the Entex Gas Resources Corp. transactions which have been done by Janet which have not been signed. These are all of the outstanding deal ticket confirmations according to 
Christian, I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached contract document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended that the Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on any invoice that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way that we have to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.  Therefore, i have not removed that line from the address,  At such time as the Purchase Order Number is available, please send a revised address notice to the company containing such number.  Until that happens, it will be understood that no number has been provided.  Please call if you have any questions. ""Pfister, Christian W."" <CWPfister@cps-satx.com> 01/23/2001 10:43 AM 
Mr. Hyvl, I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed a couple of items: 1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5) ""and wire instructions"" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change it to read:  ""The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality

Greg, Please comment,  You gave me the chicago addresses.  now someone in houston is changing to houston addresses.  what is correct? 
Dan: Will Enovate cause us to become ""undone"" or what?  Today, one of our Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron, Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at 713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd like to do what would best streamline this process. Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help. Regards, Ellen 
Dan: I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the fact that we ""need"" ""financially firm"" language in all contracts.  When the Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his trading intentions and it was assumed that ""financially firm"" ""needed"" to be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants ""financially firm"" out and ""firm"" substituted. The definition for ""firm"" that they want in the contract is the standard definition for ""firm"" that is in the GISB as follows: ""Firm"" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter. 
TODAY'S JOKE ABSOLUTELY SWEET MARIE submitted by Tim Breth Billy Bob and Lester were   talking one afternoon when Billy Bob tells Lester, ""Ya know, I reckon I'm about ready for a vacation. Only this year I'm gonna do it a little different.  The last few years, I took your suggestions as to where to go.  Three years ago you said to go to Hawaii. I went to Hawaii and Marie got pregnant.  Then two years ago, you told me to go to the Bahamas, and Marie got pregnant again.  Last year you suggested Tahiti and darned if Marie didn't get pregnant

Kyle, All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company should be made by Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Please identify the two deals that you have under HPL so that we can get them documented under the proper ECT agreement. Kyle R Lilly 08/30/99 02:45 PM 
Dan, Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC. Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know. Thanks, Kyle 
Ellen, The enovate office in Chicago tells me that the addresses in the Contract are correct as written and that they have gotten with the people in Houston to get them to leave the addresses as contained in the contract.  Regarding the Financially Firm language, I would suggest that you line through the word Financially in each case where it occurs in the contract, line through the entire definition of Financially Firm and have the person who signs for Reliant initial each of the line outs.   I do not feel that we need to define the term Firm.  Our view of the contract is that the obligations are always firm so no further clarification is needed.  Do you concur?  If so, forward the signed and initialled contracts together with the signed Transaction Agreements and I will have the enovate officer also initial the line outs and return a final fully executed contract to you.

A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone. Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the
