A conference call has been scheduled for Friday, May 18th.  Below is the call in information: DATE:  Friday, May 18th TIME:   10:00 am (Central) - should last approx 1 hour CALL IN #:  1-877-214-0402 HOST CODE: 564778   (Steve Kean's use only) PARTICIPANT CODE:  285987 If anyone needs to call in from an international location, please contact Maureen McVicker at 713-853-1808 and she will set up an international number too.

As we receive more contact information, revised lists will be emailed to everyone. ______________________________________________________________________________ _________ A conference call has been scheduled for Friday, May 18th. If credit issues are to be discussed, this is the call in number we will use. If credit issues are not to be discussed, a separate call in number will be set up and you will be notified with the new dial in numbers. DATE:  Friday, May 18th TIME:   10:00 am (Central) - should last approx 1 hour CALL IN #:  1-877-214-0402 HOST CODE: 564778   (Steve Kean's use only) PARTICIPANT CODE:  285987 If anyone needs to call in from an international location, please contact Maureen McVicker at 713-853-1808 and she will set up an international number too. ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Here is the summary Jeff Dasovich sent regarding yesterday's conference call. Greetings: In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything. Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Attached are the contact lists.

FYI Ken Lay faxed this letter to Gov. Davis today. If I left anyone off the list, please for this to them. Thanks. 
Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay: Urged us to ""stay at the table"". Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices). QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity). Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh. If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply). Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening. Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?). Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution. Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power. Says securitization may be harder to get. Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson. 
Please see attached editorial, which ran in yesterday's New York Times and is in today's Houston Chronicle.  We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy. SF team -- Please distribute to all legislators, trade and industry organizations,  etc. Linda -- Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington. Maureen -- Please distribute to the internal GA team. Thanks. kd Editorial Desk; Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE 01/11/2001 The New York Times Page 31, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company LOS ANGELES -- In the past decade, California has become the most Democratic state in the nation. It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democratic senators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands. Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast. Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubled in the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike; worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stack of chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the state's hair stand on end. The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame? The chosen villain: deregulation. As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices. Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control. But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as in Russia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do. California's politicians deregulated halfway, which is the worst way: wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not. Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled to buy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations. This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand. The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power. Result: upward pressure on prices, calls for rationing, utilities going broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of the nation's product. The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the real villain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' to power plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain on electric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years. Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in the wall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop, air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes out of the wall. Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now a safe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity's household convenience. The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout. When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask for wholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives, with photo op to follow. Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On the moon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may please some new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist. After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present political-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply. Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Per your conversation with Steve. 
Here are the talking points for Jeff's discussion with Chambers 
Steve asked that I forward this to you. CONFIDENTIAL - talking points for Lay's conversation with Glynn. 
Please see attached editorial, which ran in yesterday's New York Times and is in today's Houston Chronicle.  We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy. SF team -- Please distribute to all legislators, trade and industry organizations,  etc. Linda -- Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington. Maureen -- Please distribute to the internal GA team. Thanks. kd Editorial Desk; Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE 01/11/2001 The New York Times Page 31, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company LOS ANGELES -- In the past decade, California has become the most Democratic state in the nation. It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democratic senators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands. Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast. Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubled in the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike; worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stack of chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the state's hair stand on end. The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame? The chosen villain: deregulation. As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices. Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control. But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as in Russia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do. California's politicians deregulated halfway, which is the worst way: wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not. Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled to buy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations. This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand. The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power. Result: upward pressure on prices, calls for rationing, utilities going broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of the nation's product. The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the real villain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' to power plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain on electric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years. Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in the wall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop, air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes out of the wall. Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now a safe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity's household convenience. The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout. When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask for wholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives, with photo op to follow. Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On the moon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may please some new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist. After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present political-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply. Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay: Urged us to ""stay at the table"". Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices). QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity). Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh. If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply). Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening. Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?). Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution. Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power. Says securitization may be harder to get. Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson. 
FYI Ken Lay faxed this letter to Gov. Davis today. If I left anyone off the list, please for this to them. Thanks.

Hi Steve, For some awful reason, this did not make it to you on Friday afternoon when I sent it.  Hopefully it finds you this time! I received your agenda changes, but I would appreciate you looking over the steering committee when you have a chance. Thanks for your time, MSA 
Hi Steve, I have attached the steering committee and agenda for review. Mark has made significant changes to both documents, so your input would be appreciated. Please narrow the steering committee list down to around 30.  For the agenda, please focus on content and not timing (since the dates changed per our conversation). Your feedback is needed as soon as possible.  Our goal is to send invitations to speakers and steering committee members within the next week. Thank you for your time! Have a good weekend, Margaret

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some talking points for your use. Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not. In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not deregulation. When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX (i.e. the spot market). In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes. Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market responds. The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation.  Policy makers should: Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed. Expedite interconnection of new generation. Expedite siting of new facilities. Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side solutions. Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

UPDATE:  AT THIS TIME, OUR GROUP PARTICIPATION IN UNITED WAY IS ONLY 50% PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO FILL OUT YOUR UNITED WAY PLEDGE TODAY. 
Thanks for taking the time to discuss the Enron Advisory Council today.  I think the second topic you mentioned ""Escaping the Inherent Limits of Success"" would be a great discussion starter.  I'll add it to the agenda and look forward to seeing you there. 
Please forward this to Steve Kean The information we previously sent you was wrong based on information given by PG&E. Further investigation has lead to us discovering that the California Utilities do offer an option on all their rate schedules for all customer classes in which the customer can choose to install a real time meter and be subject to the hourly PX price. The customer must pay for the meter (approx. $1,200) and all related metering activities: installation including the installation of an extra telephone line, maintenance and reading. If the customer chooses the PX Price Option, he/she will be billed the bundled amount credited the PX credit and added the actual usage/hour times PX hourly price. However, it is very likely that very few customers and no bundled residential or small customers have chosen this option. Bruno 
""Congratulations to two more winners! Earlene O'Connell and Joan Stransky have won $25 Enron Shop gift certificates for making their pledges. However, we are still at only 50% participation and the campaign is coming to a close. Please log in at unitedway.enron.com to make your pledge or decline participation.

Response from Steve Kean: Ken will be cosponsoring the event and asked us to do a PAC contribution.  I think your points are most valid and we'll reduce to $2,000. Joe Hillings 10/24/2000 03:07 PM 
Joe Hillings Enron 1775 Eye Street, NW Suite 800 Washington, DC  20006 202-466-9145 202-828-3372 (fax) email:  jhillin@enron.com Steve: I understand that you are considering a $3,500 Enron PAC contribution to Congresswoman Shiela Jackson Lee. Chris and Citigroup co-hosted an event for Shiela last August in Washington which raised $17,000. Additionally, Enron PAC contributed $1,500 for her primary race (she had no race) and $1,000 for the general election. Her opposition is nominal. We have also handled various personal requests for her such as tickets to Enron Field. She has been helpful on several issues this year such as H1-B Visa and was in India with President Clinton at which she spoke to the Power Minister in a helpful way. Ken Lay and others jawboned her to get her vote in favor of PNTR for China although I think she was bargaining with everyone as she frequently does. Chris Long has developed a good relationship with Shiela but she seldom seeks us out and I think her ""delayed"" position on PNTR for China was unbecoming a representative from Houston. Houston will gain from PNTR for China. I would recommend a maximum of $2,000 to go along with our recommendation that she be more attentive to our positions on leading issues. Joe

Maureen- would you distribute this note Friday morning  to everyone who participates in the Friday call. Thanks.T Again I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group. Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates. At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff schedule Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels. Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of experiences we've seen in Europe. Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda. Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line. Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way. Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went. What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry: an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out Open markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned. Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes. It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true. We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job. We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future. Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen. We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th. I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects. Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.

Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard. Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to understand those reasons). What did the group accomplish? Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes? Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future? Any changes to the working group process itself? Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the feedback by confidential e-mail to me.

Attached is a summary of the results of our effort to deploy talent within Enron.  From today forward, Cindy will manage the effort with the help of her Resource Management team headed by Sarah Davis.  Cindy's team is also developing a process to manage the movement of talent around Enron on an ongoing basis. As you can see we have accomplished a great deal in a short time, thanks in large part to the efforts and cooperation of the business unit organizations and the Human Resources organization.  Highlights include: 60 commercial employees who have accepted offers 19 additional commercial employees with offers pending 74 employees who are being redeployed by their global function or corporate staff group A conservative estimate of the direct costs saved by this effort (as compared to outside recruiting and relocation) is $75,000/employee (or about $4.5 million so far).  Far more important than the direct cost savings, though, are the productivity gains, the opportunity gains associated with deploying resources quickly to critical business areas, and the savings resulting from reducing management time spent in recruiting and interviewing. This effort has focussed on the redeployment of approximately 300 employees in three main groups: Identification of commercial employees across Enron to be contacted and redeployed to EBS, EES and ENA.  There are 92 such employees (not counting APACHI employees).  These employees were contacted, interviewed and are being placed, if they are interested, in one of the three organizations (EBS, EES or ENA). Identification of APACHI employees who are available as a result of the region's efforts to refocus its activities on the opportunities in Japan, Korea and Australia.  There are 208 employees in this category 62 of whom are commercial employees being placed as a result of this effort. The remaining group of 146 APACHI employees consist of global function, staff and support groups which are redeploying them to support constrained areas throughout Enron. Attached is a chart summarizing the progress so far.  Thank you for your 
The Enron government affairs group has been actively involved in a number of international initiatives to support our arious business units.  These activities have ranged from specific project advocacy with the U.S. government to active leadership in multilateral trade organizations (like WTO) and relationship building with international funding institutions. Other than the specific project advocacy, much of this work has been relatively general, based on well accepted Enron objectives such as liberalization and privatization.  Going forward, as we have discussed, I would like to see our strategy and objectives for interaction with these organizations built up from specific business unit objectives.  Consequently, I will be setting up a series of conference calls to include representatives from the regional government affairs groups and people who have been working with the international trade and funding organizations (to describe the tools which may available to meet regional business unit objectives). The objective will be to come out of the discussion with specific objectives and strategies for using the relationships and tools available to us to

Hi Steve, Thanks again for meeting with me last week about ideas for saving money on Enron's videos. You asked me whether or not our new ""Pro-Sumer"" field production equipment can download directly into e-mail.  The answer is yes and no.  The camera has a feature that will enable us to play back still pictures into e-mail or file storage.  We do not, however, have technology that will enable us to download moving video straight from the camera into a computer.  As far as we know, you still need to encode video for computer applications.  Now that we know that's something you're interested in doing, we'll keep our eye on the technology and let you know when it has been developed. I talked with Mary about the ideas I presented to you, but have not yet talked with Mark Palmer.  I'm planning to send him an e-mail this afternoon.

Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Attached are the contact lists.

Wolfgang- I am asking Tom Briggs to bottom this out with OFffice of Froeign Assets Control, or US State Department Sanctions people, and asking Steve Kean is there is any corporate policy regarding purchase of Iraqi oil under 
Mark: I am looking at a proposal, under which a Russian oil-major would be wishing to sell Iraqui crude to us, coming from the UN oil-for-food program. I would be interested to learn, whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this program (provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program) and whether we are willing to do it (corporate policy). I want to check that out first, before going forward. Next step would be to receive a good level of confidence that the offer is genuine, and then I would talk to the liquids traders.

Mr. Steve Kean Executive Vice President Enron Corp Dear Mr. Steve Kean It was such a pleasure having chance do an interview last week. I have a few follow up questions. 1)According to today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Jeffrey Skilling, president and chief executive-elect of Enron, is saying the company could sell some power to PG&E and SoCal at 55 cents per kilowatt hour. Am I understanding your position right? Is it going to be something like a 5 year contract? Will it help your business at all? 2)California Power Exchange has decided to cease its operation by the end of April. Do you think this is the right decision? How do you think you can set up a new competitive market? Or, won't you need such a market? Will it be better to use the markets outside Califorinia or to rely on direct trading? 3)How much supply do you have in excess from which you can offer power to California? ****************************************************************************** * I understand you are very busy but I would really appreciate if you could send me a reply at your earliest convenience. Thank you very much. **************************************************************************** Kiyoshi Ando NIKKEI News TEL 202-204-2104 FAX 202-737-0170 e-mail andou_wdc@nikkei.com 815, Connecticut Ave. NW #310 Washington DC 20006

Please see attached editorial, which ran in yesterday's New York Times and is in today's Houston Chronicle.  We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy. SF team -- Please distribute to all legislators, trade and industry organizations,  etc. Linda -- Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington. Maureen -- Please distribute to the internal GA team. Thanks. kd Editorial Desk; Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE 01/11/2001 The New York Times Page 31, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company LOS ANGELES -- In the past decade, California has become the most Democratic state in the nation. It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democratic senators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands. Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast. Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubled in the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike; worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stack of chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the state's hair stand on end. The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame? The chosen villain: deregulation. As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices. Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control. But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as in Russia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do. California's politicians deregulated halfway, which is the worst way: wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not. Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled to buy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations. This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand. The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power. Result: upward pressure on prices, calls for rationing, utilities going broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of the nation's product. The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the real villain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' to power plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain on electric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years. Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in the wall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop, air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes out of the wall. Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now a safe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity's household convenience. The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout. When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask for wholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives, with photo op to follow. Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On the moon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may please some new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist. After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present political-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply. Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay: Urged us to ""stay at the table"". Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices). QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity). Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh. If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply). Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening. Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?). Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution. Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power. Says securitization may be harder to get. Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.

Bias Suit Against Microsoft Aims at `Flat' Workplace Hierarchies By Yochi J. Dreazen and Jess Bravin Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 01/04/2001 The Wall Street Journal A10 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) The lawyers pursuing a racial discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. are gearing up to put merit pay and other cherished tenets of the New Economy workplace on trial before both a jury and the court of public opinion. The suit, which was filed yesterday in federal court in Washington, D.C., seeks class-action status on behalf of hundreds of current and former black employees of the Redmond, Wash., software giant. The plaintiffs, a group of seven current and former Microsoft employees, accuse the company of racial discrimination with regard to promotions and compensation, and also allege that Microsoft wrongfully terminated some of its black employees. The suit asks for at least $5 billion of compensatory and punitive damages. ""They have a plantation-type mentality when it comes to the treatment of African-American employees at the company,"" said Willie Gary, the high-profile plaintiffs' attorney bringing the suit, who also is involved in

Maureen: Ginger asked me to forward this summary to you, and that Steve asked you to send it to others.  Please note that the attached summary is just the first in several to come today, and I will send them to you as we finish them. However, the PJM one is probably the most important one, so it's a good one to get out early. Please call me if you have any questions. Sarah 
Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it. We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just let us know.

Hi Steve, For some awful reason, this did not make it to you on Friday afternoon when I sent it.  Hopefully it finds you this time! I received your agenda changes, but I would appreciate you looking over the steering committee when you have a chance. Thanks for your time, MSA 
Hi Steve, I have attached the steering committee and agenda for review. Mark has made significant changes to both documents, so your input would be appreciated. Please narrow the steering committee list down to around 30.  For the agenda, please focus on content and not timing (since the dates changed per our conversation). Your feedback is needed as soon as possible.  Our goal is to send invitations to speakers and steering committee members within the next week. Thank you for your time! Have a good weekend, Margaret

The United Way kickoff is here!  The ""Millionaire Game for Millions"" will be played after the Employee Meeting this Wed. at the Hyatt.  A FREE lunch will be provided in the park after the game.  It will be a casual day and wear green to support the CORP. game show participants. I encourage you to click on the United Way web site to make a contribution. Everyone that makes a contribution by COB Friday will be eligible for the Governmental Affairs raffle for BIG PRIZES!! While I encourage you to give generously, any amount is certainly helpful.  A weekly contribution of: $1 provides 8 families with a week's work of food $2 helps teach 5 adults to read, breaking the cycle of illiteracy $5 provides 60 seniors with a nutritious meal and social interaction at a senior center For example, last year UW in the Houston Gulf Coast area fed more than 1,000,000 seniors; helped 42,000 children attend quality childcare; and provided job training to 45,000 people.  Through United Way's volunteer allocation committees, projects are funded and reviewed to ensure accountability.  It is an effective way to give back to our community. 
As you have probably observed, power markets have been severely tested this summer.  There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).  But, the soundbite on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the grid.  The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of re-regulation. At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective: How great of a threat is re-regulation. How might we respond. 
I would like to exchange ideas on topics for the upcoming Enron Advisory Council meeting.  The discussion you led last time was particularly thought provoking and I'd like to extend an open-ended invitation for you to take the floor again on a topic of your choice. We will have presentations from Gavyn Davies and Larry Lindsay on macroeconomic trends as well as the customary domestic political update from Bill Kristol.  The balance of the meeting will focus on markets which are, or could be, commoditized.  We will update the Council on new markets we've added to the Enron portfolio through Enron Networks, (most recently metals and paper).  A presentation by you on this, or another trend, would be most welcome. 
Bill: I am hoping we can count on you for the domestic political update.  We should have a lot to talk about this time. Please let me know. 
The agenda I'm trying to put together for the next meeting will include the customary presentations from Davies/Lindsay and Kristol as well as the energy policy discussion we are looking for from you and Bob. We will also be updating the council on Enron Networks - - a business unit formed to extend Enron's business model to other industries (especially commodities or ""commoditzable"" goods).   Most recently we have extended into metals, expanded our presence in paper, and begun an examination of agricultural commodities.  I'd like your help in identifying a guest participant who may help us think through some of the issues from either (or both) of two perspectives: business strategy:  what markets are candidates for commoditization.  (I have asked Gary Hamel to consider this topic as well). public policy:  as more businesses adopt online business models (like exchanges), as more goods are bought and sold like commodities, and as more transactions move off the traditional regulated exchanges, how are policy makers (SEC, FTC, CFTC and their overseas counterparts) likely to react? 
I am hoping we can prevail upon you two for your customary, if not always cheery, review of macroeconomic trends. Please let me know. 
I am contacting you on the recommendation of Pug Winokur, who is on our Board of Directors.

Executive Committee Weekly Meeting 
""Congratulations to two more winners! Earlene O'Connell and Joan Stransky have won $25 Enron Shop gift certificates for making their pledges. However, we are still at only 50% participation and the campaign is coming to a close. Please log in at unitedway.enron.com to make your pledge or decline participation. 
Please forward this to Steve Kean The information we previously sent you was wrong based on information given by PG&E. Further investigation has lead to us discovering that the California Utilities do offer an option on all their rate schedules for all customer classes in which the customer can choose to install a real time meter and be subject to the hourly PX price. The customer must pay for the meter (approx. $1,200) and all related metering activities: installation including the installation of an extra telephone line, maintenance and reading. If the customer chooses the PX Price Option, he/she will be billed the bundled amount credited the PX credit and added the actual usage/hour times PX hourly price. However, it is very likely that very few customers and no bundled residential or small customers have chosen this option. Bruno 
Thanks for taking the time to discuss the Enron Advisory Council today.  I think the second topic you mentioned ""Escaping the Inherent Limits of Success"" would be a great discussion starter.  I'll add it to the agenda and look forward to seeing you there.

STEVE KEAN Katherine Brown@ENRON 08/15/2000 11:24 AM Executive Committee Weekly Meeting 
As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some talking points for your use. Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not. In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not deregulation. When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX (i.e. the spot market). In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes. Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market responds. The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation.  Policy makers should: Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed. Expedite interconnection of new generation. Expedite siting of new facilities. Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side solutions. Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff Dasovich of our San Francisco office. 
Please see the attached memo. 
If you haven't already done so, please give the performance review feedback to your people (with the exception of Vice Presidents) as soon as possible. The only remaining PRC meeting is for Vice Presidents and Managing Directors.

Response from Steve Kean: Ken will be cosponsoring the event and asked us to do a PAC contribution.  I think your points are most valid and we'll reduce to $2,000. Joe Hillings 10/24/2000 03:07 PM 
Joe Hillings Enron 1775 Eye Street, NW Suite 800 Washington, DC  20006 202-466-9145 202-828-3372 (fax) email:  jhillin@enron.com Steve: I understand that you are considering a $3,500 Enron PAC contribution to Congresswoman Shiela Jackson Lee. Chris and Citigroup co-hosted an event for Shiela last August in Washington which raised $17,000. Additionally, Enron PAC contributed $1,500 for her primary race (she had no race) and $1,000 for the general election. Her opposition is nominal. We have also handled various personal requests for her such as tickets to Enron Field. She has been helpful on several issues this year such as H1-B Visa and was in India with President Clinton at which she spoke to the Power Minister in a helpful way. Ken Lay and others jawboned her to get her vote in favor of PNTR for China although I think she was bargaining with everyone as she frequently does. Chris Long has developed a good relationship with Shiela but she seldom seeks us out and I think her ""delayed"" position on PNTR for China was unbecoming a representative from Houston. Houston will gain from PNTR for China. I would recommend a maximum of $2,000 to go along with our recommendation that she be more attentive to our positions on leading issues. Joe

The Enron government affairs group has been actively involved in a number of international initiatives to support our arious business units.  These activities have ranged from specific project advocacy with the U.S. government to active leadership in multilateral trade organizations (like WTO) and relationship building with international funding institutions. Other than the specific project advocacy, much of this work has been relatively general, based on well accepted Enron objectives such as liberalization and privatization.  Going forward, as we have discussed, I would like to see our strategy and objectives for interaction with these organizations built up from specific business unit objectives.  Consequently, I will be setting up a series of conference calls to include representatives from the regional government affairs groups and people who have been working with the international trade and funding organizations (to describe the tools which may available to meet regional business unit objectives). The objective will be to come out of the discussion with specific objectives and strategies for using the relationships and tools available to us to 
Please plan to attend a meeting at 5:00 p.m. TODAY, regarding the gas and power price situation in California. We will be discussing political, legal and PR implications and actions. TIME:    5:00 p.m. PLACE:   EB 3321 (for those in Houston) CALL IN #:   888-422-7109 HOST CODE:   494397  (for Steve Kean's use only) 
Attached is a summary of the results of our effort to deploy talent within Enron.  From today forward, Cindy will manage the effort with the help of her Resource Management team headed by Sarah Davis.  Cindy's team is also developing a process to manage the movement of talent around Enron on an ongoing basis. As you can see we have accomplished a great deal in a short time, thanks in large part to the efforts and cooperation of the business unit organizations and the Human Resources organization.  Highlights include: 60 commercial employees who have accepted offers 19 additional commercial employees with offers pending 74 employees who are being redeployed by their global function or corporate staff group A conservative estimate of the direct costs saved by this effort (as compared to outside recruiting and relocation) is $75,000/employee (or about $4.5 million so far).  Far more important than the direct cost savings, though, are the productivity gains, the opportunity gains associated with deploying resources quickly to critical business areas, and the savings resulting from reducing management time spent in recruiting and interviewing. This effort has focussed on the redeployment of approximately 300 employees in three main groups: Identification of commercial employees across Enron to be contacted and redeployed to EBS, EES and ENA.  There are 92 such employees (not counting APACHI employees).  These employees were contacted, interviewed and are being placed, if they are interested, in one of the three organizations (EBS, EES or ENA). Identification of APACHI employees who are available as a result of the region's efforts to refocus its activities on the opportunities in Japan, Korea and Australia.  There are 208 employees in this category 62 of whom are commercial employees being placed as a result of this effort. The remaining group of 146 APACHI employees consist of global function, staff and support groups which are redeploying them to support constrained areas throughout Enron. Attached is a chart summarizing the progress so far.  Thank you for your

ENRON WASHINGTON MEMORANDUM TO:  ENRON WTO TASK FORCE: John Ambler Jose Bestard Scott Bolton Hap Boyd Rob Bradley Aleck Dadson Carolyn Green Chris Long Mac McClelland0 Janine Migden David Merrill Mona Petrochko Rick Shapiro Peter Styles Edith Terry Terry Thorn FROM:  Joe Hillings DATE:  12/20/99 RE:  ENRON WTO WORKING GROUP 
Steve Kean would like all of those in Houston to go down to the 7th floor (EB 791) before 5:00 p.m. today and have your picture taken. We are gathering digital photos of the group. Thanks. 
This is the note I want you to distribute. You may have gotten by mistake a shorter version which you can discard. 
Maureen- would you distribute this note Friday morning  to everyone who participates in the Friday call. Thanks.T Again I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group. Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates. At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff schedule Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels. Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of experiences we've seen in Europe. Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda. Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line. Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way. Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went. What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry: an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out Open markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned. Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes. It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true. We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job. We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future. Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen. We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th. I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects. Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.

Hi Steve, Thanks again for meeting with me last week about ideas for saving money on Enron's videos. You asked me whether or not our new ""Pro-Sumer"" field production equipment can download directly into e-mail.  The answer is yes and no.  The camera has a feature that will enable us to play back still pictures into e-mail or file storage.  We do not, however, have technology that will enable us to download moving video straight from the camera into a computer.  As far as we know, you still need to encode video for computer applications.  Now that we know that's something you're interested in doing, we'll keep our eye on the technology and let you know when it has been developed. I talked with Mary about the ideas I presented to you, but have not yet talked with Mark Palmer.  I'm planning to send him an e-mail this afternoon. 
Although I realize some of you may not be able to join on such short notice, please try to participate in a conference call in preparation for the FERC meeting on Thursday.  I'd really like to have your input.

If credit issues are to be discussed, this is the call in number we will use. If credit issues are not to be discussed, a separate call in number will be set up and you will be notified with the new dial in numbers. DATE:  Friday, May 18th TIME:   10:00 am (Central) - should last approx 1 hour CALL IN #:  1-877-214-0402 HOST CODE: 564778   (Steve Kean's use only) PARTICIPANT CODE:  285987 If anyone needs to call in from an international location, please contact Maureen McVicker at 713-853-1808 and she will set up an international number too. ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Here is the summary Jeff Dasovich sent regarding yesterday's conference call. Greetings: In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything. Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Attached are the contact lists.

Wolfgang- I am asking Tom Briggs to bottom this out with OFffice of Froeign Assets Control, or US State Department Sanctions people, and asking Steve Kean is there is any corporate policy regarding purchase of Iraqi oil under 
Mark: I am looking at a proposal, under which a Russian oil-major would be wishing to sell Iraqui crude to us, coming from the UN oil-for-food program. I would be interested to learn, whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this program (provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program) and whether we are willing to do it (corporate policy). I want to check that out first, before going forward. Next step would be to receive a good level of confidence that the offer is genuine, and then I would talk to the liquids traders.

Mr. Steve Kean Executive Vice President Enron Corp Dear Mr. Steve Kean It was such a pleasure having chance do an interview last week. I have a few follow up questions. 1)According to today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Jeffrey Skilling, president and chief executive-elect of Enron, is saying the company could sell some power to PG&E and SoCal at 55 cents per kilowatt hour. Am I understanding your position right? Is it going to be something like a 5 year contract? Will it help your business at all? 2)California Power Exchange has decided to cease its operation by the end of April. Do you think this is the right decision? How do you think you can set up a new competitive market? Or, won't you need such a market? Will it be better to use the markets outside Califorinia or to rely on direct trading? 3)How much supply do you have in excess from which you can offer power to California? ****************************************************************************** * I understand you are very busy but I would really appreciate if you could send me a reply at your earliest convenience. Thank you very much. **************************************************************************** Kiyoshi Ando NIKKEI News TEL 202-204-2104 FAX 202-737-0170 e-mail andou_wdc@nikkei.com 815, Connecticut Ave. NW #310 Washington DC 20006

Please see attached editorial, which ran in yesterday's New York Times and is in today's Houston Chronicle.  We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy. SF team -- Please distribute to all legislators, trade and industry organizations,  etc. Linda -- Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington. Maureen -- Please distribute to the internal GA team. Thanks. kd Editorial Desk; Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE 01/11/2001 The New York Times Page 31, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company LOS ANGELES -- In the past decade, California has become the most Democratic state in the nation. It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democratic senators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands. Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast. Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubled in the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike; worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stack of chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the state's hair stand on end. The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame? The chosen villain: deregulation. As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices. Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control. But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as in Russia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do. California's politicians deregulated halfway, which is the worst way: wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not. Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled to buy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations. This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand. The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power. Result: upward pressure on prices, calls for rationing, utilities going broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of the nation's product. The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the real villain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' to power plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain on electric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years. Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in the wall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop, air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes out of the wall. Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now a safe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity's household convenience. The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout. When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask for wholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives, with photo op to follow. Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On the moon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may please some new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist. After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present political-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply.

Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay: Urged us to ""stay at the table"". Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices). QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity). Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh. If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply). Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening. Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?). Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution. Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power. Says securitization may be harder to get. Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.

Bias Suit Against Microsoft Aims at `Flat' Workplace Hierarchies By Yochi J. Dreazen and Jess Bravin Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 01/04/2001 The Wall Street Journal A10 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) The lawyers pursuing a racial discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. are gearing up to put merit pay and other cherished tenets of the New Economy workplace on trial before both a jury and the court of public opinion. The suit, which was filed yesterday in federal court in Washington, D.C., seeks class-action status on behalf of hundreds of current and former black employees of the Redmond, Wash., software giant. The plaintiffs, a group of seven current and former Microsoft employees, accuse the company of racial discrimination with regard to promotions and compensation, and also allege that Microsoft wrongfully terminated some of its black employees. The suit asks for at least $5 billion of compensatory and punitive damages. ""They have a plantation-type mentality when it comes to the treatment of African-American employees at the company,"" said Willie Gary, the high-profile plaintiffs' attorney bringing the suit, who also is involved in

Greetings: In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything. Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Attached are the contact lists.

Please see the attached memo regarding the Enron Advisory Council Meeting scheduled for September 16 & 17. 
As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some talking points for your use. Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not. In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not deregulation. When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX (i.e. the spot market). In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes. Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market responds. The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation.  Policy makers should: Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed. Expedite interconnection of new generation. Expedite siting of new facilities. Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side solutions. Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff Dasovich of our San Francisco office. 
I'm forwarding this to you so you can have a copy too. I have printed it out and put it in a folder. 
These have also been submitted to Wade.

UPDATE:  AT THIS TIME, OUR GROUP PARTICIPATION IN UNITED WAY IS ONLY 50% PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO FILL OUT YOUR UNITED WAY PLEDGE TODAY. 
Thanks for taking the time to discuss the Enron Advisory Council today.  I think the second topic you mentioned ""Escaping the Inherent Limits of Success"" would be a great discussion starter.  I'll add it to the agenda and look forward to seeing you there. 
Please forward this to Steve Kean The information we previously sent you was wrong based on information given by PG&E. Further investigation has lead to us discovering that the California Utilities do offer an option on all their rate schedules for all customer classes in which the customer can choose to install a real time meter and be subject to the hourly PX price. The customer must pay for the meter (approx. $1,200) and all related metering activities: installation including the installation of an extra telephone line, maintenance and reading. If the customer chooses the PX Price Option, he/she will be billed the bundled amount credited the PX credit and added the actual usage/hour times PX hourly price. However, it is very likely that very few customers and no bundled residential or small customers have chosen this option. Bruno 
""Congratulations to two more winners! Earlene O'Connell and Joan Stransky have won $25 Enron Shop gift certificates for making their pledges.

Hi Steve, For some awful reason, this did not make it to you on Friday afternoon when I sent it.  Hopefully it finds you this time! I received your agenda changes, but I would appreciate you looking over the steering committee when you have a chance. Thanks for your time, MSA 
Hi Steve, I have attached the steering committee and agenda for review. Mark has made significant changes to both documents, so your input would be appreciated. Please narrow the steering committee list down to around 30.  For the agenda, please focus on content and not timing (since the dates changed per our conversation). Your feedback is needed as soon as possible.  Our goal is to send invitations to speakers and steering committee members within the next week. Thank you for your time! Have a good weekend, Margaret

Peggy - Here is a draft press release which we intend to release before the market opens tomorrow, October 5, regarding the price for TNPC's stock. It is my understanding that this is the format that complies with SEC requirements.  I have worked with Marc Manly in our office and David Stone of Vinson & Elkins. Call me if you have any questions.

Nick, Sorry for the delay.  I have made a few notes for you to consider and a couple of editorial changes.  I think the information is useful and well presented. (Note from Maureen:  I renamed the docs as version B.)  I've only attached the changed documents. 
I checked with Skilling's office and there is nothing scheduled.    The Gov.'s office bascially said ""don't call us, we'll call you"". 
Steve is out of the country this week - but I checked his schedule and it looks like Nov. 29 in DC would work best. I will go ahead and pencil that in on Steve's schedule. Maureen McVicker Steve's Assistant Stelzer@aol.com 10/18/2000 09:23 AM 
Do you prefer Nov. 29 or Dec. 4 in DC? 
Nick: I was wondering if it would be a big problem if I end up not being able to attend the grand opening.  I really want to attend, but I am having some scheduling problems. Please let me know if my missing the event would create any problems.  (I know I'm important, but I'm sure it would be ok for me to miss.)

Response from Steve Kean: Ken will be cosponsoring the event and asked us to do a PAC contribution.  I think your points are most valid and we'll reduce to $2,000. Joe Hillings 10/24/2000 03:07 PM 
Joe Hillings Enron 1775 Eye Street, NW Suite 800 Washington, DC  20006 202-466-9145 202-828-3372 (fax) email:  jhillin@enron.com Steve: I understand that you are considering a $3,500 Enron PAC contribution to Congresswoman Shiela Jackson Lee. Chris and Citigroup co-hosted an event for Shiela last August in Washington which raised $17,000. Additionally, Enron PAC contributed $1,500 for her primary race (she had no race) and $1,000 for the general election. Her opposition is nominal. We have also handled various personal requests for her such as tickets to Enron Field. She has been helpful on several issues this year such as H1-B Visa and was in India with President Clinton at which she spoke to the Power Minister in a helpful way. Ken Lay and others jawboned her to get her vote in favor of PNTR for China although I think she was bargaining with everyone as she frequently does. Chris Long has developed a good relationship with Shiela but she seldom seeks us out and I think her ""delayed"" position on PNTR for China was unbecoming a representative from Houston. Houston will gain from PNTR for China. I would recommend a maximum of $2,000 to go along with our recommendation that she be more attentive to our positions on leading issues. Joe

If you have not logged onto the PEP system to designate reviewers, or approve reviewers for those in your organization, please do so today. The deadline for completing performance evaluation information is November 17.  The performance review process is critical to year-end evaluations and bonus, promotion and compensation decisions. This year, as in previous review periods, the system enables ""360 degree"" feedback throughout the organization.

Although I realize some of you may not be able to join on such short notice, please try to participate in a conference call in preparation for the FERC meeting on Thursday.  I'd really like to have your input. 
Attached is the (near) final draft of the organization announcement. If you have any comments, please contact me as soon as possible. 
Joe: Steve asked that I pass the following request along to you. Kathy Cash, reporter for McGraw Hill, called wanting Steve's comments on the regional market/policy info released by FERC today. Please follow up.  Her number is 202/383-2274.  Thanks. 
This is the note I want you to distribute. You may have gotten by mistake a shorter version which you can discard. 
Maureen- would you distribute this note Friday morning  to everyone who participates in the Friday call. Thanks.T Again I find myself in a time zone (Korea) that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call.  Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual, only an e-mail address that floats in space, it's a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year.  This certainly isn't inclusive for the global affairs group. Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of  activities from  throughout the world in which the group participates. At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas.  Although we  continue to make the rounds to both gauge  reactions to and promote our comments, the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months. The MITI schedule is : November 19 -file comments December 2 -the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITI/guidelines are official December 2 -submitted comments are made public December 31- can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities? Probably not until the Spring January 4 -The electric utilities publish their tariffs March 21 - the market opens under the published tariff schedule Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing. Still we don't expect many if any changes.  My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official: don't do seminars, do business.  Until we can actually test the system with a transaction, we're spinning our wheels. Wrobel's people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then it's up to Hirl, Nick and I  to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations . That's when all of the obstacles the utilities  throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible. We're in for a long, incremental battle.  I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR.  In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of experiences we've seen in Europe. Prior to Tokyo, I was  asked to be at APEC's energy working group meeting in Wellington.   The APEC  Energy Minister's established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval.  The Minister's also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy.  I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years  to represent the US Energy industry. We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure.  This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues. We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation, basically telling PTT there is life after death (privatization/liberalization).  She did great and has the temperate, Knowledge and style to get our meessage across.  Unfortunately, to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds  and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence. Barry Leay, the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese, Mexicans and Chinese. We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work, lost a little on the consultative process (DOE was no help) with a little more EWG control/interference and kept energy services alive at least through  Spring.  Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December 15 to go over developments and plan for 2000.  The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason.   This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of 21 Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda. Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week. Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas.  It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line. Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year. Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda. It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories.  You just assume energy is included. The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period. That was as of Wednesday. Again Joe will know how it ended up. The side meetings were excellent: with Eisenstat (the gaza project, the Bolivia conservation plan-he's on the OPIC board,  and Sutton's ABAC nomination), Secretary Daly (South America), and Mack McLarty.  Mark- Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay, Mack did talk to Clinton about Blair's swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blair's key advisors. Al  will talk to him about his departure from the third way. Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so I'm sure he knocked them dead. Kelly handled all the interviews and I'll look forward to hearing from her how it went. What's alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization. Trade is no longer an economic issue- it's a social issue.  Eisenstat said it best. We have five tasks as a governmment and industry: an education effort about trade and it benefits. we can't be defensive demystify the WTO- it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out Open markets are critical to Enron's international success.  We'll need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block we've got China's WTO agrement with the US.  After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues. No one has any answers yet. I continue to work with Shell and the NGO's to set up the US Trust fund for the $15 million dollar Bolivian conservation plan.  The Associon de Hecht has cleared it's legal review. It's not going to happen until January. We have also had  an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples.  Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno.  Meet with them, find out if we're really at fault, and fix it. I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone, based in Bolivia. She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities. In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone. I will meet with Jim Broad way in December, our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned. Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like we'll get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation. If the 30% holds it's a great vistory that took a year to accomplish.  I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy (I'm on the SK/Enron board) and a new bid for some of KEPCO's genration.  They have just told us they want everyone to bid again. Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam.  We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes. It looks like we've the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPG's from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan. Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true. We got caught in a political p------- contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America. We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines. Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job. We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we don't start generating income we'll have to shut down or at least cut back.  Merrill, Grimes and  Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls. Sue has everyone's comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module. We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems. With all the work we have done over the years, we've never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future. Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for 2000. On the commercialside we'll start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund. We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position- are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale. An internal trading system is inevitable. We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed. The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions. When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits, one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen. We've created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houston's ozone problem. Our next get together will be around the 16th. I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israeli's and others to move the project along. Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso, who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt. When I travelled with Daly last month, I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli, Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers.  There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza, hoepfully to our projects. Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy.

Attached is a summary of the results of our effort to deploy talent within Enron.  From today forward, Cindy will manage the effort with the help of her Resource Management team headed by Sarah Davis.  Cindy's team is also developing a process to manage the movement of talent around Enron on an ongoing basis. As you can see we have accomplished a great deal in a short time, thanks in large part to the efforts and cooperation of the business unit organizations and the Human Resources organization.  Highlights include: 60 commercial employees who have accepted offers 19 additional commercial employees with offers pending 74 employees who are being redeployed by their global function or corporate staff group A conservative estimate of the direct costs saved by this effort (as compared to outside recruiting and relocation) is $75,000/employee (or about $4.5 million so far).  Far more important than the direct cost savings, though, are the productivity gains, the opportunity gains associated with deploying resources quickly to critical business areas, and the savings resulting from reducing management time spent in recruiting and interviewing. This effort has focussed on the redeployment of approximately 300 employees in three main groups: Identification of commercial employees across Enron to be contacted and redeployed to EBS, EES and ENA.  There are 92 such employees (not counting APACHI employees).  These employees were contacted, interviewed and are being placed, if they are interested, in one of the three organizations (EBS, EES or ENA). Identification of APACHI employees who are available as a result of the region's efforts to refocus its activities on the opportunities in Japan, Korea and Australia.  There are 208 employees in this category 62 of whom are commercial employees being placed as a result of this effort. The remaining group of 146 APACHI employees consist of global function, staff and support groups which are redeploying them to support constrained areas throughout Enron. Attached is a chart summarizing the progress so far.  Thank you for your 
The Enron government affairs group has been actively involved in a number of international initiatives to support our arious business units.  These activities have ranged from specific project advocacy with the U.S. government to active leadership in multilateral trade organizations (like WTO) and relationship building with international funding institutions. Other than the specific project advocacy, much of this work has been relatively general, based on well accepted Enron objectives such as liberalization and privatization.  Going forward, as we have discussed, I would like to see our strategy and objectives for interaction with these organizations built up from specific business unit objectives.  Consequently, I will be setting up a series of conference calls to include representatives from the regional government affairs groups and people who have been working with the international trade and funding organizations (to describe the tools which may available to meet regional business unit objectives). The objective will be to come out of the discussion with specific objectives and strategies for using the relationships and tools available to us to

Bias Suit Against Microsoft Aims at `Flat' Workplace Hierarchies By Yochi J. Dreazen and Jess Bravin Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 01/04/2001 The Wall Street Journal A10 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) The lawyers pursuing a racial discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. are gearing up to put merit pay and other cherished tenets of the New Economy workplace on trial before both a jury and the court of public opinion. The suit, which was filed yesterday in federal court in Washington, D.C., seeks class-action status on behalf of hundreds of current and former black employees of the Redmond, Wash., software giant. The plaintiffs, a group of seven current and former Microsoft employees, accuse the company of racial discrimination with regard to promotions and compensation, and also allege that Microsoft wrongfully terminated some of its black employees. The suit asks for at least $5 billion of compensatory and punitive damages. ""They have a plantation-type mentality when it comes to the treatment of African-American employees at the company,"" said Willie Gary, the high-profile plaintiffs' attorney bringing the suit, who also is involved in

Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay: Urged us to ""stay at the table"". Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices). QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity). Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh. If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply). Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening. Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?). Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution. Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power. Says securitization may be harder to get. Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson. 
Please see attached editorial, which ran in yesterday's New York Times and is in today's Houston Chronicle.  We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy. SF team -- Please distribute to all legislators, trade and industry organizations,  etc. Linda -- Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington. Maureen -- Please distribute to the internal GA team. Thanks. kd Editorial Desk; Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE 01/11/2001 The New York Times Page 31, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company LOS ANGELES -- In the past decade, California has become the most Democratic state in the nation. It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democratic senators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands. Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast. Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubled in the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike; worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stack of chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the state's hair stand on end. The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame? The chosen villain: deregulation. As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices. Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control. But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as in Russia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do. California's politicians deregulated halfway, which is the worst way: wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not. Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled to buy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations. This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand. The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power. Result: upward pressure on prices, calls for rationing, utilities going broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of the nation's product. The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the real villain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' to power plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain on electric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years. Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in the wall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop, air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes out of the wall. Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now a safe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity's household convenience. The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout. When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask for wholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives, with photo op to follow. Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On the moon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may please some new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist. After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present political-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply. Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Mr. Steve Kean Executive Vice President Enron Corp Dear Mr. Steve Kean It was such a pleasure having chance do an interview last week. I have a few follow up questions. 1)According to today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Jeffrey Skilling, president and chief executive-elect of Enron, is saying the company could sell some power to PG&E and SoCal at 55 cents per kilowatt hour. Am I understanding your position right? Is it going to be something like a 5 year contract? Will it help your business at all? 2)California Power Exchange has decided to cease its operation by the end of April. Do you think this is the right decision? How do you think you can set up a new competitive market? Or, won't you need such a market? Will it be better to use the markets outside Califorinia or to rely on direct trading? 3)How much supply do you have in excess from which you can offer power to California? ****************************************************************************** * I understand you are very busy but I would really appreciate if you could send me a reply at your earliest convenience. Thank you very much. **************************************************************************** Kiyoshi Ando NIKKEI News TEL 202-204-2104 FAX 202-737-0170 e-mail andou_wdc@nikkei.com 815, Connecticut Ave. NW #310 Washington DC 20006

Mark: I am looking at a proposal, under which a Russian oil-major would be wishing to sell Iraqui crude to us, coming from the UN oil-for-food program. I would be interested to learn, whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this program (provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program) and whether we are willing to do it (corporate policy). I want to check that out first, before going forward. Next step would be to receive a good level of confidence that the offer is genuine, and then I would talk to the liquids traders.

Ken & Jeff, We would like to extend an invitation to you for an event at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, honoring the Frank Gehry Exhibit which Enron is sponsoring.

Enron will have a table of 10 at the Trustee Opening Gala Dinner on May 16th, with cocktails at 7pm and a seated dinner at 8:30pm.  The Gala starts with a private viewing of the exhibition, followed by a seated dinner for 280 people in the Rotunda of the museum. Attendees are comprised of Trustees, government dignitaries, artists, curators and celebrities. Several business unit executives are using this forum to take potential customers and we would like to know if you are interested in attending. Please advise. Thanks, Steve

Greetings: In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything. Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Attached are the contact lists.

Hi Steve, Thanks again for meeting with me last week about ideas for saving money on Enron's videos. You asked me whether or not our new ""Pro-Sumer"" field production equipment can download directly into e-mail.  The answer is yes and no.  The camera has a feature that will enable us to play back still pictures into e-mail or file storage.  We do not, however, have technology that will enable us to download moving video straight from the camera into a computer.  As far as we know, you still need to encode video for computer applications.  Now that we know that's something you're interested in doing, we'll keep our eye on the technology and let you know when it has been developed. I talked with Mary about the ideas I presented to you, but have not yet talked with Mark Palmer.  I'm planning to send him an e-mail this afternoon. 
Steve Kean will not be able to attend (he's out of the country). Joan Stransky 05/30/2001 09:15 AM

The United Way kickoff is here!  The ""Millionaire Game for Millions"" will be played after the Employee Meeting this Wed. at the Hyatt.  A FREE lunch will be provided in the park after the game.  It will be a casual day and wear green to support the CORP. game show participants. I encourage you to click on the United Way web site to make a contribution. Everyone that makes a contribution by COB Friday will be eligible for the Governmental Affairs raffle for BIG PRIZES!! While I encourage you to give generously, any amount is certainly helpful.  A weekly contribution of: $1 provides 8 families with a week's work of food $2 helps teach 5 adults to read, breaking the cycle of illiteracy $5 provides 60 seniors with a nutritious meal and social interaction at a senior center For example, last year UW in the Houston Gulf Coast area fed more than 1,000,000 seniors; helped 42,000 children attend quality childcare; and provided job training to 45,000 people.  Through United Way's volunteer allocation committees, projects are funded and reviewed to ensure accountability.  It is an effective way to give back to our community. 
As you have probably observed, power markets have been severely tested this summer.  There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).  But, the soundbite on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the grid.  The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of re-regulation. At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective: How great of a threat is re-regulation. How might we respond. 
I would like to exchange ideas on topics for the upcoming Enron Advisory Council meeting.  The discussion you led last time was particularly thought provoking and I'd like to extend an open-ended invitation for you to take the floor again on a topic of your choice. We will have presentations from Gavyn Davies and Larry Lindsay on macroeconomic trends as well as the customary domestic political update from Bill Kristol.  The balance of the meeting will focus on markets which are, or could be, commoditized.  We will update the Council on new markets we've added to the Enron portfolio through Enron Networks, (most recently metals and paper).  A presentation by you on this, or another trend, would be most welcome. 
Bill: I am hoping we can count on you for the domestic political update.  We should have a lot to talk about this time. Please let me know. 
The agenda I'm trying to put together for the next meeting will include the customary presentations from Davies/Lindsay and Kristol as well as the energy policy discussion we are looking for from you and Bob. We will also be updating the council on Enron Networks - - a business unit formed to extend Enron's business model to other industries (especially commodities or ""commoditzable"" goods).   Most recently we have extended into metals, expanded our presence in paper, and begun an examination of agricultural commodities.  I'd like your help in identifying a guest participant who may help us think through some of the issues from either (or both) of two perspectives: business strategy:  what markets are candidates for commoditization.  (I have asked Gary Hamel to consider this topic as well). public policy:  as more businesses adopt online business models (like exchanges), as more goods are bought and sold like commodities, and as more transactions move off the traditional regulated exchanges, how are policy makers (SEC, FTC, CFTC and their overseas counterparts) likely to react? 
I am hoping we can prevail upon you two for your customary, if not always cheery, review of macroeconomic trends. Please let me know.

PLEASE NOTE:  This email includes several items. (1)  the call in information for Friday's conference call; (2)  a summary of yesterday's conference call (from Jeff Dasovich, Enron); (3)  two documents that list the contact information we have received to date (please email Steve Kean @ skean.enron.com if any changes/additions need to be made to the list).  As we receive more contact information, revised lists will be emailed to everyone. ______________________________________________________________________________ _________ A conference call has been scheduled for Friday, May 18th. If credit issues are to be discussed, this is the call in number we will use. If credit issues are not to be discussed, a separate call in number will be set up and you will be notified with the new dial in numbers. DATE:  Friday, May 18th TIME:   10:00 am (Central) - should last approx 1 hour CALL IN #:  1-877-214-0402 HOST CODE: 564778   (Steve Kean's use only) PARTICIPANT CODE:  285987 If anyone needs to call in from an international location, please contact Maureen McVicker at 713-853-1808 and she will set up an international number too. ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Here is the summary Jeff Dasovich sent regarding yesterday's conference call. Greetings: In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything. Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B.""  Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a copy of ""Plan B.""  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1:  The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion) ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________ Attached are the contact lists.

Please see attached editorial, which ran in yesterday's New York Times and is in today's Houston Chronicle.  We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy. SF team -- Please distribute to all legislators, trade and industry organizations,  etc. Linda -- Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington. Maureen -- Please distribute to the internal GA team. Thanks. kd Editorial Desk; Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE 01/11/2001 The New York Times Page 31, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company LOS ANGELES -- In the past decade, California has become the most Democratic state in the nation. It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democratic senators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands. Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast. Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubled in the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike; worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stack of chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the state's hair stand on end. The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame? The chosen villain: deregulation. As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices. Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control. But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as in Russia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do. California's politicians deregulated halfway, which is the worst way: wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not. Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled to buy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations. This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand. The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power. Result: upward pressure on prices, calls for rationing, utilities going broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of the nation's product. The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the real villain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' to power plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain on electric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years. Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in the wall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop, air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes out of the wall. Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now a safe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity's household convenience. The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout. When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask for wholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives, with photo op to follow. Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On the moon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may please some new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist. After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present political-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply. Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay: Urged us to ""stay at the table"". Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from which to calculate offering prices). QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight. says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply). believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased forward (perhaps by state entity). Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost based at  4?/kwh. If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply). Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this evening. Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?). Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution. Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power. Says securitization may be harder to get. Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson. 
Steve Kean asked me to forward this information to you. Maureen Raymond:  Will you please forward this information to other woman in the meeting.  I'm sorry but I didn't catch her name. Thanks.

I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General Manager of Federal Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year. Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman, who join me in this recommendation. Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal article identifying Linda among the ""Washington 100"". We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those was Secretary Summers who said:
