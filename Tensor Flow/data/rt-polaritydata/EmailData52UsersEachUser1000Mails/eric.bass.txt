You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L. I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of November.

Yes, but I would say that the $200,000/mo during the winter is related to an HPL discount on Transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the deal more economical. Enron North America Corp. 
Your list of items is correct.  However, the entex related transport shows up on the P&L and the GL via transport expense from Tom to Ed.  This number is manually booked to the GL each month by Phillip.  Therefore, this revenue shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense. Eric Enron North America Corp.

Thanks for your help. There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.

I can't play this weekend.  The earliest I can play would be Sunday December 17. Let me know if this works Michael Simmons 12/06/2000 10:43 AM 
Update: The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms of ref's, a field, etc. If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no playoff for the Enron Texas team.  We can still put a team together by combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further.. -Mike  ext 37842 -- Webb, where are you as far as setting up a time with the aggies?    I think this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday is as good as any.  If not this weekend, you will need to organize this as I will be on vacation for the next two weeks.

Eric, Ami just booked two deals (#148251, #148253) on the BDOL pipe and since that pipe had never been used before we do not have that location mapped to any curves.  As a result those two deals have not bridged to CPR and will remain like this until you provide the necessary curve information listed below.  If you will need to create new curves and that will take a while, let me know if you want me to map this location to some existing curves in the meantime, so it will at least bridge to CPR.  Then, when you create your curves I can just re-map the location to the new curves. There is currently only one zone on this pipe.

I think we'll have a lot of fun this weekend.  Sierra sounds good to me.  I really like that place--I was just there the other night for a recruiting dinner and it's all decorated for Christmas. Jill, Matt's date, who works at Deloitte also lives all the way out in the Woodlands and she is probably going to come to my house and get ready.  I guess we'll figure out the rest of the specifics later. Tomorrow is going to be a pretty rough day here at my client; so give me a call tomorrow night, if that's ok.  Or you can email me--for some reason I didn't get your email until 5:30 today and it looks like you sent it during lunch.

Imelda, Those people that require a Risk Management Role are: Eric Bass Michael Walters O'neal Winfree David Baumbach Bryan Hull Heidi Withers Those people that require a Trader Role are: Thomas Martin Cary Metz Elsa Villareal William Falbaum -Eric Imelda Frayre 12/13/99 04:08 PM 
Eric, I have reviewed the users that have access similar to yours and want to confirm if they are in the Risk Management group for Texas/HPLC.  Please let me know which users are not in your group and also add people in your group that I have not listed. In addition, I noticed that some users have a Risk Management role while others have a Trader role.  The ONLY difference between those two roles is that the trader roles allows you to have access to Trade Blotter.  If no one is entering trades directly into Trade Blotter, let me know so that I can change everyone's roles to the Risk Management role.  It makes it a lot easier when I am trying to categorize users.  You still have access to Deal Ticker, Deal Manager (read/edit) and Position Manager under the Risk Management role.  Thank you for your time in advance and for your quick responses.  I understand that you are busy so please take your time in getting back with the requested information. Bryan Hull Eric Bass Heidi Withers James Mackey Michael Abraham Michael Walters O'Neal Winfree William Falbaum Imelda 
There has apparently been some misunderstanding regarding the scope of calculations that must be covered under the Post ID's submitted for EOL reporting each night. Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must cover this. 
You can send future lists to me. Thanks, Eric Imelda Frayre 12/13/99 03:40 PM 
Eric, who heads your group?  In the future, I am going to send a list for each group to the group heads so they can verify certain information for the entire group instead of me doing it with each user individually. Thanks

Please provide responses to the questions noted above so that I can ensure that you have the adequate security for Sitara.  If you have any questions, please call me at x35423.

Do you know that there are no opening comedians before Dave?  Just a DJ. 
Dan, I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions on EOL ""Force Majeure"" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon Katy Plant and were wondering the ""Force Majeure"" ramifications of the the Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language? Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these pooling zones. I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance. Sincerely, Eric Bass

I have not verified your math but ""championships"" prior to the associated press do not count b/c there was no governing authority that conferred national titles before the AP ( as you will notice the retroactive declaration of national champions prior to the early 1930's).

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend. Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 12???? Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC. Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which

It sounds like someone is working hard and making the company lots of $. Where the hell do you come up with this shit? BRIAN HOSKINS@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 02/20/2001 09:18 AM 
Box Score Banter The following question and statistical numbers come via J.C. Corrigan of Richmond, Va. He asks: ""Which conference is best? Pac -0? ACC? SEC? Big 10? Big 12? Big East? Using the RPI, I evaluated the top eight teams in each conference (ACC is the smallest in terms of members, and I threw out their ""Russian judge"" team). If you were to add these individual team RPI up, the least sum would indicate the greatest depth: Big Ten, 178; SEC, 194; Big East, 246; Big 12, 278; ACC, 369; Pac-10, 382. Now some may argue that you should not count the bottom teams, since half are forced into a losing record. Others say, only one team can win, so why concern yourself with the bottom feeders? To refute that, here's what the sums look like using only the top four teams from each conference: SEC, 40; Pac-10, 41; ACC, 48; Big Ten, 49; Big East, 66; Big 12, 69. If indeed each conference has their bottom feeders, then we want to make sure there are no ""gimmies"" for those teams on top. So what's the RPI rating of the lowest team in each conference? SEC, 103 (LSU); Big Ten, 135 (Northwestern); Big 12, 157 (Texas Tech); Big East, 167 (Virginia Tech); ACC, 168 (Clemson) Pac-10, 173 (Washington State)

Hey Dad.  I am looking forward to Vegas.  Hopefully I won't lose too much $. I am glad that I was able to add a little more happiness to her life.  Tell Aunt Twila and Uncle Gene hi for me and have a good time this weekend. Love, Eric ""Larry W. Bass"" <lwbthemarine@bigplanet.com> on 02/15/2001 12:57:14 PM 
Hi Guy. Do hope you have a great trip to Vegas. It  should be fun. Do not let those tables become too attractive to you. The more  time you spend @ the tables the greater the odds are that the house will take  your money. I talk from experience. Nice touch on the flowers to your Mom. She  really is enjoying them. It made her feel good that you remembered her on  Valentine's Day. Call us when you get home. Love-Dad

Big talk for a guy whose school is on NCAA probation as we speak. http://www.ncaa.org/databases/db1/probation.html By the way, I see from the latest RPIs that LSU is really pulling their weight as the lowest-ranked team in the SEC, right behind Austin Peay.

Come talk to me when your team can score more than 33 points in a game. LSU's basketball dynasty is officially over.  Oh, wait a minute.  It never began. Mississippi 50, LSU 33 OXFORD, Miss. (AP) _ Aaron Harper scored 16 points to lead No. 25 Mississippi to a 50-33 victory over Louisiana State on Wednesday night. Harper was the only player in double figures for the Rebels (18-4, 6-3 Southeastern Conference), who won their fourth consecutive game exactly one year after their worst home loss in 40 years _ a 97-53 loss to LSU. Roland Dupree had 14 points and a game-high 11 rebounds for LSU (11-9, 1-8), which was held to fewer than 40 points for the first time since a 51-39 loss at Rice in 1948. The Rebels limited the Tigers to 12-of-43 shooting from the field and forced them into 25 turnovers. LSU also shot just 1-of-16 from 3-point range, but stayed close before the Rebels put it away with a decisive 19-4 run. LSU led only once, on Dupree's opening basket. Ole Miss answered with a 12-5 run and never trailed again. Harper made three consecutive baskets to highlight the surge. The Rebels led 19-15 at halftime, but LSU pulled within 23-22 with 15:19 remaining on a basket by Jermaine Williams. LSU never got any closer as Ole Miss went on its decisive 19-4 run in the next seven minutes. Harper sparked the surge with a pair of 3-pointers and two assists. LSU's DuPree got a technical foul during the run, following his protest of an offensive foul by teammate Torris Bright. Jason Harrison hit both technical foul free throws and Harper followed with a 3-pointer to complete the run and give Ole Miss a 42-26 lead with 7:23 left. _____________________ Brian T.

Are you ready for some football!?!?! I am trying to put together a flag football game this Sunday at 2:30 pm at Rice University.  I need YOUR help to pass this e-mail along to as many friends that you feel would be interested in friendly, competitive flag football.  If you are remotely interested, e-mail me your name and phone number, so I can create a contact list to pass out to everyone.  I don't have any flags or field cones, but if we get enough people interested, I'm sure Enron will sponsor us (if you have flags and/or cones, please bring them; I'll bring the football). The location of our games will be at the practice field, East of the Rice U. stadium (across the parking lot).  I believe our playing field is on Rice University Blvd., between gates 12 and 13.  The field has two field goals and bleachers.  It's hard to miss! I hope everyone is interested.  If not, we didn't need your slow, lazy, unathletic ass anyway... My contact info is 713-345-7594.

I went by some houses last night . . .

how do they know that he was sexually molested though? Brian Hoskins@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/12/2001 10:25 AM 
this is the sickest thing I've ever heard ACCUSED MOLESTER PLEADS INNOCENT IN MONTANA COURT A man accused of sexually molesting a 12-year-old boy, then killing him and serving his body to his neighbors, has pleaded innocent in a Great Falls, Mont., courtroom. Court records indicate that the man, Nathaniel Bar-Jonah, is a career criminal. The 43-year-old is being held on half a million dollars bond. Police say they found notes indicating that Bar-Jonah called dinners

Addendum No. 1 To whom it may concern: It has been brought to my attention that there are some people who are interested in playing paintball games.  However, we were going to play this weekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due to previous engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January 20, 2001.  It will cost about $22.00 and that includes admission for the whole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.  However, paintballs are extra and they cost about $6.50 per 100.  If we do end up playing it would be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not much out there. If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 2001, that way we can decide if we have enough people to even play.  Rain or Shine! Thank you, George Kissamis

Vietnamese War Refugee Becomes Successful Cookbook Author in America Dulles, VA -- (Xpress Press)-- Successful Georgetown clothing designer Diana My Tran, celebrates the culture of her homeland in THE VIETNAMESE COOKBOOK, an easy-to-follow guide to Vietnamese cuisine. In 1975 Diana Tran left Vietnam as part of a mass exodus when Saigon fell to Ho Chi Minh's North Vietnamese troops. The pregnant 20-year-old had no idea where she was going or what she would do when she arrived, and was forced to make a new life for herself in a foreign country.  Over the past two decades she has gone from not knowing a word of English to being a successful clothing designer and dressmaker, with clients in the upper echelons of politics, media, and society. Yet despite her success in America, Diana staunchly holds on to her Vietnamese heritage. ""I want to keep our family heritage alive, es- pecially for my children.  The easiest way to do that is through the food.""  She says that when she first came to America, she missed the many joyous family celebrations and their acc- ompanying feasts, and tried to recreate them for her new friends in America. ""When I first arrived in America, cooking Vietnamese dishes was a challenge, because there were no Asian food stores in Carlisle PA. Most of the time I could not find the tradi- tional ingredients and had to make substitutions, but the food turned out just fine,"" she says. Diana recorded all of these substitutions in her cookbook, keeping the original tastes and textures. The recipes make use of ingredients easily found in local supermarkets, and show step-by-step instructions for making the healthy delights of Vietnamese cuisine fast and simply. ""My time for cooking is as limited as it ever was when I was a new immigrant,"" Tran says. ""Traditional Vietnamese food can take time and effort to prepare-time I usually don't have, so I have created my own easier versions of Vietn- amese dishes, tailored to the busy American

too complicated Enron Capital Management 
I have said it 15 times already, but I will say it again.  Texas was 4-7 in the season prior to Mack Brown.  The program was in shambles .  Mack Brown came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.  Lo and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?  Does it sound familiar?  I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams Texas beat.  So my point is that players get up for new coaches.  You, as LSU fans,  fans can expect about the same next year as this year. Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say "" well that is what you say every year""), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.  So, if he doesn't win the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.  I have a problem saying he is  a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons. As a side note,  look who won the national championship game - the Big 12. If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3  in the bowls while the Sec was 4-5.  If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12 would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.  I see the beginnings of a new college fb powerhouse conference.  The Big 12 will win at least the next  2 NCs. See ya Chad Landry 01/03/2001 09:30 PM 
Looks like you guys have been having some fun during my absence.  I have a question:  How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a few big games in a single football season.  Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting program in shambles.  Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in LSU team history.  However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team victories this year. If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and PRIDE.  So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching our TIGER No-Names win. As Always, its all in Good Fun. CKL Enron North America Corp.

So, I guess we will plan on meeting at Kenneally's on Friday after work (say 4:30 - 5). Tim - let me know if you want me to invite anyone else. 
i just explained my logic - despite losing to OU earlier in the year texas is actually better than them. see below 
i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions. get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same next year. lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships. but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team. 
great.  he can go there with all the talent in the world and get run by the pac-10.

I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help. -E To whom it may concern: I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline. I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride (the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline (Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time. It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight. I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience.

I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out. Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing. See you in Pasadena 2002 EPB Chad Landry 10/24/2000 10:07 AM 
Its all about expectations, my man!  What was Texas Ranked at the beginning of the season????  I am waiting for CNNSI to come out with a poll on the most overrated team of the year---my guess---a pick'em b/w Alabama and Texas.  Any time Texas is challenged they ""you-know-what"" their pants.

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense. Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the way. Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences. It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that). And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to back out of that contract a few years back? See you in the Shreveport. Final Score UT - 58 LSU - 3 Chad Landry 10/24/2000 09:32 AM 
There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball (College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year. However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a crazy ""REEEEEEEE-Verse"" play or maybe even a pass on first down. We can only hope that one of these situations occur! GEAUX TIGERS! http://www.geaux.com/sports/foot/news/001024bowls.htm CKL

Dear Eric, Another 25,417 Petitions were shipped to Florida today by ElectionIntegrity2000.com. Thanks to you we expect to have 100,000 signed petitions to finalize the certification of the George W. Bush victory by the end of the day today.  That's great news! ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and that's going to take numbers. Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide -- especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans behind us. So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell your friends directly to visit http://www.electionintegrity2000.com ""Hand counting"" of ballots is still going on in several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes. Remember, with every day that passes without a certified Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election increase.

From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a split in the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's prime on the left..  We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your left hand side as well as the tennis courts... === If   you are interested in wagering....   here are some bets that Webb Jennings is putting out on the 1 st game. We spot them:  Total Bet: 9 pts   $50 15 pts   $300 22 pts   $500-$600 30 pts   $1,000 He seems to be extra confident in that he has a former Division 2A quarterback... Drew Teamlys  (sp?).

Hey Paul, I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.  The tourney starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game (2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested. Thanks, Eric x3-0977 
we will have a list of patterns just in case people don't know what they are, but the plays are designed to clear out areas so that certain patterns are more open. you can draw plays in excel using the drawing toolbar. what time are we going to scrimmage tomorrow? Michael Simmons 11/14/2000 03:37 PM 
suggestion... make a playbook that just shows individual routes.. that way Luis can just customize  in the huddle.... Ex.   outs, curls, out-and-up, post..  etc... also,,    You give routes to the linemen and they should block  and then roll out into the open flats once the defense goes past.... AND... most importantly.. how did you  draw those plays  excel.... 
Hey Dad, Mom wrote a note to me about your impending surgery.  What is the skinny?  Is this any different from the other skin cancers that you get removed? How are things otherwise? Love, 
I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs. I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?). Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let me know. Let me know what you think. Hook 'Em! -Eric 
here is a template for some plays - it might be helpful to have a list of plays to show during the game 
time to break out some of the old plays? 
i don't know any of those people either Enron Capital Management

Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in more practices. We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you can make it.   ext. 37842. IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled. From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice. Eric please bring a couple of footballs. If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc. ---- Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury. 
Damn it all to hell! What are you doing with my inheritance?  We enjoyed the dinner as well.  We are available whenever you would like to join us.  We should do it at least bi-weekly.

A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really likes a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp. His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much does the quality of the high end amp matter?

I've received the fund raising envelopes for the flag football tournament. I need everyone to pick these envelopes and begin collecting for UT. I'm at 2918b or you can send me your location and I will  try to use the interoffice mail. Alternatively, you can just solicit on your own without the envelope (which makes it more official).   Keep in mind that contributions will be matched by Enron and make checks payable to the University of Texas at Austin.  Last year we donated about $30 K to A&M Bonfire memorial scholarship efforts. Money collected this year will goto the general scholarship fund at UT. Each team is expected to raise $2000  and we have less than 20 days left, so do your part. --- Also, if anyone is interested in practicing this weekend or next, let me know and I will try to arrange it.

Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster Named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast: Recently I was honored to be selected as an outstanding Famous celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a chili cook-off, because no one else wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. Here are the scorecards from the event: Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick. JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. FRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy. Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang. JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously. FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face. Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans. JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers. FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk. Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming.  Rednecks! Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers. JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb. FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except big Sally. I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone! Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like stuff to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4 inch hole in my stomach. Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence. JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank. FRANK: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable To report) 
Hi Mom, Where are we staying in Telluride again?  I have been looking at some restaurants on telluride.org - it looks like they have some nice places. Maybe we should look into doing a sleigh ride or snowmobile dinner outing one night. 
Do you want to go to Austin tonight?  I have an extra ticket to the game tomorrow.  We will be back to Houston by 5 tomorrow. Let me know.

Mike, When (if :-) ) you have a minute could you do me a favour and send me an excel dump of all the deal numbers of GTMA Physical forwards we are expecting to settle for march production (27th to 1 April), with their projected volumes, the contract price, and the value?

Hey Michael, I just wanted to confirm my position on the team.  I know you have already talked to Luis Mena about putting together a team, and I would like to be on that team. Hopefully this year we can practice a little more and take home the championship. Hook 'em. Eric 
To whom it may concern: In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community. My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with regards to setting up the tournament? Thanks in advance, Eric Bass

This is to those of you who can make the game tonight.  Please try to get to the game as early as possible (6:15-6:30) so we can practice a little. We should have eight pending Luis' friend. Let me know if anything comes up between now and game time that we prevent

Gary, We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as possible.

Marge Ringer=20  BROWN: Major Applewhite was named the starter for the Colorado game on= =20 Tuesday by coach Mack Brown. Brown said Chris Simms would only be used on a= =20 ""need-to-win"" basis, meaning that for the first time this season, there is = no=20 plan to play both QBs this week. The coaches are hoping that by turning the= =20 offense over to Applewhite exclusively, there will be a spark. UT offensive= =20 coordinator Greg Davis said, however, that Texas could go back to the QB=20 rotation after this week. The coaches will wait and see. As far as other=20 promotions, B.J. Johnson will start at flanker ahead of Brandon Healy and R= oy=20 Williams will start at split end ahead of Montrell Flowers. The coaches mad= e=20 these promotions, in part, to help encourage Williams and Johnson to take= =20 more of a vocal leadership role.

[IMAGE] Kenny Hayter=20  Q:I'm having trouble understanding why the Longhorns will not put in a b= igger=20 running back during first and second down to increase their chances at a=20 third-and-short situation. I believe Hodges Mitchell is more of a third-dow= n=20 back who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is a= =20 guy who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards on= =20 first and second down. Watching the game last week and previous games as=20 well, I've noticed too many times that Texas has put itself in third and=20 long  situations due to not  picking up anything on the first two downs. Kenny Hayter, in my opinion,= is a=20 more physical back who doesn't go down as easy. They should put him in ther= e=20 on first and second down to pick up some positive yardage, and bring in=20 Hodges to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands an= d=20 is a reliable blocker. =20 ?? Eric Barker, Plano, Texas=20  BROWN: Texas got behind so early against Oklahoma that the running game= =20 became a moot point. Mack Brown said he should have run the ball more in th= e=20 second half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said h= e=20 was foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw= =20 and score quickly. Hayter took most of the first-team snaps in practice thi= s=20 week, so look for him to get more of a chance against Colorado.=20 ?   Q:What recruits were on the sideline for the OU game? =20 ?? Lance Kyles=20  BROWN: None. Texas was the visiting team. Only the home team is allowed = to=20 bring recruits to UT-OU game. So UT will be allowed to bring recruits to ne= xt=20 year's OU game.=20 ?   Q:Why did Kenny Hayter get only two carries? Why didn't our defense get= =20 pressure on Josh Heupel? Why do we run so many 5-yard patterns on offense?= =20 Give us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these  topics?= =20 ?? Cody Anderson, Houston=20  BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The runnin= g=20 game became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT wa= s=20 forced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot = of=20 time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and becaus= e=20 he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this= =20 week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference= ,=20 but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Roge= rs=20 was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,=20 according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the=20 defense is giving Texas. The coaches want the receivers to become more like= =20 running backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for bi= g=20 yards.=20 ?   Q:I began following Longhorn football when I arrived at UT in  1995, and= no=20 one was more shocked than me when the alumni and DeLoss Dodds  turned on Jo= hn=20 Mackovic so viciously after the loss to UCLA in 1997. Not only was I appall= ed=20 at the time, but I was even more horrified to learn that  this was par for= =20 the course for UT football coaches. Mack Brown seems to have been truly=20 embraced by the community over the last two years, but I'm  worried we are= =20 about to see a repeat of history. What do you think?=20 ?? Lisa Davis, Austin=20  BROWN: I was surprised at the venom being spit this week in and around= =20 Austin. People were talking about hiring John Mackovic as offensive=20 coordinator or bringing in Spike Dykes to talk to UT about how to respond= =20 after being blown out. All of this is crazy. Now, I will grant you that thi= s=20 game with Colorado is do-or-die as far as the Big 12 title. If UT loses it,= =20 the Horns will pretty much need the rest of the Big 12 South to fall apart = in=20 order to get into the league title game. But if UT wins, the Horns are real= ly=20 in the driver's seat for the Big 12 South title. I say that because the=20 chances of OU winning two of three against No. 1 Nebraska, No. 2 Kansas Sta= te=20 and at Texas A=02?are slim.

But the critical fans will also= =20 embrace Mack and move on. If Texas loses, I think people will be upset, but= =20 they will also need to get behind Mack Brown and start building support for= =20 the rest of this season and next season. Mack Brown isn't going anywhere.= =20 He'll be around Texas for a good while.=20 > ?     [IMAGE] Casey Hampton=20  Q:I know I have no right to criticize coaching because I don't have any = idea =20 what I would do in their situation. Having said that, I now must say that = =20 after a while, one begins to wonder about the coaching. You've said  numero= us=20 times that the coaches shouldn't be blamed for the Longhorns'  inconsistenc= y,=20 and most of the time I agree with you. However, this pattern  UT seems to= =20 follow amazes me. Every few games, everything just blows up and  we are=20 embarrassed. How can a team with such obviously great talent manage  to scr= ew=20 up horribly in random=20  games? My only thought is that it has to be  the coaching. It's not like= the=20 players aren't good enough. Kenny Hayter  proves in the OSU game to be the= =20 solution to the running game's problem.  Why replace him the next weekend i= n=20 a much bigger game with the truly  hard-working, but honestly inefficient= =20 Hodges Mitchell? Why run the ball  over and over when it obviously doesn't= =20 work? Or it could work, if the  right players were in... These things baffl= e=20 me. Do you think the coaching  is one of the problems? What can be done to= =20 fix the inconsistencies that  are actually becoming consistent and developi= ng=20 a pattern of embarrassing  losses? Last year there was N.C. State, and then= =20 the last three awful  games. This year, it's  mediocre Stanford, and the go= od=20 but not THAT good  OU. Will it ever stop? Thanks, I enjoy your newsletter.= =20 ?? David Rowe, Austin=20  BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma = got=20 it going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in t= o=20 slow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanc= he=20 was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense= .=20 Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I= =20 believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and t= he=20 offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has n= o=20 vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. B= ut=20 none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an=20 ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about wheth= er=20 he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.=20 Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You= =20 can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is= =20 inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey=20 Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trah= an=20 needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to= =20 step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.=20 ?   Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to = have=20 the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new =20 wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is=20 coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the= =20 play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On=20 defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and= =20 the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the sa= me=20 blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis= =20 seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mista= ke=20 or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some= =20 excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on t= he=20 sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU= =20 with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,=20 especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and=20 tendencies also?=20 ?? Todd Purl=20  BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating = his=20 play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas h= as=20 done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said jus= t=20 using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50= =20 with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line= =20 can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of bei= ng=20 balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up th= e=20 run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the= =20 coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten= =20 after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives= .=20 ?   Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- = be=20 realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and= =20 losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has= =20 said ""the other team just wanted it more"" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20 Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a= nd=20 Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? = Or=20 is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might = =20 for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20 ?? Mike Engelman=20  BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell= ing.=20 When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und= er=20 the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams= =20 like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(1998) and won. But now that T= exas=20 is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20 Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure= =20 there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with= =20 everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti= ng=20 star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b= e=20 expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h= e=20 has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th= e=20 Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have= =20 all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT= =20 had to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (= had=20 been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott= on=20 Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT= =20 in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop= e=20 of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over= =20 Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma= ke=20 his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership= =20 among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or=20 constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.=20 ?       [IMAGE] Greg Davis=20  Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20 thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is= =20 the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are= =20 offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20 better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last= =20 seven games (including this one) we have played against ""good"" defenses=20 (K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible= .=20 We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank   54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in th= e=20 country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th i= n=20 the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20 conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag= e=20 when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20 credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur= e=20 to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on= =20 this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa= s=20 on Saturday!  Thanks,=20 ?? Lane=20  BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi= t=20 more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down= ,=20 and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20 there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20 yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20 plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the=20 tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense=20 anymore.=20 ?   Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, = no-=20 huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come =20 alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Majo= r =20 Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford= , =20 the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense = =20 did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then= =20 when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why= =20 not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I=20 believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we a= ll=20 would  love to see a consistent running game.=20 ?? Brian Gannon=20  BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: ""The= =20 one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau= se=20 it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against= =20 using it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall philosop= hy=20 of being balanced, 50-50, with the run and the pass.""=20 ?  Q:The OU game was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish with no= =20 redeeming features  whatsoever which sets the program back at least a year,= =20 if not more. So tell us something good, Chip ... PLEASE! =20 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20  BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the dri= ver's=20 seat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas=20 doesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear= =20 hangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. F= or=20 every 1998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fal= l=20 into place as expected. But let's see what happens this week. The effects o= f=20 the OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. = If=20 UT bounces back this week and wins, the Longhorns have a pretty good schedu= le=20 to get to the A=02?game with only one league loss. Let's see what happens.= =20 ?   Q:You stated that every QB would benefit from a redshirt year unless the= y=20 were Michael Vick. Michael Vick redshirted at Virginia Tech and benefited= =20 greatly from it. It was even his idea. They made a pretty big deal about it= =20 last year.=20 ?? Brad Livingston=20  BROWN: I stand corrected. But even in my error, I proved my point. I sai= d all=20 freshmen benefit from a redshirt year, and Chris Simms probably would have,= =20 too. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for= =20 setting the record straight.=20 ?   Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the= =20 receivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely= =20 coincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but= =20 Applewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run= =20 on all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance= =20 to win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and=20 opponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surel= y=20 if Simms lives up to his pedigree as everyone hopes, he wouldn't have his= =20 feelings hurt if he lost the starting job to someone superior to him.=20 ?? Brandon May=20  BROWN: Simms said this week that if the coaches went solely with Applewh= ite,=20 he could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has= =20 been pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in his= =20 play. He said the grade he would give himself this season would be terrible= .=20 But he says, in his heart, he believes he will show everyone the promise th= at=20 has been expected of him since leaving high school as the nation's top QB= =20 prospect.=20 ?   Q:What role is Courtnee Garcia playing this year on the football team? I= s=20 Miguel McKay on the football team?=20 ?? Poorun Patel, Lufkin=20  BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the= =20 pre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And= =20 he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin= d=20 Nathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince= =20 the coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make th= e=20 most of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's= =20 position) behind Roy Williams and Montrell Flowers. Miguel McKay is on the= =20 team and got playing time at defensive tackle against OU. =20 ?   Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting= =20 restraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recrui= ts=20 that Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4= =20 years as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered = up=20 by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the= =20 next. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive=20 tackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where= =20 the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would= =20 guess that it has something to do with getting ""senior"" performance from=20 underclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I= =20 don't know. What do you think?=20 ?? Kevin P. McCarthy=20  BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with t= he=20 schedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without= =20 losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star= =20 high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 fr= om=20 then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 1= 0=20 and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving= =20 corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the= =20 O-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have= =20 all its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will los= e=20 two first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcu= s=20 Tubbs and Stevie Lee should be suitable replacements. The senior leadership= =20 in other areas will have to make up for the loss of this year's key seniors= .=20 ?   Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the= =20 offense because he is a big-play receiver. As a supporter of the Garland=20 Owls, I got to witness B.J. Johnson in a big-game situation in last year's= =20 semi-final game. He was an awesome player last year until that semi-final= =20 game. Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams? =20 ?? Tyrance ""Duke"" Barnett, Garland, Texas=20  BROWN: I think both of these guys will be outstanding. And more importan= tly,=20 their leadership will be needed on this offense beginning Saturday. As Mack= =20 Brown says, freshmen are only freshmen until mid-season. Then they have to = be=20 and play like upperclassmen. But Williams and Johnson will both be=20 outstanding, in my opinion.=20 ?   Q:Mack Brown should be HEAVILY criticized for his poor handling of the Q= B=20 situation. Major Applewhite has never done anything but show he is one of t= he=20 most confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my=20 opinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps= =20 in the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can= =20 say what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would= =20 not have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the=20 entire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to th= e=20 level they're capable of playing because of the inconsistency at QB. A QB= =20 controversy creates doubt and a lack of confidence for everyone involved. T= he=20 coaches, media and fans have fallen in love with an unproven commodity, all= =20 the while shucking aside an individual who did everything possible to prove= =20 he should be the starter. Mack Brown's job is to be above that, and it's ti= me=20 for him to take the heat. The media and fans are touching on this, but I=20 think it's time to tell it like it is with his illogical, failed and unfair= =20 experiment.=20 ?? Jason Stone=20  BROWN: Amen, Jason. You have spoken, and the rotation has come to an end= . At=20 least for this week.=20 ?   Q:Is there a start time for the Missouri game on Oct. 21?=20 ??=20  BROWN: Not yet. ABC has opted to use its 6-day window to determine which= =20 games it will televise that weekend. Right now, it's possible that the game= =20 could be at 2:30 p.m., 6 p.m. or 1 p.m. It definitely will not be at 11 a.m= .=20 Stay tuned.=20   If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscrib= e,=20 sign up at:   Newsletter Registration=20  To find or change your password, modify your account, or unsubscribe fro= m=20 this newsletter, go to:   Newsletter Registration =20  Questions?

Waxer, Dallas=20   BROWN:  Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and= =20 Texas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is= a=20 good chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20 would start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th= en=20 the focus would turn to the south end.=20 ?       [IMAGE]=20 Kalen Thornton =20  Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20 ?? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20   BROWN:  Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator= Carl=20 Reese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron= =20 would be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas= =20 wants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20 Thornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20 considering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv= e=20 tackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see= =20 playing time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future = by=20 holding him out this season.=20  ?    Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the= =20 second half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a  question= =20 about the punt team.=20  It's obvious that opposing teams'  philosophy is to not call ""fair catch= ."" I=20 first noticed this against  Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that= =20 making an early tackle by  invading the ""halo"" and receiving a 5-yard penal= ty=20 is much better than  sitting back and possibly allowing a big return.  But if we're going to  get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po= p the=20 receiver in the  mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would= =20 make that  penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20 ?? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20   BROWN:  No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t= he=20 penalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor= th=20 and give that returner something to remember for next time.=20  I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that= =20 against a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20 Allen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the= =20 5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.= =20 ?

(I= =20 am out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20 ?? Jerry Secrets=20   BROWN:  No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g= ame.=20 The running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking= =20 angles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl= ay=20 side was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the= =20 team had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last= =20 Saturday, it did.=20 ?    Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20 ?? Rick Bush, Dallas=20   BROWN:  I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s= till=20 seen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h= e=20 and the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi= gh=20 ankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however.

Do you feel that Texas' young secondar= y can=20 answer the call? =20  ?? Marty Wagner=20   BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v= s.=20 UT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20 secondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20  Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i= s=20 back, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to= =20 free safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which= =20 in this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as= =20 possible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20 D-backs.=20 ?    Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the = keys?=20 ?? Sara Wilson=20   BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla= ys=20 the best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun= =20 Rogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion= =20 of the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft= er=20 picking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.= =20 ?    Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex= as,=20 do you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU= ?=20 Also (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue= ),=20 do you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat= e=20 IF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20  My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major= =20 Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which = he=20 obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba= ck=20 at the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven= 't=20 seen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20  ?? Clint Mickey=20   BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti= ons=20 with the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20 doesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos= t=20 or all of the next two games.=20  If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games= =20 because UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still= =20 be winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are= all=20 about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on= =20 Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20 having two starting quarterbacks.=20  I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he= had=20 been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes= t=20 player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t= he=20 best QB on your own team.=20  As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20 continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20 season. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms= =20 gets injured.=20 ?       [IMAGE]=20 Major Applewhite =20  Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi= te=20 has established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. = It=20 has become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks ""starters"" and insist on=20 token starts for Chris Simms.=20  It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as= THE=20 starter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead= =20 of allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w= ho=20 then plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. = As=20 fine as Simms' =20  talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20   BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't= =20 realize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi= on=20 of confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon= d=20 half against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20 rotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20 maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20 ?    Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece= nt=20 success after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan= d=20 is why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20 superior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really= =20 hurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? = =20 ?? Chad Dieterichs=20   BROWN:  It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w= ay=20 too much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20 matter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses= =20 onto Stockton's pocket?=20  Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t= hat=20 they use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams= =20 are prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit= =20 special teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20 veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20  I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t= o=20 have a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He= =20 said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w= as=20 the result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the= =20 assignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu= gh=20 the middle of the line.=20 ?   Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re= alize=20 what this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20 wonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20 O-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20  Guess what? Most of these ""great"" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as= a=20 freshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi= th=20 current players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game = or=20 two this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no= =20 biggie.=20  In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w= ill=20 it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college= =20 programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and= =20 we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20 direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a= =20 true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20 ?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20   BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin= t.=20 The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line= s=20 has to have experience, and there have to be some ""Braveheart""-type leaders= =20 on the team.=20  Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two= =20 seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.= =20 So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a= =20 couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national= =20 championship.=20  But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in= stead=20 of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the= =20 Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex= as=20 will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20  Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20 included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20 State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20 recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In= =20 the next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard = as=20 the perennial powers.=20 ?    Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha= ve=20 the longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at= =20 NEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession= al=20 help? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel= =20 guilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20 ?? Arland Bishop=20   BROWN:  Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating = back=20 to a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak = in=20 the nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20  Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. = The=20 only non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games= =20 are New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora= do=20 in Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl= e=20 Field.=20  So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should= be=20 another reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20 obviously on the horizon.=20 ?    Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear= d=20 this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling= =20 early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course= ).=20 They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20 barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down= =20 and let him do his magic.=20  It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m= ore=20 balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear= ly=20 and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.= =20  I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the= m.=20 The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig= ht=20 when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove= =20 straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (= at=20 least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was= =20 probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major= =20 in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so= =20 far).=20  I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU= has=20 done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20 Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20 one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability= -=20 his mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th= e=20 shotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic= k=20 with him. =20 ?? Aaron Ruhnow=20   BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci= fic=20 situations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense= =20 that can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills= =20 used it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca= n=20 do a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20 ?    Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go= ing=20 to be too much for Mack Brown to handle? It appears he is already crumbling= .=20 If he thinks people are hammering him now, what will it be like if he drops= =20 this year's game to A=02?and suffers four losses?=20 ?? Mike McDonald=20   BROWN:  : I hope it won't be too much for Mack Brown. He's a good perso= n and=20 works really hard. I think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove= r=20 him and forget about it. I think he has gotten into a rut lately where he= =20 senses that every question has negative overtones. So now he is answering= =20 every question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of remark.=20  He has done more for Texas than UT will ever know. He has reshaped the= =20 mindset of the university with the positive outlook he has brought to the= =20 football team. Games are selling out. Players are coming to Austin. The kid= s,=20 for the most part, are good kids.=20  There's no need for Mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega= tive=20 voices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made= .=20 If he moves on, the media and the critics will move on, too. If he harps on= =20 criticism and keeps bringing it up in his answers, the media has no=20 alternative but to report it. It becomes a wicked circle.=20 ?    Q: David Aaron was a receiver that came out of Marshall a few years bac= k. I=20 know he also went to UT for track but he was a great receiver in high schoo= l.=20 I saw him on the sidelines a few times but he never got much playing time. = I=20 was thinking he should be a senior this year. Do you know what ever happene= d=20 to him?=20 ?? Jeff, Marshall, Texas=20   BROWN:  Aaron is just running track this year. He has left the football= =20 team.=20 ?    Q: Is it just me , or does the football field look a little bit torn up= ? It=20 just looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown up.=20 ?? Mark V.=20   BROWN:  UT officials say it's the drought and the fact that the UT team= =20 practices on the field on Thursdays. But, I agree. I think the field looks= =20 worse this season than it did last season (and we had a drought and the tea= m=20 practiced on it last year, too).=20 ?    Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns= have=20 been getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii= =20 game to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in= =20 the U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high= =20 school stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a football= =20 game.  I'm not sure about Dallas, but here in Houston Mack and Co. have been ge= tting=20 drilled for everything I listed above and more (QB rotation). It just seems= =20 like everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20 something negative to heap on the program.  In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, = his=20 coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit= h=20 the media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted= =20 about their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do= =20 you have any thoughts as to why this is occurring? Hook 'em. =20 ?? Marty Murray, Class of '82, Baytown, Texas=20   BROWN:  It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth= ing=20 up, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20 storybook season of 1998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t= oo=20 big of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t= o=20 burst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20 
that's fine, 3212. 
ok, can I come by at 11:15?  you're at 3212, right? Eric Bass@ECT 10/04/2000 05:05 PM 
yeah, it would probably be better to do it later in the day. preferably after 11:00 
hehe!  Thanks!  what time do you usually get here in the morning?  are your morning's hectic? Eric Bass@ECT 10/04/2000 04:55 PM 
is a penny good enough? just kidding, i'll give $25 
yeah, it does seem like the weeks get longer and longer... Everything's going well.  Same old stuff, you know?  Matt's been out of town a lot lately, so that's no fun.  Plus, he's unhappy w/a few things that are going on at work.  Plus, he's tired of traveling, so he's looking for a job here.  We'll see... You owe me whatever you want to give.  $25 gets you a T-shirt, but whatever amount is fine. Eric Bass@ECT 10/04/2000 04:01 PM 
Hey Allison, Not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend.  It seems like the weeks get longer and longer, doesn't it? How are things in your world? You can come by whenever you want to get the check.  How much do I owe you again? Eric

solid blue is the outermost track - dashe blue is the internal projection for its path 
What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job - mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's tax cuts going to the ""wealthiest one percent"".   That is the biggest load of garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back. 
congrats on the new position - I just heard Enron North America Corp. 
Are you coming to the game tonight?

I received an invitation in the mail to purchase Rockets tickets online 2 days earlier than they go on sale to the general public.  The opener is Tues 10/31 at 7:30 PM vs. the T-Wolves.    I know how much you guys like sitting in the cheap seats, so you can listen to comments such as ""I'm gonna let you hear it-AIRBALL!,"" and ""He just made Sportscenter.""  If you want to go to the game let me know  and I will buy the tickets this week.
