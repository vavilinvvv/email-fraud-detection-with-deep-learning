John, You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid. Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality. The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. As Bias increases, the Offset increases. I'll call later to see what you think of the idea. Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be: Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last [Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product. Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow. Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4]. #Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred. #Sells - The number of Sells which have occured. Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).} Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs. Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs. Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1. Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to 1. Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.04] Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.50] Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0]. Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0.50] Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A possible value for this might be [0.01] Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds. Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula: Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended.

We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus. The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case: Week of Jan 14: Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"". A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users. The Splash page will look something like the following: 
We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, Dave Forster 713.853.1861 
With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.

Effective immediately, there is a change to the Stack Manager which will affect Inactive Children. Inactive Children with links to Parent products will not have their calculated prices updated until the Child product is Activated. When the Child Product is activated, the price will be recalculated and updated BEFORE it is displayed on the web. This means that if you are inputting a basis price on a Child product, you will not see the final, calculated price until you Activate the product, at which time the customer will also see it.

Introduction In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products. This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade. Summary of New Features Multiple Children - A ""Child"" product can be the ""Parent"" of another Child (multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed against a single Parent. Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and hit the ""+"" or ""-"" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in Product Properties until you logout. Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your ""shift"" key. Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: ""Basis Link - Parent"" and now would say ""Stand Alone, Parent""). Detailed Feature Descriptions Multiple Children The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C. Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a customer attempts a transaction, the database must ""lock"" each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks. ""Vertical"" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are much slower to process than ""Flat"" chains (One parent with many children). Large vertical chains should be avoided. Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated Basis link and a regular Basis Link. Static Product Bar Prices The new version of EnronOnline provides for ""sticky"" Product Bar price and volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the ""+"" or ""-"" buttons. One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate. You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu. Sorting/Selecting The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in alphabetical order). If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort criteria, plus you can select ""Sort by Web Order"", which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing). When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another. Parent Products and F/X Products One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product. Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now identified with a stylised ""fx"" in the Product list. This is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the parent, rather than managed individually. Assistance As always, if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality, please contact the 24 hour Help Desk (Houston: 713 853 4357, London: +44 (0) 20 7783 7783, Australia: +61 2 9229 2300). General Feedback If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager. 
Password Deletion It has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar to their User ID's for internal EnronOnline applications (Stack Manager, Product Manager, EOL Reports). This is a significant security concern. Therefore, there will be a sweep of ID's and passwords at the end of the day on Thursday, April 5. Any User ID's which have passwords similar to the User ID will be subject to deletion. Changing Your Password Passwords can be changed in either the Stack Manager or in EOL Reports. To change your password in the Stack Manager, once logged on, go to toolbar & select ""Help"" and then select ""Change Password"". The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice. To change your passsword in EOL Reports, open the Reports application, log in, select ""Options"" and ""Change Password"".The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice. Please note that the password change functionality within the Reports application is new. If it does not appear on your menu and you are running on a standalone machine, you will need to logout at the windows level and then login again to receive the updated version. If you have any questions, please call the EnronOnline Help Desk (Houston: 713 853 4357,  London: + 44 20 7783 7783) Thank you for your assistance in preserving appropriate security. 
There is a new version of Stack Manager which is being released this evening, for use on Monday morning. Changes 1) ""Inactivate Suspended Children"" - New menu item available by right-clicking on a Parent Product. It will change all Child Products of the highlighted parent from ""Suspended"" to ""Inactive"". Note that this will be applied only to the product which you highlight. It will also show available when highlighting Products which are not Parents, but it will have no effect. 2) The transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those transactions completed on the calendar day (problem has affected Australia and Singapore). 3) A Constant Spread which is changed from the front page of the Stack Manager will stay as changed for that Product. The spread will persist even if transactions occur. Background Suspended Child Products continue to have their prices updated as the price of the Parent changes. Inactive Child Products do not have their prices updated. The price update process slows down EnronOnline processing and Stack Manager response, so it is advantageous to ensure all non-active Products are in an Inactive state. If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline call center at: North America: 713 853 4357 (HELP) Asia and Australia: +61 2 9229 2300 Europe and Other Regions: +44 (0) 20 7783 7783 
We are pleased to announce that as of Monday, Sept. 18, the new version of EnronOnline will be launched to all our customers.

Introduction In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products. This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade. Summary of New Features Multiple Children - A ""Child"" product can be the ""Parent"" of another Child (multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed against a single Parent. Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and hit the ""+"" or ""-"" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in Product Properties until you logout. Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your ""shift"" key. Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: ""Basis Link - Parent"" and now would say ""Stand Alone, Parent""). Detailed Feature Descriptions Multiple Children The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C. Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a customer attempts a transaction, the database must ""lock"" each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks. ""Vertical"" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are much slower to process than ""Flat"" chains (One parent with many children). Large vertical chains should be avoided. Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated Basis link and a regular Basis Link. Static Product Bar Prices The new version of EnronOnline provides for ""sticky"" Product Bar price and volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the ""+"" or ""-"" buttons. One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate. You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu. Sorting/Selecting The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in alphabetical order). If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort criteria, plus you can select ""Sort by Web Order"", which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing). When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another. Parent Products and F/X Products One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product. Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now identified with a stylised ""fx"" in the Product list. This is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the parent, rather than managed individually. Assistance As always, if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality, please contact the 24 hour Help Desk (Houston: 713 853 4357, London: +44 (0) 20 7783 7783, Australia: +61 2 9229 2300). General Feedback If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager.

We are pleased to announce that as of Monday, Sept. 18, the new version of EnronOnline will be launched to all our customers. When our customers log in on this day, they will be given the option to upgrade to the new version. They can choose to immediately upgrade, or to upgrade at a later time. If the customers choose to upgrade, they will be taken through the same steps as when you upgraded. If the customers choose not to upgrade, they will receive a version of EnronOnline which is the same as the ""old"" version, but the colors will be blue, instead of black. Customers who choose not to immediately upgrade can can do so at a later time by pressing the ""Upgrade to Version 2"" button in the top left corner of their screen. Some customers may have browser or firewall restrictions which could cause difficulties in upgrading to the new version of EnronOnline. We have EnronOnline Help Desk and IT troubleshooters standing by to help anyone in this situation. For assistance, please direct calls to: North America 713 853 4357 Europe  + 44 20 7783 7783 Australia/Asia + 61 2 9229 2300 EnronOnline marketing personnel will be calling customers to help guide them through the new features, but it would be appreciated if you could also point out some of the new features when you are talking to your customers. As of Monday, all internal users should also use the usual www.enrononline.com to get to the new version. Thank you for your assistance in making EnronOnline a success. 
There is a new version of Stack Manager which is being released this evening, for use on Monday morning. Changes 1) ""Inactivate Suspended Children"" - New menu item available by right-clicking on a Parent Product. It will change all Child Products of the highlighted parent from ""Suspended"" to ""Inactive"". Note that this will be applied only to the product which you highlight. It will also show available when highlighting Products which are not Parents, but it will have no effect. 2) The transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those transactions completed on the calendar day (problem has affected Australia and Singapore). 3) A Constant Spread which is changed from the front page of the Stack Manager will stay as changed for that Product. The spread will persist even if transactions occur. Background Suspended Child Products continue to have their prices updated as the price of the Parent changes. Inactive Child Products do not have their prices updated. The price update process slows down EnronOnline processing and Stack Manager response, so it is advantageous to ensure all non-active Products are in an Inactive state. If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline call center at: North America: 713 853 4357 (HELP) Asia and Australia: +61 2 9229 2300 Europe and Other Regions: +44 (0) 20 7783 7783

At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated Basis link and a regular Basis Link. Static Product Bar Prices The new version of EnronOnline provides for ""sticky"" Product Bar price and volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the ""+"" or ""-"" buttons. One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate. You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu. Sorting/Selecting The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in alphabetical order). If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort criteria, plus you can select ""Sort by Web Order"", which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing). When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another. Parent Products and F/X Products One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product. Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now identified with a stylised ""fx"" in the Product list. This is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the parent, rather than managed individually. Assistance As always, if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality, please contact the 24 hour Help Desk (Houston: 713 853 4357, London: +44 (0) 20 7783 7783, Australia: +61 2 9229 2300). General Feedback If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager. 
Introduction In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products. This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade. Summary of New Features Multiple Children - A ""Child"" product can be the ""Parent"" of another Child (multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed against a single Parent. Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and hit the ""+"" or ""-"" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in Product Properties until you logout. Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your ""shift"" key. Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: ""Basis Link - Parent"" and now would say ""Stand Alone, Parent""). Detailed Feature Descriptions Multiple Children The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C. Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a customer attempts a transaction, the database must ""lock"" each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks. ""Vertical"" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are much slower to process than ""Flat"" chains (One parent with many children). Large vertical chains should be avoided. Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent Product B.

There is a new version of Stack Manager which is being released this evening, for use on Monday morning. Changes 1) ""Inactivate Suspended Children"" - New menu item available by right-clicking on a Parent Product. It will change all Child Products of the highlighted parent from ""Suspended"" to ""Inactive"". Note that this will be applied only to the product which you highlight. It will also show available when highlighting Products which are not Parents, but it will have no effect. 2) The transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those transactions completed on the calendar day (problem has affected Australia and Singapore). 3) A Constant Spread which is changed from the front page of the Stack Manager will stay as changed for that Product. The spread will persist even if transactions occur. Background Suspended Child Products continue to have their prices updated as the price of the Parent changes. Inactive Child Products do not have their prices updated. The price update process slows down EnronOnline processing and Stack Manager response, so it is advantageous to ensure all non-active Products are in an Inactive state. If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline call center at: North America: 713 853 4357 (HELP) Asia and Australia: +61 2 9229 2300 Europe and Other Regions: +44 (0) 20 7783 7783

We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"". We have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus. Our planned Re-Launch timetable is as follows: Week of Jan 14: Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with the new Buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"". A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Subusers. 
With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned. UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts: For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, Dave Forster 713.853.1861

We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus. The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case: Week of Jan 14: Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"". A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users. The Splash page will look something like the following: 
With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.

David, Thanks for the info. Could you address the following questions? 1) Do you have a redlined version of the GTC, highlighting changes from what is online? 2) You mention: ""Counterparties from other countries will require specific tax clearance"" - could you explain what this process will be? 3) Could you please confirm that Australia does not have a Double Taxation Agreement with: Argentina Brazil Canada Croatia Germany Japan Netherlands Poland Portugal Romania Singapore Slovenia (note these are all countries which have PA's under EnronOnline or are expected to have PA's very soon) 4) 1.5: Reasonableness Test: ""a determination needs to be made whether inviting them to trade Australian Power could lead to a claim of misleading/deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act 1974.""  Can you make this determination or indicate how we can make this determination? 5) 1.2 Regulatory Obligations: ""Confirm that counterparty will trade as principal."" In your opinion,does Clause 2(a) of the ETA sufficiently address this concern? Thanks for your help, Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/31/2000 08:58 AM 
Attached are the GTCs that I have revised to address tax issues that would arise from counterparties with no Australia presence. I am content settlement provisions already covered in the documentation. I have also developed a checklist for new counterparties. Would you pass onto Chris Catt at PW for his signoff. 
Tana, As discussed, I would appreciate it if you could send a bilateral NDA out for RBC later today. We will be discussing the possibility of Royal Bank posting FX products on EnronOnline.

I assume each person is taking appropriate action with regard to disabling user ID's and/or adjusting credit limits accordingly . . . Dave 
Tana, Can you coordinate with David on the procedures? Thanks, Dave 
David, Thanks for the new GTC. We'll get things rolling at our end for the upload of new GTC and customer profiles. I think the ABN number might be better suited to the Registration form . . . Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/30/2000 10:32 PM 
Attached is the revised GTCs that address taxation issues for non-Australian resident counterparties. These GTCs have received tax clearance and hence all approvals have now been given to allow them to be loaded. Enclosed also are the procedures that need to be followed when new counterparties are being considered. To date we have been vetting potential counteparties in the Sydney office. I suggest that the procedures be made available to anyone else who may be given this responsibility. One new matter has come to light. In July 2000 with the introduction of GST in Australia new legislative arrangements will come into place. They will require businesses to have an ""ABN"". It has been suggested that we amend the password application to request the counterparty's ABN. 
Carol, - Do we really want to accept arbitration in Portland? - What is our exposure to Federal Law? Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/11/2000 10:05 AM 
David: Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
Approved. . . .and it wasn't a big deal - you're still debt-free. :) Dave 
- Paragraph 3: Same concern as in last email. - Paragraph 4: Are we happy to forego the application of the liabilities clause whenever a Counterparty does a transaction under a Master agreement, instead of a GTC? Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/11/2000 07:12 PM 
David: Enclosed is a new draft of the Kennecott amendment letter.  Mark and I have discussed the counterparty termination language and have come up with the language that I have high;lighted.  Upon your approval, I plan to use the same language for the Duke and Cinnergy letters. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Fine with me. Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/30/2000 09:48 AM 
Dave: Per my voice mail message, this entity would like to sign the same amendment letter that kinder Morgan signed which I have attached.  Please let me know if this is okay with you.  Thanks. 
Tana, We are using Livelink now for document storage within Product Control. Do you store documents electronically as well? Dave 
Tana, Can you confirm the status of the amendment with Crestar? Thanks, Dave 
We have reached $100 Billion. Please come to Jay's office at 3:30 to receive a small gift. If you work with the Valtech (Mike's group) or Luminant people (Chris' group), please ensure they know that they are invited. Thanks, 
Tana, Do you have a copy of this stuff? Carol St. Clair worked on the issue. Thanks, Dave 
I don't suppose you could send me what we have used in the US?  Edmund David Forster@ENRON 07/26/2000 08:53 PM 
OK with me in this instance. They should be supplied with our termination phone number and termination language used as previously constructed (I think we have done this before in the UK? If not, we have in the U.S.) Dave Edmund Cooper@ECT 07/26/2000 09:39 AM 
Dear Dave, I hope all is well with you! I have spoken with Dick Stoppe of Dow Benelux regarding issues they have with the ETA.  He told me that their lawyer has pointed out a variety of issues relating to the one-sidedness of the ETA.  However, Dow are prepared to accept the terms of the ETA if the termination clause 6(a) is made mutual.  I explained that they could stop trading if they were unhappy for whatever reason, but in such an eventuality their preference is not to have the ETA continuing in force.  I have no problems with this but obviously this needs your blessing to proceed. Thanks, Edmund 
ed - could you drop hin a call, ta j 
Justin, I have spoken to you a couple of weeks ago about Dow having inquiries about Enron Online and the termination clause. I have told them what you have told me, but they nevertheless would like to talk to you. Dick Stoppe told me that he tried to give you a call but apparently he hasn't heard anything back. Can you pls give them a call: 004117282144 Dow is one of the most important and biggest customer so I really would like to get them on board 
Tana, It looks like there are changes on this against the online ETA which are not redlined. Do you have any other information about these changes? (I'd like to avoid having to do a line-by-line comparison. Thanks, Dave 
Tana, Thanks for the redlined version. I have a number of concerns about this document. I'm not sure who is handling in Carol's absence? - 2(g): If Offers are warranted by Enron, then what are we warranting? I'm not comfortable with this. - 3(a): The Master Agreement does not control. The Long Descriptions need to override the Masters where required. This is common practice OTC. - 3(d): I don't understand why we are amending this. - 4(a): This is probably OK, but it doesn't sit right - would appreciate some legal comments. - 5(c): Why are we changing this? - 6(b): We do not do reciprocal assignments. If they don't like who we assign to, they can cease using the system. - 6 (h): I think some words are missing here. Dave 
It has come to my attention that when we have a Financial Master Agreement in place, we have identified that a Master exists for the Weather Products. This is not correct as the ISDA Masters do not properly cover weather. For Weather transactions, we need to use either the GTC or a weather-specific Master Agreement. Frank: Could you please arrange to identify which companies have already transacted on weather and have done so ostensibly under an ISDA?  Could you please also coordinate with Mark as necessary to update Customer Profiles so that customers with ISDA's will need to accept GTC's? If we have customers who have ostensibly transacted already under their ISDA's, let's identify who they are and then decide on a course of action for their profiles. Thanks, Dave

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, Dave Forster 713.853.1861

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, Dave Forster 713.853.1861 
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus. The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case: Week of Jan 14: Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"". A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users. The Splash page will look something like the following: 
With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned. UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts: For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

Louise, I have looked at this opportunity and am of the opinion that the expense of $7 million will not provide cost effective advertising or dealmaking benefits for Origination particularly or EWS generally. I will advise M3 Management (the marketing consultant for Team Rahal) that we will not be participating. 
You asked me to look into this (the Ford sponsorship thing). I think they will be unlikely to deliver on the benefits promised by M3 Management (their marketing consultant) and will add little value to our dealmaking opportunities with Ford. I will pass the info. along to EES to see if they have any interest in paying the $7 million for general advertising exposure. 
Louise, It is possible that ABB will raise the subject of our option with them for the construction of the HVDC tie while in our meeting tomorrow. As you know, we paid a considerable sum in the past for this option, which effectively expires at the end of November. Under current market conditions, I think it will be possible to pay a much lower sum - and in fact, I think we can apply this sum against the ABB contracted project cost in the event we proceed. No decisions are needed on this tomorrow, and it might not even come up - but clearly, we've kept these guys hanging on the line for some time now and I expect that realistically we will not be in a position to give them a Notice to Proceed until middle of next year, given contracting and Presidential Permit issues. 
No action needed on your part, but just in case you hear something through the grapevine, here is current situation: Summary - AEP/CP&L have economic interests in the Brownsville area which are best served if we do not locate our tie in Brownsville Public Utility Board's (BPUB's) service territory and BPUB does not obtain the  system upgrades which would be justified by our tie. - AEP is trying to stall our Presidential Permit Application and to coerce us into moving the tie onto their system. - BPUB sees this as an attack on their interests and is planning to challenge AEP. - 5 MOU's have been signed with customers and discussions are continuing with 12 others, who have all been met and have expressed interest. - We are optimistic that the PP will be issued and standard Ercot treatments will prevail, but we will likely be delayed to sometime early next year. History - Enron filed Presidential Permit (PP) Application - CP&L (owned by AEP) intervened against the application and raised some technical issues - DOE asked Enron and CP&L/AEP to meet and resolve issues - Meeting occurred between Enron and CP&L/AEP. General technical solutions were identified, with specific solutions to be determined through a SPS study. - Enron drafted a letter outlining the points covered in our meeting with CP&L/AEP, intending to have the letter signed by both of us and forwarded to DOE, requesting that DOE proceed with issuing the PP. - AP&L/AEP refused to sign the letter and are now arguing that an SPS scheme is not sufficient for the proposed tie location (although AEP operates under SPS elsewhere within Ercot, they argue that ours is a special case. Independent opinion (and our own) is that there is little merit to the CP&L/AEP position). - AEP have told us that if we move the tie to a location West of Brownsville (on AEP's proposed line expansion), that they would drop all opposition. - AEP/CP&L have since approached the Ercot Board arguing that cost studies should be done on alternate tie locations and the system cost impact thereof. - AEP/CP&L have submitted to the Ercot Board that Enron should be responsible for any costs associated building the tie at anything other than the least-cost (system perspective) location. Current Status - Brownsville (BPUB) are incensed at AEP/CP&L's behaviour and are planning the following actions: - Making submission to Ercot that: -  BPUB informed Ercot of the project 14 months ago and no further studies or committee reviews by Ercot should be necessary. - No changes to current Ercot procedures should be contemplated and the tie should be viewed as a firm, native BPUB load - BPUB lawyer is drafting letter to go to AEP demanding that AEP honor their previous agreement with BPUB to be supportive of BPUB projects. - BPUB CEO, engineer and lawyer will visit PUC-T next week to make the case that no special arrangements should be made with regard to Enron or BPUB 	needing to pick up additional system costs - At this point, BPUB is highly motivated and is striking out with an aggressive representation of their position as there are implications for them which go beyond the current project. Furthermore, there is little love lost between BPUB and AEP. - Although moving to the AEP-proposed location would remove AEP as an obstacle, we would lose the work done to date preparing with BPUB and would probably make an enemy of BPUB. 
We finally connected. Beau Normark (sp?), ABB President is coming for a visit to the local ABB office and wants to meet with Enron as part of a general meet n' greet (as suspected). They don't have any particular agenda in mind, but will probably want to talk a bit about the business relationship Enron and ABB have enjoyed in the past, our current projects (e.g. TexMex) and any plans we might care to share about the future. 
Omigod. Shall I bow down upon entering your office? Only #17, though . . .  clearly Marcus was not polled! :) http://www.fortune.com/index.jhtml?%2Ffortune%2Fuser_session.channel=Home&_D%3A%2Ffortune%2Fuser_session.channel=+&person_id=&search_type=&channel=&co_id=&list_frag=&channel_temp=Home&prev_list=&txtSearchFortune=Search&txtSearchQuote=Get+Quote&fortune_list=22&_D%3Afortune_list=+&left_range_value=1&_D%3Aleft_range_value=+&bottom25=976&disp=yes&_DARGS=%2Fgl_left_nav.jhtml 
Louise, I understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the Lincoln Electric Sales Agreement to OPPD is not sufficient to justify paying $1.3 million to OPPD in order for them to assume this contract. There are some considerations on this contract which I think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you: - The original sales contract to Lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as ""toxic waste"". - About a month ago, we agreed verbally with OPPD to accept assignment of the sales contract, as OPPD is one of the few parties which can serve it. - The execution of the documents has been delayed by Lincoln, who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment - We have another, larger under-water transaction with OPPD which we would like to move off the books at some point. We'd like to keep OPPD happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them) - If we fail to deliver, we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $45,0000 per MW on top of Liquidated Damages (Lincoln is 15 MW for 02 and 30 MW for 03). - This is a highly constrained area (only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and OPPD is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve Lincoln): the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high. - There is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where Enron fails to deliver. - Even if we do wind up serving the contract, the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire. - Trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve (day-ahead notice on 20% monthly load factor) Obviously, if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now, then we will smooth things as much as possible with OPPD - but I wanted to make sure you had all the info. before we kill the deal. Terri has stalled OPPD until Monday. 
Louise, - Please let me know if you want me to push for Karen's involvement in the Origination track. When you have a moment, would appreciate some time to go over some or all of the following: - EES approach/response - Update on TexMex - My various homework assignments (Origination Track, brownbag lunches, new contact mgmt system, etc.) - Realistic expectation of MidWest earnings in Q4 (I know I'm already hung, but what the heck). - Some ideas for elephants - General catch up Thanks, 
Was originally passed to me from you. Is a time-waster and is threatening to call you again. See me if you want details. 
In March, Mark Bernstein of EES asked us not to contact EGI (Pa utility) as they were ""doing a deal with them"". After waiting for about two months, we contacted UGI as part of a general sweep of utilities to introduce our new wholesale services team. At that time, it became apparant that EES had been offering them a full requirements transaction. I am told that UGI is not in a deregulated area where it would be possible to pass individual customers over to another entity and when we met with them, they stated that they had no intention of passing any of their customers to any other entity. As a sidenote, since that meeting, EES was apparantly very annoyed that we ""screwed up their deal"" with UGI (presumably by meeting with them). Rumour has it a conversation took place between Dave Delainey and Dave Duran on this subject, but I have not confirmed the details with Dave Duran yet. 
I have asked some of the originators to supply me with information re: EES approaching their customers. So far, I have received the following, all of which have occurred within the last few months: 1) Citgo Refining - Last month, we provided pricing for a facility in IL.  The customer indicated he already had a non-competitive bid from EES. 2) AE Staley - the customer indicated he had recently been dealing with a representative from Enron Direct.  This was rectified when the rep left Enron last month. 3) Dow, Air Products, Praxair - EES spoke to them about a put option. 4) Abitibi, Shintech, Alcoa, Solutia, Kinder Morgan have all been approached by EES. 
Louise, Attached is the list with the names as I have been able to assemble so far. If I can get more info. before our meeting, I will add it. Note I have removed Entergy. There is some background to this. Please see me if you want details. Dave 
Louise, I have reformatted the list to show breakdown by customer type and added some more details for the power customers. I have not been able to obtain more detail from the gas guys. Please let me know if this is closer to what you are looking for or if you need further info. before the meeting. 
Examples of EES working in ENA territory seem to keep coming. Anything further on this? 
We discovered today that they are talking to them, too. Any word on whether or not I can approach EES on the subject? 
THIS EMAIL CONTAINS THE OLD PA AND ETA VERSIONS. NEW VERSIONS ARE BEING DRAFTED. Louise, As discussed, there are a few items for which we will need the approval of the new Buyer as soon as possible, in order to ensure we are able to proceed with a relaunch of EnronOnline (NETCoOnline) without delay. Two of the items for which we need approval as soon as possible are the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA), which work together to provide electronic trading access to the products available on NetcoOnline. Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years. Contracts Structure There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online. PassWord Application (PA) The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs. The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check. Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place. General Terms and Conditions (GTC) When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply. Password Application: Electronic Trading Agreement: 
OK - here's the sort of thing I am thinking of (still needs Kal's magic). I suspect you were thinking of a pop-up notice. Given that we aren't really showing anything on EnronOnline at the moment, I suggest we take down EnronOnline entirely and replace it with a splash page which says something like the following: COMING SOON Enron is working with potential industry partners to assemble a new venture which will combine Enron's trading and market - making expertise with the financial strength and reliability of an A rated entity. Upon formation of this new company, we anticipate that we will be able to announce the launch of a new trading platform for North American gas and power, providing services similar to those previously available on EnronOnline. Please check back with this site for future updates on plans for the new trading platform. 
Louise, Since our conversation today, I have discovered that by terminating the Reuters contract, we will lose the entire Headline News category, as well as the Stock Quotes, Sports News and Weather News. Reuters costs over $80,000 per month. This pushes the cost of content for NewCo to over $360,000 for relatively little benefit. Therefore, contrary to what we agreed earlier, I would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen. We will adjust screen size or insert graphics accordingly to get things looking right until our Phase 3 expansion. Please advise if you agree. 
Louise, I believe that if we want the Broker Client Contracts to be a source of $$ then we will need to wait and negotiate new contracts in several months after we reestablish a dominant position. If we want the Brokers to help us build liquidity immediately, we should give them the contracts for free - and pay them brokerage. Your thoughts? 
Louise, Sorry to bother you with this request, but I'm not sure who else to ask: A number of people have expressed an interest in the details of the auction process and any insight it might provide as to what a final deal might look like. Are there publically available documents covering the auctions process and descriptions of compliant bids? 
Louise, I don't think we have much value in assigning the broker client deals. Most contracts have automatically terminated or have been terminated by the brokers on account of not having access to the submission screens. There is very little outstanding money left in these contracts, anyway - most of them have monthly payments and those which do not are paid to only Q1 2002, anyway. Therefore, I think there is little value in pursuing assignment of these and I recommend we instead pursue new contracts (at the appropriate time), perhaps with the first few months free to soothe any bad feelings on their part. Do you agree? Dave Summary of position: 
Louise, Subject to final legal confirmation, it looks like I will need to terminate the Participation Agreement with BPUB by Dec. 31, or Enron could be obligated to proceed with building the HVDC tie. From what you know about the potential purchaser/s, Is there any point in my negotiating an extension of this date, or should I simply terminate? Please advise. Thanks, 
Louise, I want to make sure we are on exactly the same wavelength here: EnronOnline (i.e. the people on the list you gave me) now reports to you through me and therefore is no longer a part of Enron Networks. Right? 
Louise, I know this isn't ""due"" until the 7th, but we have been using a detailed activity list for a couple of weeks now, so here you go: The high level subject area summary is as follows: Activity	Date	EnronOnline person Responsible Prepare Top customer list for marketing	Complete	Teresa Mandola Prepare new website designs	4-Jan-02	Heather Alon Deletion of nonapplicable content (e.g. Market Info pages)	7-Jan-02	Kal Shah Prepare new broker client contracts	8-Jan-02	Daniel Diamond New ETA, PA, GTC from legal	8-Jan-02	Carl Carter Prepare marketing material designs to support new PA process	8-Jan-02	Kal Shah Preparation of cleaned data and products	9-Jan-02	Jennifer Denny Update of Registration Wizard	14-Jan-02	Kal Shah Approval of ETA, PA, GTC from new buyer	14-Jan-02	Dave Forster/Bob Shults Approval of website design from new buyer	14-Jan-02	Dave Forster/Kal Shah Obtain Approval for new Press Release	14-Jan-02	Dave Forster/Kal Shah Send out new PA's. Begin Registration Process	15-Jan-02	Teresa Mandola Send out NetCoOnline Press Release	15-Jan-02	Kal Shah Update of all online content for new company name	16-Jan-02	Rahil Jafry Test bridging from NetCoOnline to new back office systems	17-Jan-02	Torrey Moorer Approval of credit headroom calculation process from new buyer	17-Jan-02	Dave Forster/Bob Shults Official Launch of NetCoOnline	21-Jan-02	Dave Forster The more detailed activity list (if you want the detail) is as follows. Note that were there is no name, the name beside the subject category header prevails: 
Once we have a buyer, subject to their approval, I would like to offer Broker Client contracts to the existing Brokers, with the first x months free with no obligation to continue (but hopefully they will, and will pay us). I think this will help us to rebuild volumes. Please let me know if you disagree. 
Louise, I am trying to prepare a set of contract templates for NewcoOnline, which will give us a starting position to show to the new buyer. There is an alternative for the GTC's, which I would like to address in advance: a) Master Agreements which appear online and can therefore be accepted online for online or offline business. b) The existing GTC principle (derived from the long form confirms) I have spoken to several people in trading and opinions are evenly split. I prefer the simple GTC as it will help us to do more business sooner (full masters will take longer for companies to review, and they're going to want to negotiate the full master, anyway). What is your preference? 
Has anyone given any thought to the potential Enron NYSE delisting date relative to the date when the NETCo deal might be announced? I think there might be some ""spin"" implications. 
Did you have any further thoughts on the last version of the splash page I sent? 
Louise, - It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ? - On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers. 
Louise, Please let me know as soon as you have some resolution on the termination or continuation of content. The Reuters deal is month to month and is costing us $83,000 per month. I will be off tomorrow, but can be reached at home (281 992 2713). Thanks, 
Louise, The consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the Power guys would like to have a full blown Master Agreement on EnronOnline instead of a simpler GTC. Obviously, I can put either onto EnronOnline, but wanted to let you know before we do so. If you want us to stick with a simple GTC, please let me know. Thanks, 
Attached are the top customers for gas and the top customers for power. If  I have missed anyone who was in the meeting, please let me know. Thanks, Dave 
What level of expense do you want to be notified about? (e.g. I want to authorise Kal to spend about $5,000 over the next couple of weeks on preliminary work for marketing materials to support a relaunch of EnronOnline) 
Attached is a list of property which we identified in our meeting this morning which might be relevant to NewCo. Much of this overlaps what was probably discussed, but as I missed the first part of the meeting, I am including everything. Please call if you have any questions. Thanks, Dave 
Louise, I know you're swamped, so I am emailing this: I'm happy to proceed as soon as appropriate, as we discussed, on the assumption that you will be successful in preserving my bonus for this year. I'd like to rally the troops and get started on preparation for the next step, but before I can do much, we need to: - Make it official that I will be in charge. - Confirm or deny the following assumptions: - We will have a new name 
- Terri did the deal for $1.5 million gain to Enron. - Above profit was negotiated based on $4 million up-front payment. - For income smoothing reasons, OPPD asked to defer the payment, which we agreed to do. - OPPD also asked to retain the option for early payment in the event their circumstances changed. We agreed to do this, but also negotiated the LIBOR discount. i.e.: They gave us the potential time value for free, but have now exercised their option: Therefore we have only had the free time value for 5.5 months, instead of 11 (ish). 
I know you must be swamped. Let me know if I can help. 
Louise, Carlos has informed me that he has been told he will likely be laid off. You may wish to consider intervening to keep him: - If the new purchaser is interested in the TexMex concept, Carlos is the most important Mexican link. He has great relationships, has negotiated MOU's and is close to contract with multiple customers. - If we desire to retain EnronOnline expertise, Carlos has it. - He is still on the US payroll and has an Enron working visa. 
Has apparantly been contacted by an Enron-sponsored relocation team to move him back. His contract specifies Houston as his base and the company's obligation to return him. He has not instructed them to begin moving, nor has he been informed yet of whether or not he is still employed. 
Louise, I am on your calendar for 10:00. Attached is the risks document I plan to bring. Dave 
Dave, I am still diving into the depths of Tex-Mex, but cannot see a reason not to proceed with signing the ABB amendment as described in Salsa (4), as this amendment does not cost us anything up front and extends our build option to the end of the year. There are a number of risks associated with the Presidential Permit process, the possible imposition of an open season by FERC, relationship with CFE, BPUB infrastructure enhancements and service charge structure, etc. which we should discuss prior to waiving our Conditions Precedent under the DeAcero contract on July 31. Note that if we sign the ABB amendment and waive the Conditions Precedent along with DeAcero on July 31, we will want to immediately issue a Pre-Notice of the Notice to Proceed in order to ensure completion within the 502 day DeAcero commitment. 
The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agreements and individual commodity transactions is: ""UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd."", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel. I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue. 
Just a quick heads-up: UBS is intending to give everyone in Houston an email address in the format: firstname.lastname.ubswenergy.com. Obviously, this conflicts a bit in that we are promoting the online system as ubswenergy.com. I don't see this as a huge issue, but wanted you to know before it happens. 
You mentioned that you wanted to reword it. Have you had a chance to do so? I'm keen to get this communication out to the company by Monday morning. 
Attached is the customer priority list. This is intended to be the ""pre-approved"" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes US and Canadian entities in gas and power. I have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names. If individual legal names are needed, let me know - I can provide the list that way as well. Note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit. It appears a number of Canadian companies some non-online companies were not included in the original list. This most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them. I will be sending another list later, which will identify the type of Master Agreement priority for each (ISDA, Physical Gas, Physical Power) Dave 
Mark Taylor is apparantly talking to you tomorrow about this. I am intending to sent out PA's in the ""normal"" format tomorrow. If we have to jump through an additional hoop, we can do this once we have a signed PA (but I'm sure you will prevail!) 
Victory We have a definitive statement from UBS that we can brand our product as UBSWenergy  (OK, so the ""w"" still sucks, but I'm looking on the bright side). Setback We still have not started marketing to our Top 50, due to a) Not having phone numbers for Connecticut until about 4:00 today and (b) Not having an approved cover letter from legal (It turns out everyone thought someone else was doing it - despite repeated calls chasing this up). Plan As of minutes ago, I have a Lou Eber approved cover letter, which Lou specified requires approval from Mark Taylor and Claudia Robinson. I assume I will have these approvals by morning and will start marketing then. Dave 
There are several elements which have been relied upon in the past to verify the authority of the person signing a Password Application: 1) Direct knowledge of the individual signing. The energy community is relatively small. In most cases, we have personal knowledge of the person signing on behalf of the counterparty and have done business with them in the past. 2) Ostensible Authority. 3) 3rd Party Verification. For 3rd Party Verification, the following procedure is used after Credit, Legal and Contracts departments have approved the Counterparty for online transactions: ?	The Main reception number at the applicant company is called and a senior contact in the Trading Department is requested ?	A Vice President or Director of trading is requested for verification of the PA signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to Master Agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes. The company is informed that the phone call is being recorded. ?	Date, Name, Title and Phone Number of person who verifies the applicant is recorded in three places:  1) Access Tracking Database and 2) Online Trading Operations Control Form and 3) Recorded telephone conversation. 
Greg W. wants us to use new phone numbers for the Help Desk, etc. Unless I hear otherwise from you tomorrow, I will proceed with preparing our documents with the new Help Desk number. Dave P.S. I realise I have been emailing you a lot. Please let me know if you would like me to cut down - I'm never sure whether I'm overcommunicating or not. 
Following is the text of an email announcing the simulation, which I intend to send out first thing in the morning to all UBS Warburg Energy employees (i.e. Houston-based UBS employees), as per John Lavorato's request. If you have any comments, please email me by 8:00 am CST. Thanks, Dave We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, Dave Forster 713.853.1861 
Louise, I have received a copy of a priority list which you had forwarded to credit. This list is very similar to the Top 50 gas and Top 50 Power lists which we put together with Commercial - there are only a handful of companies different. Credit are asking for a prioritised list which has the specific legal names with whom we wish to trade. The Top 50 lists already have the specific legal name. We will add the specific legal name for the handful of companies which were on your list and not on ours, and forward to credit. 
I have met with John L and most trading heads and back office heads. Concensus was to have the simulation next Thursday morning (9-11). We are in the process of assembling documents for the simulation. You don't need to read them, but if you are interested, they will follow in the next email. 
Re: the HSR waiting period issue: We can proceed with our plans, but all correspondence will be handled through the UBS call center in Connecticut. I plan to start doing this tommorrow morning, assuming we get the Connecticut fax and phone numbers tonight. Detailed changes: - Fax number will be in Connecticut, and will roll to here. - Connecticut call center person will answer any Help Desk calls, which will then be transferred here. - Connecticut call center will send PA faxes in accordance with instructions from here. - Cover letter will have UBS letterhead, but will be unsigned and will specify Connecticut numbers - Splash page will be modified to show Connecticut numbers - Once we reach Closing Date, the numbers will be permanently forwarded to here. - All future correspondence (and the bulk mailings) will specify the Houston number The concern is that during the waiting period, we need for UBS people to represent UBS interests on all official correspondence with customers. Please call me if you have any concerns. I plan to put out the revised Splash page and start the Top 50 marketing efforts at about 10:00 am tomorrow morning. 
Louise, We tried to find a way around the $250,000 portalbuilder charge for content which I emailed you about before. Looks like there isn't a way - and in fact, the total charge will be closer to $1,000,000, including all of the components needed for content. So, the official question is: Do you want us to spend this much to preserve the ability to carry EnronOnline content, or do we revise the Quotes page to exclude content? I am personally having a hard time finding value for money in this expense - but you mentioned before that UBS were keen to preserve existing functionality. 
Louise, 1) I just received a call from Pat O'Donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the Top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from UBS corporate marketing folks, instructing us not to use the url: www.ubswenergy.com. It seems they want us to use www.ubswarburg.com/energy. Pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy.com tomorrow. He anticipates having resolution by noon. I personally don't care much what URL we use: the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important. Of course, a change in URL now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again. . . 2) UBS (in the form of Matt Meinel, who feels Mike Hutchins will be in agreement with him) do not want us to redirect traffic from www.enrononline.com to the new site, as they feel that promotes too much of an association with Enron. I disagree with their position, but don't think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name. Also, the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement. Please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed. We are ready to put the Splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow, but these 11th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and I feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name. 
I have spoken to or heard from Mark Taylor, Bill Bradford, Mark Haedicke, Leslie Hansen this morning. Here is the update: - Mark H. expects all documentation (templates only) to be complete and signed off this week. UBS legal is now apparantly also feeling the heat. - Bryan Murtaugh will be on site tomorrow night. They will work on getting Bryan's approval on final contract forms for all documents (physical, financial, GTC, Master, Adoption) through Thursday and Friday. - Bill will have credit clauses and headroom identified for Master and GTC for the Top 30 customers by end of this week, and for the entire list you gave him by beginning of next week. - My interpretation of this is that we will be in a position to start assembling custom Master Agreement early next week. I have stressed the importance of getting this finalised quickly, and pointed out that the commercial teams have been assigned to customers and are waiting only for legal documents. 
Kal came up with a couple of suggestions: 
Louise, - UBS do not want us to show ""UBSWenergy.com"" - they require ""www.ubswenergy.com"" (no caps) or ""ubswenergy.com"" (no ""www""). - This means that for the homepage to look right, we will change the name to ""UBS Warburg Energy"" beside the globe graphic. - Currently anticipate starting Top 50 marketing for PA's by tomorrow morning (UBS required changes on Splash page). - Some traders in the market have started to refer to us as UB SOL. Although the low-profile approach we discussed made sense, on further reflection, I think we need to aggressively promote a positive short name for the system, to avoid the ""SOL"" connotation. Even ""UBS Energy"" is a lot of syllables. We are working on finding some alternative (perhaps which don't use ""UBS"" in the name, as that seems to be a sensitive point). If we are to do this, we will need to lobby at a level higher than where I have been so far. If you agree with my concern, some higher level contact might be in order; perhaps with some of the people you have been meeting? - Will work with legal today on Master Agreements and GTC's, to try to get template approval AND to draft Masters for the Top 50, with specific credit terms. Dave 
Fyi: The PA and ETA have been with Jim Petrie of UBS legal for several days, but we still do not have UBS legal approval. I have been hassling Mark Taylor, who has in turn been hassling Jim. As a result, I am anticipating we cannot begin marketing to our Top 50 customers on Monday. The Splash page will be ready with full functionality Monday night, so I am hoping we get approval on Monday for a Tuesday Top 50 marketing launch. 
Louise, In the Governance email which you sent, Mike Bridges was identified as a member of the Operational Restart Sub-Committee. I assume you meant Mark Bridges. I suspect this might have lead to Mike receiving a phonecall today from UBS asking him for information. An excited Mike called me to ask if he is invited to join UBS. I told him that I thought it was a mistake, but that I would confirm it with you. 
Louise, Kevin Presto has some concerns about doing transactions with brokers and is thinking maybe on the power side that we will not do any broker transactions either over the telephone or online and he would like to talk about his ideas with you and the gas guys as well. I won't start marketing to brokers until I hear from you or we meet on the subject. Do you want me to organise a meeting? 
Louise, There seems to be some confusion over this, but I would like to proceed as follows. Please let me know if you disagree: 1) For all contracts, ""UBS AG, London branch"" will be used (online/offline, license applications, regulatory approvals, etc.) 2) For all marketing purposes, UBS Warburg Energy, LLC will be used (letterhead, brochures, etc.) 3) When using UBS Warburg Energy, LLC, we will include small print along the lines of:""UBS Warburg Energy LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG, London branch"" (I am confirming the wording and concept with legal). Thanks, 
All, Louise has asked me to coordinate across all departments on the Enron side for the integration with UBS and to be the point contact for the person who is leading the UBS side of the integration. Accordingly, please send me your launch timetable and top issues lists. Thanks, Dave 
Louise, Some further clarification on the HSR waiting period: - We will receive a letter indicating when the waiting period will expire. The actual expiry is anticipated to be midnight on Thursday, Feb. 7th. - It is possible that objections or problems could be raised during the waiting period. This we will not really know that we are cleared until sometime on Friday, Feb. 8th. Accordingly, I will plan on a tentative launch for Monday, February 11. I am still waiting for UBS legal approval of the PA and ETA. Once this is received, we will be ready to start our PA marketing efforts to the Top 50 customers. I intend to do this as soon as the documents are approved. If you need me to check with you before we start contacting customers, please let me know. Dave 
I spoke to Carol Essig today who confirmed to me that the Hart Scott Redina application is planned to be made later today. This means that the 15 day waiting period (confirmed to be calendar days, not business days) will expire on Friday, February 8. 
Louise, Although our actual content contracts are under conrol, it looks like we may need to spend $250,000 for infrastructure (Portalbuilder license). I will investigate further this afternoon to see if there are any alternatives. Do you want us to spend the money if the alternative is no content? Dave -------------------------- 
Would like to be considered for a promotion to Director as part of the move to UBS. I explained that a promotion for him was not planned at this time and he asked if I would raise the issue with you. 
Louise, I think I may have made an error in selecting Heather over Erica for UBS. It has become apparant that, though she has kept a lower profile, Erica has made a larger contribution to the system and has a broader skillset than Heather's. Accordingly, I would like to exchange these two for receiving an offer letter. If I am able to do this on the UBS side, do you object? Please advise as soon as you can. Thanks, 
Louise, 1) Has there been any resolution on whether we focus on marketing UBSenergy vs. UBSWenergy? 2) Is our launch date confirmed for Jan 29? (did you find out the actual date of filing for Hart-Scott?) 3) I am chasing the final, punctuation-correct name for the contracting party for GTC, ETA and PA purposes, but as yet do not have a definitive answer. 4) I am also chasing Articles of Incorporation so we can proceed with the Verisign application. 
Anne, I received your voice mail. We are working with each vendor to assign the contracts or enter into new contracts as required in order to ensure that content is available on relaunch of the system. Affected contracts are: Intelligence Press - no agreement required. Accuweather - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity Dow Jones - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity Reuters - working on new month-to-month contract with them. We will work with Leslie on getting written consents. Thanks, 
Louise, - UBS is planning to tell all of those who are offered positions to come to work at the Houstonion on Friday, not at the Enron building. At the Houstonian, they will have a series of presentations on the new company. I raised concerns about this last night: - Having the UBS offerees offsite means that everyone left in the building is effectively told they are not a first-round pick. - Those who remain in the building will have little to do but sit and feed off each other's discontent. - Some of the initial offerees may refuse, in which case we then have to go back to a discontent Estate person to offer them a position. This makes it very obvious to them and all their peers that they were a second-round draft choice. I have suggested that they either accelerate the contracting process so we know that we have everyone before Friday, or else delay the Friday meeting. The Friday meeting was stated as necessary so that everyone could understand their benefits before signing. This doesn't sound like a good reason to me. - I am told I will be approached today by someone from UBS HR. I assume this is what you warned me about and that my ""real"" contract/meeting will be with you. - UBS wants me to sign before they offer positions to others within EnronOnline. This doesn't make sense, but if true, can we meet as soon as possible? I'd like to make sure my people have their offers ASAP (for the above reasons), but I'd also like a little time to think about the offer you have in mind for me. - I remain concerned that the people who were previously offered retention bonuses will be in a position to walk away at the end of Feb. We are in a position where the critical people will be free to go, while the less critical people are incentivised to stay for 6 months. 
Louise, In the event that some of the people who are being offered positions in UBS do not take them, but instead resign, and we therefore keep someone in UBS who otherwise would have gone to the estate, I thought we should agree potential bonuses. To be clear: these bonuses would be paid ONLY if the individual wound up going to UBS instead of the Estate as currently planned. If you agree, please let me know and forward to Amy Fitzpatrick. This should allow us to respond quickly as events develop. Name			 Estate Contingent Bonus BOUDREAU, KARA L	 10,000 DELUCA, BRYAN A	 - DUNCAN, ERICA B	 12,000 GUILLORY, MICHAEL C	 2,500 HOANG, CHARLIE V	 4,000 O'DAY, KAREN 	 2,500 Zeman, Angie	 	12,000 
We are in the process of preparing Master Agreements to go to customers. Can these draft contracts be sent directly from here? Obviously, each pack is quite large - it would be nice to avoid having to ship them to Connecticut just to have them forwarded from there.

Here is the list with the final names, showing 8 people moving to Estate, 1 resignation and 30 left with NetcoOnline.

We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus. The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case: Week of Jan 14: Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"". A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users. The Splash page will look something like the following: 
We are now down to 38 (Ricky Oberai has left the testing group) I believe all of the offers have come from Duke. 
Louise, As you know, for our NetcoOnline relaunch, we will need the following from UBS ASAP: 1) PA and ETA approval 2) Agreement on new company name (""Netco"" replacement) and new online system name (""NetcoOnline"" replacement) 3) Approval of Press Release I assume all of these are underway. Please let me know if there is anyone at UBS whom you would like me to chase. Thanks, 
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"". We have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus. Our planned Re-Launch timetable is as follows: Week of Jan 14: Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with the new Buyer's name filled in.

Louise, I am intending to start getting brokers signed up as soon as we know our new company name and have the PA and ETA forms authorised. Do you think we need explicit buyer authorisation before we start signing up brokers? 
Louise, About 1 month ago, the process was initiated to disconnect the direct connections. Experience showed that we were spending money on something which provided little benefit to the customer. There is a chance that this process was not completed for every company (I am checking). I intend to ensure that the direct connections are all converted to regular internet connections. If you want the direct connections maintained, please let me know. 
We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST).

Couple More: 1) I heard a rumour that we will not be sending confirms when we relaunch. Is this correct? (I hope not) 2) Have you thought more about the PA's without Buyer name issue? 
1) Do you know if NetCo is going to have similar arrangements in Canada to what we had before bankruptcy? (e.g. trader in Houston trades Eastern Canada on behalf of ENA, but trader in Calgary trades Western Canada on behalf of ECC) 2) Looks like we might have to prepay 1 month to preserve Reuters content. I'm assuming this is no big deal, as we will still be month-to-month and can cancel. 
Is a holiday. (Martin Luther King Day) Accordingly, I will plan on Jan 22 as our tentative launch date. 
I imagine you may have already taken care of this, but just in case, here is the original email I sent you, with the ETA and PA from last night pasted in: Louise, As discussed, there are a few items for which we will need the approval of the new Buyer as soon as possible, in order to ensure we are able to proceed with a relaunch of EnronOnline (NETCoOnline) without delay. Two of the items for which we need approval as soon as possible are the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA), which work together to provide electronic trading access to the products available on NetcoOnline. Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years. Contracts Structure There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online. PassWord Application (PA) The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs. The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check. Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place. General Terms and Conditions (GTC) When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply. Password Application: Electronic Trading Agreement: 
Louise, Three questions/issues which I'd appreciate your feedback on: 1) I am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators/traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the top 50 customers (sending draft PA's) and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customers. 2) After some more thought, I'm on the fence about sending out the PA's without names. The following occurs to me: - Sending them out on Tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will be - Sending them out with the final name probably helps our credibility - The PA/ETA is a very simple form; customers probably don't require the extra three days to review them. - Following the public release of our new Buyers' identity with the first release of the PA helps build a bit more excitement than otherwise. 3) I understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers' name to another company. I don't think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later. Can we keep this in? Thanks, Dave 
This is the list which was sent out on Saturday, updated to show full legal name in all cases along with the old Enron CPID. Since Saturday, I have also removed a couple of the names which did relatively little business and could be processed as 2nd priority customers. Dave 
As per my email from yesterday; Attached are Pipeline companies, Transmission Company (Ercot) and Canadian companies not on the prior ""Louise Approved"" list which credit has been working on. We have been having difficulty tracking down the full legal name for some of the storage and transmission companies, and for AEC storage, there are two names - I assume only one may be required. For any cases where the full legal name cannot be found today, we have included the group name. We will resolve the remaining full legal names on Monday morning, when other staff are available. Dave 
Pat, Attached is a summary of key issues affecting commercial and operations groups from the UBS Warburg Energy side for your discussion with Mike Hutchins. I am copying Louise and each of the people who provided input in preparing this list. Note that there are many items being worked on which do not appear on the list - these are only the most pressing. Dave 
Louise, Here is a sneak preview for you of a list which Pat O'donnell asked me to pull together for him, for his briefing to Mike Hutchins this evening. It is not yet complete, but I wanted to give you a heads-up before I send to Pat. Dave 
You might already know this, but: MSNBC just played a video tape of the last all-employee meeting and included the ""Are you on drugs"" question of Ken Lay. 
We just received an invitation to speak at Ceraweek. You mentioned that you thought participation was not necessary - does the speaking invitation change your opinion? 
Latest version of the critical issues list. 
Louise, Since our conversation today, I have discovered that by terminating the Reuters contract, we will lose the entire Headline News category, as well as the Stock Quotes, Sports News and Weather News. Reuters costs over $80,000 per month. This pushes the cost of content for NewCo to over $360,000 for relatively little benefit. Therefore, contrary to what we agreed earlier, I would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen. We will adjust screen size or insert graphics accordingly to get things looking right until our Phase 3 expansion. Please advise if you agree. 
OK - here's the sort of thing I am thinking of (still needs Kal's magic). I suspect you were thinking of a pop-up notice. Given that we aren't really showing anything on EnronOnline at the moment, I suggest we take down EnronOnline entirely and replace it with a splash page which says something like the following: COMING SOON Enron is working with potential industry partners to assemble a new venture which will combine Enron's trading and market - making expertise with the financial strength and reliability of an A rated entity. Upon formation of this new company, we anticipate that we will be able to announce the launch of a new trading platform for North American gas and power, providing services similar to those previously available on EnronOnline. Please check back with this site for future updates on plans for the new trading platform. 
Louise, - It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ? - On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.

We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus. The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case: Week of Jan 14: Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"". A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users. The Splash page will look something like the following:

There will be two changes to the EnronOnline Website, effective for Monday morning: 1) There will be a new release for internal users only, which should fix the freeze-up of floating windows which some users have reported. 2) The old version of EnronOnline (the vesion without the news and weather content) will no longer be available. The old version will be retired to make way for new functionality such as the Spreads product, which will allow customers to simultaneously transact in both of the underlying legs of a spread simultaneously. Some customers are still transacting through the old version of the EnronOnline website. We are making every effort to contact all such customers directly, but it is possible they may call you, complaining that their website doesn't work. If this happens, please do the following: 1) Explain that the new version of the website is just as fast as the old version, but has additional functionality, like floating windows, news and weather. 2) Explain that there are solutions for any technical difficulties they might have in upgrading 3) Transfer them to Product Control for additional assistance.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, Dave Forster 713.853.1861

On Friday night, we plan to make some changes to Stack Manager, which should be effective by Saturday morning. These changes are: 1) Order Sweep functionality 2) Removal of Enron references and logos The Order Sweep allows you to fill the order you right-click on, plus all of the orders above it. Until this release, fill order functionality has been available only for the order at the top of your stack. Note that it will still not be possible to fill any individual order below the top of the order stack unless you also fill the orders above it (i.e. no ""picking off"" orders). Be careful. Right - clicking on an order stack will fill not only the order at the top of the stack, but all orders from the top down to and including the one you click on (This is an ""order sweep""). If we experience any difficulties with this release on Friday night, the release may be ""rolled back"" to the old version. You will be able to tell if this release has been rolled back by the logo which appears on the Stack Manager. 
We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned. UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts: For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

Kevin, I was talking with Louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online, but rather that we should proceed with streamlined GTC's in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts. This does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long-form Master Agreement. EnronOnline is set up so that a negotiated Master Agreement will supercede the GTC. 
All, Louise has asked me to coordinate across all departments on the Enron side for the integration with UBS and to be the point contact for the person who is leading the UBS side of the integration. Accordingly, please send me your launch timetable and top issues lists. Thanks, Dave

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties.

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

Elizabeth, I assume that there must be some publically available documents which describe the auction process and the structure of compliant bids. I would like to obtain a copy of such documents, as they may provide some insight into what the deal structure might look like and help us to prepare NETCoOnline for as quick a relaunch as possible. Do you know where I might obtain copies of such documents?

Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, Dave Forster 713.853.1861 
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus. The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case: Week of Jan 14: Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"". A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users. The Splash page will look something like the following: 
1) Only online transactions will be commission-free. 2) The message bar at the top of the screen shows the ultimate customer, but not the broker. Today's Transactions at the bottom of your Stack Manager screen shows both.

There will be a Transmission Presentation with Dave Forster & Stephen Benchluch on November 28, 2001 from 3:30-5:30.  If you have any questions or I can be of further assistance please let me know. Thanks, 
If I can't scare up a room, maybe we can just grab a table downstairs . . .? 
We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). Regards, Dave Forster 713.853.1861 
What did you decide with Mike Bridges? If he's not a good fit for you, I might be able to use him here. 
Fletch, Can you buy/sell gas on EnronOnline? We're working up a concept for a possible play for Monday. Would like to bounce it off you when you have a moment. 
With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned. UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts: For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861). Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas 
Please add to my calendar. Thanks, Fletch -----Original Appointment----- 
David, Can you forward a copy to me of your current GTC? I note that the language is similar to other EnronOnline Products, which is good for consistency. However, I note that there has been a subsitution of Calculation Period where other products use Determination Period. However, I gather that for power, Calculation Period is 1/2 hour, whereas for other Products, Determination Period is generally one month. I hope this does not cause problems if the GTC language has been borrowed from other Products. Would the following amendments clarify the MW/Mwh/Calculation Period relationship? Current:  The Counterparty will submit a volume in megawatts (MW) via EnronOnline. This number will be divided in half to convert it into MWh. This number will be used to calculate the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period. Suggestion: The Counterparty will submit a volume in megawatts (MW) via EnronOnline. This number will be divided in half to convert it into total MWh delivered in each 1/2 hour Calculation Period, which shall be the Notional Quantity. Current: The Index shall be the spot price at the Victoria . . . Suggestion: The Index shall be the spot price published for each 1/2 hour at the Victoria . . . Thanks, Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/02/2000 06:41 AM 
Mark I would like to thank you for your review of our draft product description. The benefit of your experience is invaluable in assisting us to develop our forms. I had a couple of reservations about some changes you proposed. In particular the changes  to the Swap product description  would involve the Fixed and Floating Price in  each Calculation Period (half hour) being averaged over a Settlement or Determination Period. The payment obligation would  then be multiplied by the Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period to get the amount payable on the Settlement Date.   This not the way electricity derivatives are traded on the Australian electricity pool.   In addition to being inconsistent with the terminology both within our documentation and industry agreed forms we would have difficulty in having this new trading form adopted by the market. In brief, in Australia electricity trades occur  in the following manner: - Trades are calculated on the basis of  discrete half hourly Calculation Periods. - Payment obligations for these Calculation Periods are then aggregated  on Settlement Date each month. The Settlement Date is defined as the day each month when parties are obliged to make payments under the National Electricity Code. - It is the market custom for the Notional Quantity to be quoted in MWs. This number is then divided in half to calculate to convert it  into MWhs, which becomes the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period.  (To ensure its consistency with market practice we have determined that amounts should be quoted in MWs then converted in this manner into MWhs. This is explained in the product description Mark Taylor and myself discussed the principles that should be followed in preparing long form product descriptions.  Whilst we should endeavour for consistency in drafting and in terminology amongst products, the primary concern is to ensure that the terms used in the long form descriptions are consistent with our GTCs,  other relevant contractual arrangements with the counterparties and market trading forms.  There are also  practical reasons for adopting terminology used in a particular market.  We would have some difficulty in attempting to market EnronOnline to potential counterparties if we also simultaneously convince them to commence trading on another type of product.  Furthermore, departure from agreed forms of trading will increase the transaction risk. I would be interested in getting your views as we are planning to turn out a number of descriptions over the next week based on our original form. 
David, I have changed the description of the reference load shape for OffPeak and Flat trades. Can you pls OK these before I proceed with other regions. In the meantime, I will use the original Peak template as the base for options. Rgds Paul David Minns 31/01/2000 15:05 
The major change is the adoption of a new product into Australia. The current arrangement is for trades to be effected in discrete 30 minute Calculation Periods settled monthly in accordance with an the NEMMCO calendar. What is proposed is for the floating amounts to to be averaged over a Settlement Period. The implication is that the ""Average Floating Amount"" is this the Average Floating Price multiplied by the number of Calculation Periods. This should equate to the same figure. There are a couple of concerns This  is not what is currently traded. There are no definitions to cover these terms. We would also have to amend the GTCs and existing ISDA Agreements to be able to trade this type of Product. Apart from additional definitions issues such as rounding conventions for averaging would also need to be addressed. We will need to educate potential counterparties as to this produce. There is also a change to require counterparties to quote a volume per Settlement Period. A figure is quoted in MW and then multiplied by the number of hours within the Settlement Period to get the ""Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period"". Assuming this is limited to the number of hours within each  ""Victorian NEM Peak"" during the Settlement Period it should work. But there will need to be an explanation that the Average Floating Amount is the Average Floating Price multiplied by the  Notional Quantity Per Settlement Period. If we must adopt this form then we have no choice but I believe that it will cause difficulties in implementing EnronOnline. We will need not only sell the system but also new products. A further level of complexity will be added to trades as we attempt modify the current Australian market conventions. Paul Smith 01/26/2000 07:45 AM 
David, Here is the response from Mark. Comments? Rgds Paul 
David I have reviewed the language sent by Paul. The description is broken down into 8 paragraphs - for the record: Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7 all cover details usually covered in the Product Type description (7 is actually settlement date[s] for which we do not have a separate attribute). Paragraph 4 is reference period. Paragraph 5 is Index. Paragraph 6 is loadshape. These look fine to me - subject to my observations on whether we can use the 'Averaging' language. Paragraph 8 covers 2 attributes - currency (looks fine) and Unit of Measure - for which I suggest we go with our current language for MWh - which details that the volume submitted by the counterparty is MWh per hour. The product type language does not refer to determination (or settlement) periods, but calculation periods (half hourly) - and then details the computation of volume for a calculation period. If we are consistent with the approach used in other products we would refere to the average reference price (being the index) within a determination period and further define the determination period. (If we average this also changes the loadshape language). I have attached a document with the language I would propose referring to averaging. Paul I have reviewed the descriptions comparative to those already held for power financial swaps on the system. David may have further comments. David is not back until 7th Feb. and you may wish to have your legal team consider if the 'averaging language' can be used in Australia before he returns. If it can not I suggest we could add the definition of determination period, and state that the settlement amount is the aggregation of the amounts computed for all calculation periods within the determination period. The second attachment purely takes the language from your document and orders it as it would appear assuming all the attribute descriptions are as per my breakdown above. regards M Paul Smith@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 24/01/2000 07:00 
Apologies. Please use this attachment as the prior attachment is incorrect. Rgds Paul 
Attached is the new site map file for auctions. It has been modified to reflect the ordering of the global nav and the removal of the ATA, which is no longer needed. The View/Accept Contract screen will contain text cut which is currently in the About Storage Services section (I will modify the text file accordingly when received from Haakon). Note that we are planning on using the same template as represented by the Market Info. screen in EnronOnline, although there will be a unique set of graphics for each of: 1) The Auctions Home Page 2) All of the EnBank pages (which will share the same graphic treatment, with appropriate title amendments). 
Jay: Here is the latest site documentation and the site map. Please call me at any time if you have questions (cell: 713 562 8678) Awais/Rahil/Paul: If you have any comments on the text, please let me know. Note that this text has been approved by legal (mostly) and we are short on time, so text changes will only be made for pressing reasons. Justin/Mark/Haakon/Jonathan: Changes from last version appear redlined. Thanks, Dave 
Mark, Have you had a chance to review these and are you happy that they are OK for uploading? Is there anything which still needs to be done for you to be happy to sign off for the Australian launch? I noted in an update from a few weeks ago that David Minns still had a couple of concerns from a regulatory perspective. Not sure if he has resolved these issues yet or not . . . 
No rest for the wicked, huh? I'd offer to take you out for that drink tonight, but I need to pick up Avril from the airport in an hour. Hope you got to enjoy at least some of your weekend. . . Dave 
I have not received any comments.  I consider it final.  Let me know if you need to have it customized for any particular circumstance.  Since I don't know who (or for that matter what) the PCG heads are, I sugggest that if they need it you send them copies. David Forster 02/13/2000 04:23 PM 
Mark, Please let me know when you consider this letter finalised - one of us should send copies to the PCG heads. Dave 
Mark, I have suggested a few changes on the attached, redlined version. Please let me know if you think these are appropriate. Thanks, Dave 
Justin, I am assuming that there is no reason from a legal perspective to restrict access to EnronOnline EnBank Auctions - so we will proceed with setting up the user profiles this way (I've already checked with credit). Please let me know if this is assumption is incorrect and we need to restrict access. Thanks, 
Credit are pushing to launch online credit trading for this coming Monday. Have you both ""signed off"" on the process, or are there issues outstanding which need to be resolved, from your point of view? 
Mark, Further to our conversation the other day, are you happy for us to change the following in the GTC screen in EnronOnline: Old:  ""(Guest Users will view Generic GTCs which are shown for information 
Mark, I don't get all warm and fuzzy about point #1 - what do you think? Dave 
Dear All, Attached is a draft proposed comfort letter dealing with the issues that Yorkshire Electricity has with respect to the ETA.  I have forwarded this to their lawyers' for comments. Please note that the letter does not amend the ETA, and is in no way inconsistent with the current legal structure of EOL. I have told Yorkshire's lawyer that this document is subject to internal commercial sign-off, so if you do have any comments please feel free to forward them to me. Thanks, Edmund. 
Yes - Thanks. Dave 
All, We are intending to launch the EnronOnline Auctions site tonight (Houston time). The site is in near-final form and can be seen at testweb1.eoltest.com. You will need a User ID for the test database to see this site. A comprehensive last look by all would be appreciated - please login to the site and let me know if you have any issues. Obviously, due to the extremely tight timeframe, I will need feedback today. Text should be as approved by each of you (bits and pieces each), although I did make some amendments to some of the instructional text early this morning. Thanks, 
Amita: Could you please have someone provide a transaction User ID in Test to Justin and Edmund ASAP? Tara: The same for Mark Taylor All ID's should be for the TEST database. Thanks, 
All, I am aware that early in the EnronOnline process, some GTC's were only generated for the ""With Collateral"" category and hence, all companies transacting in that commodity were subject to the collateral clause. I am now starting to wonder if this was an oversight, or if there is a reason why all counterparties should be bound by a collateral clause for the following GTC's/Products: I would appreciate any insight which any of you can offer. Thanks, 
Bryan, I have just received a copy of a press release draft for credit derivatives which indicates a launch date of February 23rd. As discussed at our previous meeting, we require 2 weeks from receipt of all necessary international due diligence and approvals to complete the update of the user profiles which will be affected by credit derivatives. As we have not yet received these approvals, the date of February 23rd is not possible to achieve for inclusion of credit derivatives on EnronOnline. Also, as previously discussed, EnronOnline is a registered trademark and we need to approve any references which go to customers. I presume that the website includes such references, but I have not yet seen it. Can you forward the internal address and/or confirm that the website is now in its final form? It is critical that all international due diligence be completed prior to any new product being introduced on EnronOnline. Mistakes are far too visible - we need to see documentation to show that everything is in place before any new products are added and before we start making changes which affect our customers. As agreed, we will ensure that EnronOnline is ready for credit derivatives within two weeks of receiving all the necessary information and approvals. Please forward this information as soon as possible. Thanks, Dave 
All, I have looked over the U.S. credit GTC and the long descriptions. I see we have decided to go with quarterly billing, rather than monthly. Will the payment/collections cycle cause any heartburn for the back office? I didn't spot any problems with the long descriptions. A few relatively minor comments on the GTC's - which you may or may not want to consider: - Clause 2.(e) (i) (1) - Does this clause preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions? Could we append: ""with regard to the Transaction""? - What happens if a Rep or Warranty is broken? Does that constitute sufficient breach to terminate the contract? I'm thinking specifically about sleeving, which is perhaps covered by Clause 2(e)(ii)(1)? I still think that sleeving is one of the most significant commercial risks faced by online trading of derivatives. If I were working for a third party, I'd immediately look for ways to set up a sleeving service to sell credit protection to the Reference Entities where the Reference Entity or its affiliate views its own risk differently from Enron. If I were the Reference Entity in question, I'd consider: a) Buying a load of protection via sleeving and then declaring bankruptcy - then do a Phoenix (in the UK at least) b) Buy a load of protection via sleeving, then take the Credit Derivatives to another third party financial institution and using the credit derivatives as collateral to increase my line of credit - I'm no expert, but I suspect there might be an interesting leverage effect here, which might actually cause a significant increase in Enron's risk exposure. c) Like (b), only the financial institution could buy the credit derivative with or without the need for sleeving - we probably need a restriction on this? (I know financial institutions are not our preferred counterparts up front, but if I were a financial insitution, I'd quickly find a way around this limitation - Affiliates or Sleevers. -  Do you think it would beneficial to strengthen our protection against sleeving by adding something to Clause 2, like: ""It is not entering into a Transaction for the purpose of concluding a similar transaction with the party (or any Affiliate of such party) which is the Reference Entity in the Transaction"". - Should Def'n of ""Contract Currency"" be ""Contractual Currency""? (""Contractual"" is also used in the Long Descriptions) - Def'n of ""Credit Product"" - after ""Entity"", should we insert ""which is""? - Are we being a bit too nasty by defining the Determination Agent as ""Enron""? As the reference to Determination Agent in the contract is in a context similar to that of an arbitrator, it seems a bit cheeky to then define ourselves as the arbitrator - would this be enforceable if we were in court? I'm assuming the other GTC's are very similar to the U.S. one and I have not read them. Dave 
EnronOnline Auctions are now live in the Production database, with EnBank virtual storage as the first product offering. There is a new Auctions button on the bottom of the Quotes screen (replaces the old Market Info. button). Please look over the site contents and let me know if you spot anything which needs to be edited. For detailed EnBank questions, please refer customers to the EnBank HelpDesk at 011 44 (0) 207 783 7700. All media calls concerning EnBank should be directed to Jonathan Whitehead: 011 44 (0) 207 783 6534. Media calls concerning EnronOnline Auctions within Enron's broader EnronOnline/e-commerce strategy will be handled by myself: 001 713 853 1861. Many thanks to those who have put in long hours to bring EnBank and the new auctions site to fruition in record time. 
Mark, I would appreciate your comments on the following FAQ's, intended to be a guide for Louise/myself/PR in the event we take a media call regarding the injunction/lawsuit. Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please let me know. Any calls received from the media will be answered by Louise, or in Louise' absence, by myself, with PR in the room (Louise will be back in the office on Monday and I suspect it is very unlikely that we would receive any calls before then). Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline? A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff. Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop? A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements which Agency was involved in developing. Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop? A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements which Enron developed. Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency? A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without authorisation from Enron. Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit? A We are not releasing that information at this time. Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged the competitive lead of EnronOnline? A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined. Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies? A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very capable IT consultancy companies. Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided? A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual contributors. Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other companies looking to build something like EnronOnline? A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com. Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information into a public forum. A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our contractor does not seem to have been upheld. Q11 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction? A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information. Q12  If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you also filing a lawsuit? A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate. 
Just wanted to let you know that Australia is aiming for a March 20 launch. 1) Mark T/Debbie: Can you both confirm that you have reviewed and approved the Australian customer list? (Debbie - I think you may have reviewed the list, but I'm not sure if Mark has seen a copy yet) 2) Mark T: Final long descriptions should be available very shortly (next day or two?) Can you update me on what you have/have not seen and if you are happy with what has been covered so far? I believe you have been in contact with David Minns, so I am hopnig everything is in order. 3) Frank: Please coordinate with Debbie to ensure that we have input from all required depts. with regard to the customer list. Thanks, 
It is obviously a very high priority to ensure that BEA do not make the Agency presentation covering EnronOnline available on their website. Kevin/Jay: Can you please try to identify the appropriate BEA contact as a matter of priority this morning? Richard/Mark: Please advise as to how strong we can be in warning BEA not to publish the information on their website. Thanks, Dave 
We are planning on having credit trading ready for EnronOnline launch on March 8. I believe the legal due diligence and credit due diligence is now complete. The initial list of 50 customers have been approved for credit trading. Of the 20 reference entities, only the following have been approved: Reference Entity    Approval Status Birka Energi AB     Approved Graningeverkens A/B    Approved London Electricity    Approved Scottish and Southern Energy plc  Approved Seeboard plc     Approved Sydkraft AB     Approved Cinergy Corp     Approved The following have not been approved: BC Group plc Hyder plc National Power plc PowerGen UK Scottish Power UK plc Duke Energy Corp Dynegy Inc. El Paso Energy Corp Pacific Gas & Electric Company The Southern Company Inc Lucent Technologies Nortel Networks Corp Reliant Energy Inc Dave Paul Simons 02/24/2000 06:14 PM 
In Bryan's absence, please work together where necessary to let Mark Taylor, Ed and me know/have the following as soon as possible so we can finalise our legal due diligence before launch of online credit trading: best estimate of the launch date for credit trading the final list of counterparties the final list of reference credits Thanks Paul 
Mark, 
David, Thanks for your email. I noted a few points which I hope may be helpful: - re: your comment: ""Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties"" - Please note that we are able to carry up to two versions of the GTC Online - One with the collateral clause and one without - and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept. based on creditworthiness of the customer. Of course, this does not impact our ability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend the terms of the GTC for specific customers - we just can't carry copies of this amendment electronically on EnronOnline. - Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name? - I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities and internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in Australia. - Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the ""Exempt Futures Market Declaration""? Does this apply to ourselves as well as our customers? Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers and/or any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power (if any)? - Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states ""EnronOnline prices are firm"". I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law regarding the legal definition of ""Invitation to Treat"", ""Offer"" and ""Acceptance""? Please note also the related information on the ""Click for Details"" link on the homepage. - The comments in the Mallesons document regarding 3. ""Enron Responds to the Offer"" are not strictly correct. The customer is essentially only able to select a volume equal to or less than that shown on EnronOnline and can only submit a price which is shown on EnronOnline (please call me for a more detailed discussion of the price range function if needed). Enron can only reject such Offers if the customers' credit limit is insufficient, or if the price or volume is no longer on the system at the instant in which the customers' offer hits our database. The acceptance/rejection of a customer's offer at our database is entirely automatic and nearly instantaneous. - 5. ""Confirmation Exchanged"" - although we currently issue faxed confirmations, please note that under EnronOnline, we are not under obligation to do so - the electronic confirmation is deemed sufficient. - Does the first PA amendment read correctly? (also the first ETA amendment) - GTC amendment: Do we need to reference ""ISDA""? Is it not possible at some time now or in the future, to have a non-ISDA master? Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/25/2000 08:26 AM 
Attached is a draft advice from Mallesons on EnronOnline. Of immediate concern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next week. Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments. These are in the annexes to the advice. Following are my comments Password Agreement  - Fine, seems a good to give address for notices etc. ETA - I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under Australian law. The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US. The suggested amendment to clause 3(c) I believe we could dispense with. It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server. However, from what I have been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality. GTCs - Minor changes. The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to the  collateral clause. Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties As a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the ETA for inclusion in Road Show. I expect to settle the advice early week  and will circulate it. 
Mark, Paul would like to start his roadshow with Australian customers next Tuesday (Monday afternoon, our time). Could you please review the amendments which David Minns has recommended for the PA and  ETA today, so that Paul can take a copy of at least the PA with him when he visits the customers? Thanks, 
Mark, With the addition of the ATA and EnronOnline auctions, we will need to provide the customers a way to identify to us that they wish only to transact on the Auctions. I am thinking the easiest way to do this is with a check box on the PA which says ""(Optional): This application is for EnronOnline 
Mark Taylor has confirmed that the approval processes are separate for legal. Dave 
It is my understanding that the EnronOnline approval process is separate and approval for EnronCredit.com does not automatically mean approval for EnronOnline. Debbie/Mark: Can you confirm or refute my understanding? Thanks, Dave Bryan Seyfried 02/28/2000 12:26 PM 
Attached is the current list of reference credits which are posted on EnronCredit.com.  It is our understanding that we can quote any of these via EnronOnline subject to approval from the EOL team.  Pls. confirm this understanding to all of us but especially mssrs. dilworth and forster 
Mark, We have customers who are now filling out the new form of the Australian PA. As a result, we will need an Online Australian ETA very shortly. Can you please approve/disapprove of the ETA form forwarded by David Minns? (copy attached). Once we have your approval, we will put it on the system. Thanks, 
The PA: 
Mark/Justin, Attached is a copy of the Australian PA. It includes the addition of an Address for Service. Do you think we should incorporate this in our other PA's as well? I realise that in many instances we are already doing business with the relevant company - and the same or similar information might be included on the Registration form (where completed) - but are you concerned about ambiguity in the event that no Registration form is completed? Also: We will need to have some way to distinguish PA's which arrive for customers who want access to Auctions only. What do you think about adding a statement like: ""(Optional): Tick this box if you wish to have access only to EnronOnline auctions and not to the main transactions site""  [tick box]. If you wish to proceed with either of the above, we will need to revise all PA's and post them on the website. Thanks, Dave 
Mark, The ETA does contain some redlines (Tools/Highlight Changes). Not sure if these reflect changes from NA or not - perhaps David Minns can shed some light? Dave Mark Taylor 03/02/2000 01:07 AM

Can youn craft a generic document to handle both cases? Dave Mark Taylor 03/02/2000 01:09 AM 
I had assumed we were going to have a separate PA for the Auction-only counterparties.  The PA contains an unfortunate reference to the ETA which will need to change if they will only be accepting the Auction-only agreement. David Forster 02/29/2000 10:00 AM

Mark, We were trying to keep the PA to a single page due to concerns about the amount of legalise which would need to be read - we didn't want the form to be a deterrant. In this case, the addition is just some blank lines to insert address for service (plus a few words in the body of the PA) - so I'm not as concerned about the impact on length. If we do not know the company, then a completed Registration Form is required - if we do know the company, then the Registration Form is not required. It could be argued that if we know the company, then we should already know the address for service - but I assume this might lead to errors if the address for service desired by the customer for  EnronOnline GTC's is any different from what we have on file? - I assume this was the reason David Minns forwarded this change. I'm happy (and perhaps prefer) to have the address for service included only on Australian PA's, if neither of you see a need elsewhere - although if you don't think its necessary elsewhere, then perhaps it is also not necessary in Australia, in which case we could simplify the form? Please note Australia is already distributing forms with their marketing packs, so if we are going to change the form, sooner is better. Comments appreciated . . . Dave Mark Taylor 03/02/2000 01:13 AM 
May I also point out that we went to great pains to keep the PA to a single page.  This one looks like it runs over to the second page - at least as laid out here.  I was also under the impression that a completed registration form was required before a user ID and password could be issued.  While I don't object to having an address for notices on the PA, I don't think it is necessary in North America if we have a completed registration form. David Forster 02/29/2000 10:01 AM

As mentioned in email to Mark. Please pass along any  concerns you may have on this to me before I respond to Justin and Edmund (hopefully later today). Thanks, Dave 
Hi Dave, Hope all is well! I've attached a comfort letter that we propose to send to Eastern.  Please feel free to make any comments you see fit.  If you have any queries on it please feel free to contact Justin or myself. Thanks, Edmund. 
Mark? 
Dave: I've read the comfort letter.  With respect to item #1, the first paragraph is fine.  With respect to the second paragraph, what situation is he trying to address?  For example, I thought that in situations where the counterparty clicked on a price and the price changed in the counterparty's favor before the trade was executed, that the counterparty would get the better price. The second paragraph might negate this as written.  Can a situation really arise where the system misreads a counterparty's offer?  I think that we need to be very careful in what we say here. With respect to point #2, I need to defer to Mark Taylor on this because I thought that the confirmations control, but it could be the case that our electronic records could prevail if there is a conflict between the 2.  That would seem to make sense to me but I would prefer that Mark concurred with this. Carol 
Bryan, I believe Mark Taylor is out of the office until Wednesday. At this point, I believe there are 6 approved Reference Entities for EnronOnline. We will add more up to the previously discussed 20 as approvals are received. Dave Bryan Seyfried 03/05/2000 04:43 PM 
After reviewing all of the lists, attached is the list of reference credits that I forwarded to Mark to load on Enorn Online. Call me if you have any concerns. 
It has come to my attention that there may be a difference between London and Houston in the legal approval process for Reference Entities. I am told that approval of Reference Entities in Europe for EnronCredit.com means approval for EnronOnline also. However, in the U.S., I am of the understanding that a different approval process is applied. Justin/Edmund/Mark:  Could you please coordinate and tell me: 1) Is my understanding correct? 2) Are we all happy to proceed with this understanding, or does something need to change? 
At this point, the following applies: 1) European Customer Profile Due Diligence on existing EnronOnline customers (for determining whether or not the customers may ultimately be granted Execute status or not) has been completed or the UK and Finland, but is outstanding for Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland. 2) North American Customer Profile Due Diligence on existing EnronOnline customers is complete. Canadian customers cannot have any access and there are no insurmountable reasons why a U.S. customer might not have Execute Access. 3) There are 5 approved Reference Entities - Expected to be 25 by tonight or tomorrow. 4) There are 50 Company Profiles with Execute Status. 5) Everything is in place technically to have the Reference Entities and Customer Profiles running for Wednesday morning. If anyone is under an understanding different to the above, please call me. Thanks, 
Bob/Sheri, Attached is the PA which should be sent to customers with the Auction packs. Note it is different from the U.S. PA which is currently on the system. Dale: Please upload this new PA in place of the NA PA on Friday. Thanks, 
Please note in 1: It is not present in the English ETA. Mario: Please check the U.S. ETA to see if there is an arbitration clause there. Thanks, Dave 
Revising the Electronic Auction Transactions Agreement we noticed there is an arbitration clause (6e). 2 issues about that clause were raised: 1. It is not present in the English ATA. Should it be mentioned in both, neither or maintained the way they are? 2. Are there arbitrators with 8 years professional experience in the Internet Auctions Market? Thanks, Mario

Mark, Looks like we will be adding Japan to the list of countries in which Customers will be able to transact. Could you please set the ball rolling on the drafting of a new PA and ETA? Also: We have a new addition to our group: Mario Parra-Cardoso. Mario will be working with me in getting Japan up and running - so you may receive some phone calls from him on the subject. Thanks, 
Attached is the latest version of the website text, with comments from Harry Collins: 
I inserted the missing table: 
Further to recent correspondence on this subject: ""Killing"" EnronOnline deals has always been against policy, for a number of reasons, including the need to demonstrate to customers that this is a binding way to do deals and also to provide an auditable process to auditors who may be sceptical of an online transaction system - i.e. we need to show that clicking on the screen  results in a deal which results in an invoice every time. In the same way that it is rare to conclude a transaction by telephone with a trader and then attempt to ""back out"", we must ensure it is a rare event on EnronOnline. Deals can only be terminated under special circumstances, which must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the legal department in consultation with Credit and EnronOnline commercial staff and covered with a special contract entered into with the Counterparty. In all other circumstances, ""undoing"" a deal is at the discretion of the trader and is most easily accomplished by an OTC transaction which reverses the volume, price and payment impact, thus addressing most of the concerns raised below. Dave Brent A Price 03/08/2000 09:02 AM 
I find it difficult to believe we would even be considering the use of OTC trades to effectively ""kill"" another deal.  The points Kathryn raise below are good ones.  How often do deals need to be terminated?  Unless that number is substantial (and I would hope it is not), why the opposition to executing a termination agreement with the counterparty and resolving the problem in the cleanest manner? 
Sheri: Last week you provided me with the options for a process that you and Louise were working on for killed deals.  The 2 options for killed deals were 1. the counterparty would call and execute an OTC to back out the deal (the opposite of whatever he transacted on line) and  2. Enron would execute to the counterparty a termination agreement per deal the counterparty wanted to back out.  My concerns for the first option are: 1.  This potentially would not create a true net effect-  timing from the EOL trade and the phone call to execute the OTC could have price differences 2.  The confirmation process is impacted, would have to generate 2 confirms, one for each side of the trade 3.  Logistics would still have to nom and schedule for delivery both deals, may not be even volumes 4.  Settlements will see both invoices, again due to possible price and volume changes, will not be even netting The termination agreement would be the easiest process for the back office teams and would minimize the downstream effects to these processes.  The execution of termination agreements would be the strongest way to minimize our exposure to these deals since we have the Electronic Transaction Agreement in addition to the contract that governs the confirmation with the counterparty in place.   I know that commercial has a preference to option one but I want to make sure that all the issues are thought through with the possible impacts to the operations raised.  I've asked Scott Mills to explore Sitara for possible lock down of EOL deals after validation to ensure that there is tighter control over the deals for further exposure to potential modifications or kills.  Scott has indicated that the lock down of critical fields would be a big system change, but has agreed to review this and determine exactly what the IT estimates would be.  After we look at the Sitara requirements to support this change I will provide additional feedback. KC

Mark, Would appreciate a discussion on this. Thanks, Dave 
with companies on the ETA / PA changes Louise, No changes have been made to ETAs or PAs. In the case of National Power they requested an anodyne clarification of a clause in the ETA (one of the same points TXU required clarification - I had emailed Dave a copy of that letter). We are planning to send them a letter to that effect  (copy attached).  It does not constitute an amendment to the ETA.  As it hasn't yet been sent youself or Dave can veto it. Thanks, Edmund.

It has come to light that there have been a number of  EnronOnline transactions which have been ""undone"" after the fact. These are situations in which an EnronOnline trade has been completed, but we have agreed verbally with the other party that the trade will be deemed not have happened and we may have suppressed generation of a faxed confirmation. It is of great importance that we do not do anything which makes an EnronOnline trade appear as though it is not firm, or not reliable, or which affects the audit process. Therefore, EnronOnline transactions must not be killed. Individual traders might elect to conduct an OTC transaction which has the effect of reversing the impact of an EnronOnline transaction - this activity is outside the scope of EnronOnline. Please note that there has never been an instance in which there has been a system error on EnronOnline which caused a trade to take place which was not initiated by the customer. All instances to date have involved some kind of operator error, or failure to use the results of a Transaction Search to verify completed deals. Dave

Jay, On the Bid Submission Forms, please relocate the buttons to the bottom of the page and In place of where the buttons now appear, please insert: ""Please read the following Rules and scroll down to the buttons at the bottom of the page in order to submit your bid/offer"".

Looks good to me. Elisabeth: Thanks for your help in getting this through the approval process. I assume you be forwarding to legal? Thanks, Dave Elisabeth McCabe@ENRON 03/15/2000 08:03 PM 
Dave, I made a few edits that you can take or leave -- purely stylistic.  I'll work with John on anything further. 
Further to my converation with Mark Taylor, I understand that there are some potentially substantial changes to the Australian GTC in the works. Please advise as to when the redrafted GTC is expected to be available. If necessary, we will come into the office this weekend to upload it. Thanks, 
Further to my conversation this evening with David Minns: The cellphone connection was not good, however, I understand from my conversation with David that in his opinion, the current GTC would not preclude an international company from trading with Enron Australia on Australian Power. David mentioned that there are regulations which govern trading in Australia, which require that companies register with the Australian authorities. I assume, however, that these registration requirements would not apply to the counterparty if the counterparty were not located in Australia? (David, please confirm). David stated he would call Mark to discuss the GTC and (presumably) determine what action may need to be taken (if any) for Monday. I assume that whatever action is agreed, it will result in a situation in which international (non-Australian) companies can transact with Enron Australia on Australian financial power and that such action will be completed prior to Monday's launch. David/Mark: Please leave me a voice mail on 713 853 1861 or send an email as soon as the way forward is identified. Thanks, 
As I understand it, the current situation with regard to international companies being able to transact on Australian power is this: The only remaining potential issue is witholding tax. This may or may not be an issue and is being researched by Heidi Mason. If it is an issue, it is possible that we can borrow some language from the U.S. financial GTC. Heidi will coordinate with David Minns and suggest a solution (if required) for incorporation into the Australian GTC. An issue was raised with regard to ""Eligible Persons"", and the requirement that an ""Eligible Person"" hold more than $AUS 10 million. However, Tana Jones has been in discussion with David Minns on this issue and determined that the U.S. requirements are in fact more stringent than the Australian ones, hence the application of U.S. criteria for Financial trades should be more than sufficient to meet the Australian ""Eligible Persons"" requirements. Furthermore, a perusal of the approvals by credit indicate that no companies with an E-rating of less than 4 have been approved by credit. An issue was also raised with regard to settlements and the use of Austra-Clear. However, as we are unlikely to have large numbers of foreign companies transacting on Australian power in the near term, this should be a problem which can be resolved in the back office if it arises and should not impact the GTC, the planned Monday launch or the customer profiles. At this point, I am anticipating (possibly) having a witholding tax revision to the GTC, which will be uploaded to the system on Friday (Houston time). If anyone has any questions or concerns, please contact me on 713 853 1861 (office) or 713 562 8678 (cell). Thanks, 
Today we will: 1) Upload the GTC today with the revision noted below 2) Update the Australian Customer Profiles in accordance with the completed Credit/Legal/Contracts review. 3) Update the non-Australian Customer Profiles such that non-Australian customers have only read access. When we have clarification or an opinion with regard to: a) The procedure for determining whether or not a non-Australian Counterpart qualifies for Execute Access on Australian Power and; b) Determining whether or not tax clause changes to the GTC really are required; then we will: 4) Update the non-Australian Customer Profiles for Execute Access to Australian Power. Note: It is highly desireable to avoid making changes to GTC's once they are published - and certainly once they have been accepted by a company (i.e. a company which does not already have a signed Master Agreement with Enron), as this requires an awkward change notification process. Therefore, if the GTC/Tax issue can be resolved before Monday, it would be much appreciated. Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/17/2000 11:58 AM 
This will indeed be a St Patrick's Day for us to remember in years to come. Now that I am back in the office from Adelaide let me give some more considered replies. It appears there has been a bit a communication mix-up no doubt not helped by me being out of the office. So l let me go back to the beginning. Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. is authorised to trade Australian power derivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid out by the Government. These require "" that before entering into a contract with a counterparty, the registered facility provider (ie Enron Australia Finance) must be satisfied on reasonable grounds: (a) about the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and 
Dave I have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier: I spoke with David Minns re the 'Eligible Persons' criteria, and he noted that while he had discussed the capital/asset holding criteria with Tana, he had not provided to anyone the other criteria, and that while these may be covered by the US criteria, there will need to be a review of all criteria before we can assess that all are covered. I spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that provided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made, there will be no with-holding tax issues re the payments/receipts. I am going to meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to review the GTC. On the settlement issue, in the short term the best way to do the settlements for non-NEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston (this is how we settled our one previous cross border transaction) as this gives a third party review of the payments prior to release.

We actually did consider adding ""short"", but there is nothing on the site which identifies where the ""short description"" is (obvious to us, but not necessarily to the customer), so we decided to proceed without this (I realise the arguments are not very strong either way). It was felt at the time that ""Product Description"" would provide as much direction as ""Product Short Description"", so the language for NA products has been implemented in this way. Dave Edmund Cooper 03/17/2000 01:40 PM 
Fine.  If the dates are always going to be stated in the short description it would make sense to add ""short"" between ""product"" and ""description"", unless this causes a problem. Thanks, Edmund, Awais Omar 03/17/2000 01:27 PM

Awais, I have now made your requested changes in complex descriptions.  As mentioned in email below, I was not sure whether you wanted to remove the supply period information for UK and Cont Gas.  Mark suggested that I speak to Jonathan Whitehead to confirm that this information be left in the complex description.  Jonathan has said that he thinks that it should be there as long as legal have approved it. If the supply period text should be removed, please let me know and I will remove it.  Once this has been confirmed, do you then want me to go ahead and inform the traders that they can now start setting up their products with tokenised periods? Many thanks Anna 
I have made the relevant changes in complex descriptions.  Before I go ahead and inform the traders that they can set up their products for DA, BoM etc, could you take a look at the descriptions for UK Gas and Belgian Gas.  I have inserted the relevant term of transaction info (""The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the website"") but have not taken out the information on Supply periods (The Supply Period shall be for the gas Days commencing on the Saturday and Sunday following the trade date and any Friday and/or Monday, adjoining such Saturday and Sunday, which is not a Banking Day.). Does this info need to be deleted, or should it remain in all complex descriptions for UK and Cont Gas? Let me know and I will amend if necessary.

Mark, I agree with David's comments - and furthermore, I would like to find a solution which removed Australia from the day-to-day administration of customer profiles, if the Australian criteria can be applied from a simple ruleset. Adding another timezone to the process is not going to speed things up. Dave 
Mark I am most happy to provide administrative support as required but I would appreciate discussing this request with you. I am unsure as to what is expected. I have formally advised there are no restrictions on ""Australian based"" which I take to mean companies incorporated in Australia entering into foreign transactions. On a more general level I am facing a bit of a challenge with EnronOnline communications out of Houston. Last week I counted requests from 7 different persons in Houston all of who feel empowered to delegate tasks to or request legal advice from me. I find myself answering the same question several times and on occasions working with conflicting instructions.Clearly I recognise the need to provide legal support to Enronline and that last week was a bit extraordinary. But I believe the current arrangements can be substantially improved. Would it be possible to delegate some contact points? My clear preference on matters of an administrative nature would be to work through Paul Smith who is co-ordinating the implementation of EnronOnline. Interested in your thoughts. 
Further to discussions with Tana today: I understand there are some concerns with regard to the amount of time necessary to complete the due diligence process on each new company added to the EnronOnline customer list. Tana has requested that we adopt some rules which would reduce the amount of time spent on this activity. I am much in favour of this, but we need to ensure that the rules do not work such that many customers are prevented from transacting on products which they would otherwise be able to. e.g. Tana has suggested that companies who are not registered in the U.S. should automatically receive a profile which disallows them from trading in U.S. physical power, as they are unlikely to hold the required FERC license (subject of course to review of individual requests from the companies themselves). I am happy with this rule, as it seems highly unlikely that non-U.S. companies would hold a U.S. electricity license. If anyone would like to adopt similar rules for other products, please run them past me before implementation - assuming Mark and Justin are OK with the concept. Thanks, Dave

Mark, Do you have an ETA for the ETA and PA? Thanks, 
Mark, Attached is a copy of the OTC GTC which the Bandwidth group wishes to use for Bandwidth trading on EnronOnline, launching May 1. Could you please let me know which of your guys will be looking after reviewing/amending this for EnronOnline? Thanks, Dave 
David, Here's a first cut of the data to get us started.  Please have a look, and let me know what other blanks we will need to fill in as we go.  I've also looked at the additional considerations, and we should sit down and discuss some of these things with Jean sometime soon. Please review the attached documents, and I'll continue to refine them along the way.  Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for your help, Jay 
Mark, Louise is going to be in Japan on April 10 with Joe Hirl and Rebecca Mark to announce the launch of EnronOnline in Japan. Obviously, this means we need the ETA and PA very soon. Can we have reasonably final drafts by the end of this week? 
Mark, What differences are you expecting between the Master and a GTC? Can we not use the Master as the basis for a GTC? Dave Mark Taylor 03/29/2000 01:16 AM 
I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for bandwidth.  I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last week.  My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC. David Forster 03/27/2000 04:26 PM

Mark, Are you happy with the GTC changes and can we upload the new GTC to the system? Dave 
Thanks for your input. On the issues you raised following are my comments 1. The only change is the new tax clause which is paragraph 2.5 2. I will leave it to out tax experts to confirm the arrangements but I believe the tax treatries are limited to the countries I listed. As far as procedures are concerned I would be looking for signoff from tax. Either Susan Musch or PW. 3. refer 1 above 4.Yes I can make this determination. 5. Clause 2  of the ETA will be of great assistance but we cannot avoid our responsibility entirely, particularly where there are reasonable grounds to assume a party is not trading as a principal As I am in Houston can we get together to discuss.

Password Deletion It has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar to their User ID's for internal EnronOnline applications (Stack Manager, Product Manager, EOL Reports). This is a significant security concern. Therefore, there will be a sweep of ID's and passwords at the end of the day on Thursday, April 5. Any User ID's which have passwords similar to the User ID will be subject to deletion. Changing Your Password Passwords can be changed in either the Stack Manager or in EOL Reports. To change your password in the Stack Manager, once logged on, go to toolbar & select ""Help"" and then select ""Change Password"". The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice. To change your passsword in EOL Reports, open the Reports application, log in, select ""Options"" and ""Change Password"".The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice. Please note that the password change functionality within the Reports application is new.

I am not aware of any services associated with EnronOnline which the Japanese office might provide which could be the subject of such fees. Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/01/2000 06:17 PM 
Mario, Yes, we should be ready to go, although the law firm we are using in Japan (Baker & McKenzie in Tokyo) have indicated that they still have a few open issues to follow-up on. Baker & McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron non-Tokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty, that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax.  Further, they have advised that consumption tax (Japan's 5% VAT) should not apply to financial transactions, although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the 5% consumption tax. Baker & McKenzie have advised that they need to do some follow-up work with respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where our non-Japan trading offices are located.  I expect to have their response shortly. One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other Enron trading offices.  In this case, it may be appropriate for Enron Japan to receive a service fee for such services.  I am in the process of determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.  I will let you know of any additional developments as soon as they occur. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 05/01/2000 02:50 PM 
Susan, Following up on David's email, I understand we are ready to go, right? Mario 
Mario is away until next week. The Japanese could trade with any Enron office which is posting commodities on EnronOnline - but are most likely to be interested primarily in the products posted by Singapore (global products), as it provides the best timezone overlap. Both physical and financial are possible, but none of the physical delivery locations on EnronOnline are currently in Japan. Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/27/2000 12:38 PM 
Mario, Thanks for your e-mail.  I wanted to follow up on one more point just to make sure we have everything covered for May 1st.  Do we expect the Japanese to do online trading with the other Enron trading offices?  If so, which offices would they be trading with and what kind of products would be traded?  For example, would there be physical settlement (or delivery) of product in Japan to the Japanese customers or would there be only financial derivatives traded? I really appreciate your help on this. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/27/2000 10:55 AM 
Susan, Your understanding is correct. Thanks, Mario Parra Cardoso EnronOnline Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/27/2000 10:46 AM 
I have a conference call set up with our Japanese tax counsel this evening (Thursday evening Houston time).  After the call, I should be able to confirm that there are no major Japanese tax issues once our Japan office commences trading with Japanese counterparties through Enron Online. However, I understand that initially, the Japan Online implementation will only entail Japanese counterparties trading internationally (e.g. trading non-Japanese products).  Based on this assumption, I think we're okay for Monday from a Japanese trading office perspective.  Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/26/2000 03:34 PM 
Jeff, The marketing material is on its way to Tokyo. This Friday it is expected to be sent to clients. As you can see, time is something that we don't have. Could you please let us know if we are OK to go with the Japanese launch? Thanks, Mario 
Jeff, You are right. For the launch of EnronOnline in Japan, local clients will be offered the ability to trade existing EOL products. Japanese products will be offered in  the future. Please be advised, though, that Singapore products are likely to be added to EnronOnline before the Japanese launch. We expect Japanese clients to trade Singapore products, in addition to the ones currently available. Thanks, Mario Jeff Blumenthal@ECT 04/19/2000 03:18 PM 
Mario, We have begun discussions with a Tokyo law firm regarding the various Japanese tax issues related to EnronOnLine.  In that vein, can you please clarify whether ENA will be offering certain Japanese counterparties the ability to trade existing EOL products (i.e., products that are not Japanese-based) and that such offering will commence in May, 2000, while no Japanese products will be offered until sometime in the future? If you would, please reply to all listed above so that we can hold discussions this evening with out Japanese tax advisors. Thanks for your help, and best regards, Jeff Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/19/2000 10:12 AM 
Jeff, Japan is obviously the country that worries me the most since we intend to launch the site for Japanese clients in May. The marketing material is expected to be sent by late next week. Please let me know how long the process for Japan may still last and if you anticipate problems. Brazil and Argentina are expected be launched this summer. Thanks, Mario Jeff Blumenthal@ECT 04/19/2000 09:34 AM 
Mario, We've begun working with our outside tax advisors.  I understand the urgency of this matter and will see that it is moved along as quickly as possible. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/17/2000 04:07 PM 
Jeff, Anything new on tax issues related to EnronOnline for the countries above mentioned? Thanks, Mario 
Tana, Can you coordinate with David on the procedures? Thanks, Dave 
David, Thanks for the new GTC. We'll get things rolling at our end for the upload of new GTC and customer profiles. I think the ABN number might be better suited to the Registration form . . . Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/30/2000 10:32 PM 
Attached is the revised GTCs that address taxation issues for non-Australian resident counterparties. These GTCs have received tax clearance and hence all approvals have now been given to allow them to be loaded. Enclosed also are the procedures that need to be followed when new counterparties are being considered. To date we have been vetting potential counteparties in the Sydney office. I suggest that the procedures be made available to anyone else who may be given this responsibility. One new matter has come to light. In July 2000 with the introduction of GST in Australia new legislative arrangements will come into place. They will require businesses to have an ""ABN"". It has been suggested that we amend the password application to request the counterparty's ABN. 
Mark, Looks like interest in Mexico is increasing. Can we please complete the preparation of an ETA/PA? Thanks, 
I agree with Leslie - and we need to be careful about names Affiliates, too. Each Master User ID is intended for use by one legal entity. If the Affiliate is just a trading name and is the same legal entity, then we are OK - but if they are a separate legal entity, then we have problems with: a) The ability of one entity to bind another b) Credit headroom allocations and netting between entities. We should restrict the Master User ID and ETA to be applied to a single legal entity only. Dave Leslie Hansen@ECT 05/08/2000 11:44 AM 
Carol, I am not comfortable with an exclusion of affiliates from Section 2(a).  Instead, I think we need to include an express carve out that provides that the CP cannot utilitize the Website on behalf of third parties except for [Name of Principals] pursuant to [Name of Agency Agreement]. Leslie Carol St Clair 05/05/2000 09:28 AM 
David: GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA: 1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the Website password?] 2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a similar indemnity. I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1? Carol 
Mark, Just ensuring you are in agreement with what I am seeing in Brazil: - Andrea Bertone is legal counsel in Brazil who is working with you on EnronOnline. - Pinherio Neto is outside legal counsel for EnronOnline in Brazil. 
Mark, Attached is an early draft of text for the proposed TransWestern Capacity Auction site. I am sending it to you now only to give you a heads-up that this is in the works and is referred to in the document as a ""Transwestern"" Auction, as opposed to an Enron Auction. Leonardo is the point man on this. 
So, basically we're OK for current plans - although credit should be aware = of=20 A3? Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/11/2000 10:47 AM 
I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their= =20 final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese= =20 trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20 summary of their advice: A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions 1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20 swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment= =20 flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that= =20 Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput= ed=20 interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta= x. 2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a= re=20 generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20 transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20 imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t= he=20 subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such= =20 excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and= =20 delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20 financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices. 3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20 connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20 arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20 Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and= =20 pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20 withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer. B. Physically Settled Transactions 1. Consumption Tax Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an= d=20 on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab= le=20 to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit= e,=20 including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20 paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20 provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20 Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base= d=20 customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20 capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a= nd=20 then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20 If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20 commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20 required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20 consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a= n=20 arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20 resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption= =20 tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer. 2. Excise Tax Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20 commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum= =20 products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon= =20 the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20 coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20 petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t= o=20 excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities= =20 before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a= nd=20 has responsibility for payment of excise taxes. C. Tax Representations The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20 Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in= =20 force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20 entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20 representations may provide that: (1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl= y=20 and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and (2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20 entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article= =20 of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in= =20 the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20 Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati= on=20 or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t= o you. Best regards, Susan 
Carol, - Do we really want to accept arbitration in Portland? - What is our exposure to Federal Law? Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/11/2000 10:05 AM 
David: Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
- Paragraph 3: Same concern as in last email. - Paragraph 4: Are we happy to forego the application of the liabilities clause whenever a Counterparty does a transaction under a Master agreement, instead of a GTC? Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/11/2000 07:12 PM 
David: Enclosed is a new draft of the Kennecott amendment letter.  Mark and I have discussed the counterparty termination language and have come up with the language that I have high;lighted.  Upon your approval, I plan to use the same language for the Duke and Cinnergy letters. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Mark, Here are some descriptions which will be helpful on the Determination Period issue which London Global Products have. Thanks, Dave 
As long as our omission by way of (for example) not having high enough security is not enough to impact the liability clause, then I guess I am OK 
Dave: 1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be. 2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided nature of the indemnity language. Carol David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:26 PM 
Couple of questions: - What is the intention of the first paragraph? - So, does Paragraph 4 roughly translate to: ""Counterparty is allowed to whack us if we don't have high enough security""? Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/11/2000 03:18 PM 
David: Enclosed is a draft of the GPU Energy ETA amendment letter.  Leslie Hansen is working with them on the ""affiliate"" issue so there may be more to add to it.  Please let me know if you are okay with these amendments. carol 
Steve, Since our phone call, I spoke to Mark Taylor, who advised me that the local counsel is planning to come back to us next week with a detailed opinion regarding the taxation issues for trading in Brazil and Argentina. Under these circumstances, it seems wise to postpone our planned conference call until after outside counsel has responded. However, I remain concerned about this issue. As discussed, if we are unable to formulate a plan which we believe has a good chance of succeeding, and if the tax regime is so penal as to make trading on EnronOnline prohibitively expensive, then we need to seriously reevaluate the timetable for EnronOnline and postpone preparation efforts until such time as either the tax regime changes or we identify a way around the tax restrictions. I will contact you later next week after we hear from outside counsel. Hopefully their response will put my concerns to rest. 
As per my voice mail . . . 
Dave: Attached please find my proposed additions to the letter drafted by Carol St. Clair in response to comments from GPU Energy.  Please note that this counterparty does not enter into transactions on its own behalf but rather as an agent on behalf of several utiltities.  Please review the attached documents and call me so that we can discuss your comments and/or concerns. Leslie 
Mark, I am wondering if it is necessary to include a few more words in our index descriptors. When we refer to a published index, should we add: ""including published corrections"", or is this obvious enough? I'm thinking that if there is an error in the index which is acknowledged as such in the publication, then the error would be seen as something which should be corrected if we ever went to court. I'm also thinking that we would not want to apply this kind of language on a go-forward basis, as to have two different treatments might prejudice our position (although the UK office wishes to add this language on a go-forward) Thoughts? 
We have set a target date of June 12 for the Transwestern Auction site to be available to customers. At this date, we will need to be publishing ETA's and PA's which reference EnronOnline, rather than Enron North America. Please advise if you anticipate any difficulties in getting the incorporated EnronOnline into place under Enron Corp. with appropriate ETA and PA assignments completed by this date. If it is possible to have things in place sooner, obviously that would give us more breathing space. . . Thanks, 
Mark, We intend to relax the Read-Only restrictions on credit derivative products so that all customers will have Read Only Access (currently they do not). We are not changing Execution status at this point. Any objections? 
Bryan, I was mistaken - the updates have not actually occurred yet - but are likely to be in very shortly (within the next day or two) Dave 
Bryan, As discussed previously, we have modified the customer profiles to allow read only access to credit derivatives as a standard default for all customers. We have not modified any criteria for execution access. Dave 
This looks to me like it's just a wild rumour, but I thought I'd pass it along just in case anyone else has heard anything. From John Chismar: "" . . .I was out to lunch today with some traders and one of them questioned whether or not Platt's had contacted us yet.  His comment was that Platts was preparing to launch an offensive against all E trade systems that use Platt's as a settlement.  They want to claim a royalty or commision for each deal transacted.   Must be something to it as he claims there is a precedent - Platt's is owned by Mcgraw Hill and they publish the S & P index and supposedly  won a lawsuit for all trades done vs that Index.   Just thought I would pass this on to you as not sure if you were aware about this or if we 
Comments: 1) Enron Net Work should probably be EnronOnline, LLC 2) 1. What is a Passport Application? 3) 3.  I agreed we wouldn't pass along any details of any bids to ENA employees. I don't know what all of this paragraph entails. Can you shed some light, or should we just ask them to reword it? Dave 
Amita, Credit Risk - I am of a mind for Enron to accept the credit risk of metals transactions done through EnronOnline, bearing in mind that it will be Enron credit  criteria which is applied, the short timeline and the fact that this sleeving agreement is intended to be a temporary arrangement until conclusion of the final purchase agreement. If it can be set up so they take the risk, then fine - but don't allow this to delay the process. Confidentiality - I assume we are covered by the current C.A. Please confirm with Eric Gadd. Performance - Enron's obligation is to the customer and MG's obligation is to us. Invoices - Probably  prepared by MG and sent on Enron letterhead. We can download EnronOnline Transaction info. to MG if required. Please check with backoffice on this. Position - Assumed by MG Data Feeds - as normal for EnronOnline, with the addition of the financial product price and volume info. which we have discussed. Compensation for credit risk - See above note Dave Amita Gosalia@ECT 06/12/2000 03:53 PM 
Hi Guys Please see below (and in Lara's email) some of the issues we thought needed to be addressed in the ""back to back"" agreement between Enron and MG. Possibility of indemnity from MG re counterparty credit risk being held by Enron (in the event that no compensation is payable)? Please notify Edmund if there are any other issues which need to be covered in this document. Regards Amita 
All, I realise this is an aggressive timeframe, but it is important that we prove to both MG and outside observers that Enron can quickly and efficiently enter new businesses and put them onto EnronOnline. Successfully putting MG onto EnronOnline in record time will pay dividends as investors start to appreciate the EnronNetWorks strategy and the broader Enron model. Thanks to everyone who is working hard to make this happen. Dave Amita Gosalia@ECT 06/12/2000 04:38 PM 
Hi Guys As a result of the change in plan detailed below we will need the following additional work to be completed: - Legal counsel to be instructed to carry out due diligence for jurisdictions which are not currently covered and appear on the initial ""A"" list - see Justin's  email to Mark Taylor - Metals due diligence for all existing jurisdictions - Finalisation of GTCs - need draft by Friday 16th i.e this week! Please let me know if you have any queries. Regards Amita 
Hi Guys Slight change of plan on the counterparty front - we will be offering all metals products (currently two phys products) to the following counterparties: - All companies on new ""A"" list  (see Enron aluminium list.doc and Enron copper list.doc below) - All companies on the old ""A"" list (where we have a PA for the countries they are trading from)  (see tif file below) - All exisiting companies on EnronOnline (list as in EOL - copy will be forwarded as soon as avail) Please be aware that the companies on the new ""A"" list may be a subset of the companies on the old ""A"" list. Please proceed with your review process on the basis of the above. Both ""A"" lists are attached below for your ease of reference. Regards Amita - Enron aluminium list.doc - Enron copper list.doc Old A list 
Edmund: Mexico is already underway. Bruce: Can you comment on the relative importance of the following countries to MG's business? It costs us about GBP 15,000 to add each country (due diligence and document preparation costs). I may also be able to add a comment on Korea by tomorrow. Chile Brazil Peru Korea Republic of China Dave Edmund Cooper@ECT 06/14/2000 12:58 PM 
Dear Jonathan, Following our earlier telephone conversation, here is the list of countries for which we need to undertake follow-up commodity due diligence for trading physical metals products.  As the initial two products to be offered are aluminium and copper we should restrict the due diligence to base metals only.  In addition, let's ask for the position on cash-settled derivatives - should involve only a follow-up question asking whether previous advice for energy commodity derivatives changes in respect of derivatives on metals. However, the initial focus should be on the physical trading questions. Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom Also, there is the following list of countries, for which there is currently EOL access documentation which will need to have the same review. Mark - do you want us to handle the due diligence over here, or do you want to run with it? Australia Canada Japan United States There is a third list of countries for which we currently do not have EOL access documentation. Dave/Amita/Mark - Are we going to proceed with preparing such access documentation for these countries? Chile Brazil Peru Mexico Korea Republic of China Regards, Edmund 
Robert, Please be advised that Japan already has ETA's and PA's. It costs approx. GBP 15,000 to add each new country. Please let us know which ones you are happy to have charged to your RC and we'll commence legal due diligence on any you specify. Dave Robert Quick@ECT 06/14/2000 01:36 PM 
I have trawled through the list of jurisdictions of potential counterparties to the freight swaps/options. A list Norway Denmark Germany Switzerland UK Belgium France Netherlands Singapore Australia We have already done full EOL due diligence on the above jurisdictions. The only issue which we wd just need to cover is whether for regulatory purposes freight is treated as a commodity. We shd be able to get answers on that issue quickly. B list Turkey Taiwan Japan Argentina Israel Gibraltar S. Korea We do not have much on the above jurisdictions here although Mark T may have done some due diligence on the non- European, non-middle eastern countries. Do you want us to undertake full due diligence on these? C list Liberia Panama Cayman Isl BVI Bermuda Bahamas BWI I understand that decisions may have already been made not to include entities incorporated into these jurisdictions, because of money laundering issues, lack of corporate transparency etc. Cd this be confirmed. Many thanks Robert 
Mark, Hope this is useful to proceed with due diligence and PA/ETA preparation. Dave

Hi Guys Greg requested a press release re metals transactions on EnronOnline. I have made some amendments to the original press release prepared by Eric Thode and have amended the EnronOnline stats to reflect the stats contained in the most recent public report. Could you please review the draft and forward comments asap. Thanks Amita 
Mark, Could you please update me on the status of due diligence and document preparation for Chile, Peru and Korea? Thanks, Dave 
Mark, Can you commence the process for ETA's and PA's for Bermuda? Please advise as to how long you think this may take - and if the cost to us is likely to exceed $US 22,000 Thanks, Dave 
Dave, we'll pay the 15,000 pounds for the research on Bermuda law so that Bermuda companies like Commercial Risk can transact on Enron OnLine. 
Noticed you were not copied . . . Dave 
Let me add a couple of observations to Alan's explanation. There will be different GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products. However as it is planned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance Pty.Ltd. as the Enron contracting party and have designate New South Wales (an Australian State) as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical. The only differences currently relate to different data sources. There may also be additional changes that come out of the B&M review to accommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the incorporated in Japan. Hence we would want to take all possible steps to ensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the possibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation. Furthermore although any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a counterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a transaction would be relevant. However, there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for conformity with Japanese law. Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated company may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude derivatives or US power. Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs the appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular Japanese counterparty to trade particular products. This is the process that is currently followed. Accordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded. The Japanese weather GTCs are awaiting B&M signoff. 
Dave, Here are all the Online docs in both Word and HTML format!  We have not been able to put the PAs for Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain onto one page; we also had problems the with table in the US Coal GTC.  I suggest that someone with Web text editing expertise has a go at them. I've included the new Canadian Gas GTCs (NIT Gas and Canada Gas) and the replacement US Coal GTC. But not, the power GTCs sent over earlier or the other US Gas GTCs.  I'm awaiting instruction in accordance with my earlier emails. Thanks Edmund.

Mark, Just a heads - up that Molly Sample from EOTT may be contacting you regarding the possibility of putting an EOTT product onto EnronOnline through a sleeving company. Savita Putigai is running with this from the EnronOnline commercial perspective. 
Mark and I are both unable to attend at that time. Can we reschedule for either 11:00 or after 3:30 Houston time? I assume also that Andrea will attend. I would very much like her input, as I understand she is the one who raised the enforceability issue. Dave Patrick Hansen 07/31/2000 09:02 AM 
Mark and Dave, Last week, we met with a local ""Certifying Company"" called GIRE. Their service is based on the ""Asymmetric Password Method"" . We believe that using their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative. Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please confirm. Regards Patrick

I think we need for this to be reciprocal -although I agree the errors are= =20 likely to be only our own. Therefore, I suggest the following: (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, any master agreement o= r=20 any GTC to the contrary, any Transaction resulting from a Gross Error may  = be=20 voided and the parties agree that any such voided Transaction shall be of n= o=20 force or effect.  =01&Gross Error=018 shall mean the posting of any price t= hat is=20 [5]% or more above or below then prevailing market prices, which difference= =20 is verified by the average of quotations from three or more participants in= =20 the relevant market for Transactions which would be conducted at the time o= f=20 the Transaction containing the Gross Error. For a Transaction to qualify as= =20 subject to Gross Error, one party must communicate by facsimile to the othe= r=20 the claimed existence of Gross Error within [3] hours of the Transaction=20 occurring.=20 What do you think? Dave 
The problem with using something other than a quantitative measure (like percentage) is that we quickly get into something to argue about with the customer. Some alternatives off the top of my head to get the ball rolling: - Gross Error determined by independent arbitrator or possibly an appointed third party (auditor?) - Transaction which differs by more than x% from verified other transactions between independent companies during the same period (not just quotations). - Transaction which does not lie within the boundaries of other transactions between independent companies which occurred on that day. - Transaction which does not lie within the bid-offer hi and lo range identified by industry price reports published for that day. (obvious limitations here) Dave Louise Kitchen@ECT 08/22/2000 02:35 PM 
Is there not something better than a percentage?  Noticce the lack of a better answer from me. Andy Zipper@ENRON 22/08/2000 11:44 
I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is commercially reasonable. 
Further to Louise's suggestion: On selecting ""Create Price Limit Order"" from the submission window, a link should appear titled ""How Price Limit Orders Work"". Suggest a location immediately below the bar containing the ""Create Submission"" and ""Create Price Limit Order"" buttons. When this link is pressed, a popup window should appear containing the following text: Price Limit Orders allow you to place an offer to buy or sell at a price which is not currently available. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume available. This submission will remain active until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the hours and minutes you specify in your submission, (ii) Your cancellation (by highlighting the submision and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. Price limit orders are processed automatically by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit order, while your price limit order does not complete. 
DAve - this won't work its too long - you need a phrase -""How this works) which is a hyper text link to the majority of this wording CAn you please sort out. Teresa Smith@ENRON 23/08/2000 18:56 
How do you want us to handle the price limit order submission text?  See Mark's e-mail below.  I believe in the meeting this afternoon we talked about reducing the amount of text in the submission screen and creating a link to a separate section for the remainder of the information. -Teresa

Hi Guys As you are aware some of the metals counterparties we have heard from conduct two types of business: - proprietary trading for own book - brokerage for customers It has been decided to give such metals brokers only, access to metals products on EnronOnline for trading purposes. Can you please let me know whether you have any specific reasons why we should not go ahead with this course of action. Be aware that some of these brokers will be clearing their business through LCH.  This would entail tagging deals with such counterparties in the back office systems and relabelling the cpy as LCH. Look forward to hearing from you. Regards Amita 
It has come to my attention that when we have a Financial Master Agreement in place, we have identified that a Master exists for the Weather Products. This is not correct as the ISDA Masters do not properly cover weather. For Weather transactions, we need to use either the GTC or a weather-specific Master Agreement. Frank: Could you please arrange to identify which companies have already transacted on weather and have done so ostensibly under an ISDA?  Could you please also coordinate with Mark as necessary to update Customer Profiles so that customers with ISDA's will need to accept GTC's? If we have customers who have ostensibly transacted already under their ISDA's, let's identify who they are and then decide on a course of action for their profiles. Thanks, Dave 
Mark, Hope you had a good trip back. Please let me know if you need a hand finding the Fred Lagrasta newsletter on EnronOnline and/or if you are concerned by its contents. Thanks, 
Mark, I was looking through our list of PA's and was struck with the following questions: - Why did we decide to use ENA, Enron Power Operations and Enron Australia Pty as the three Enron companies which appear on the PA's? Political? - Why do the EPOL and EAP PA's say ""for itself and on behalf of its group undertakings from time to time"" (shouldn't the ENA ones say that as well?) - Is there any reason why we shouldn't update all of the PA's for EnronOnline LLC as the Enron company? - Should the EnronOnline PA (For U.S.) also say ""for itself and on behalf of its group undertakings from time to time""? 
Mark, There are some changes to this which are coming, but this is pretty much what we are looking to build. See you at 10:00. Dave 
For your review. 
Mark, Can you please start putting together documentation for the following? - Pipeline Capacity Trading ETA (to appear on the new capacity trading website) - Pipeline Capacity Trading Service Contract (entered into on paper with piplelines wishing to post their capacity on EnronOnline I imagine the ETA will be modeled pretty closely on the existing ETA. For the Service Contract, I assume we will be covering things like: - Nature of the Service (what we will do and what they will do) - They will -Post products on EnronOnline - Take responsibility for their prices - Be bound by any transactions which result, subject to their Tariff schedules. - Pay for any hardware needed at their end and/or any 3rd party connection costs (e.g. internet service providers) - We will - Provide the software - Host and maintain the database - Facilitate access to the application - Administer User ID's - Provide support for Product creation - Representation, warranties and limitations of our liability for the service - Confidentiality I assume we may need to sit down and discuss in more detail. I will forward the latest copy of our functional spec.  Please call and let me know what I can do to help in putting the above together. Thanks, 
Stephanie, Attached please find the latest version of the Capacity Specs. Please note that we have added a new application (see number 7). Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! Leonardo Pacheco ext. 39938 
Contracts on Platts Benchmarks 
Mark, If Platts is licensing their information for use in the eNymex platform, do= es=20 that change the legal picture with regard to EnronOnline's use of Platts (o= r=20 any other) indices for settling our transactions? Do we have any exposure here? Dave 
I have asked that Hong Kong be removed from the list of online PA's, effective for tonight. This does not prohibit us from distributing PA's directly, if it is decided that direct distribution is OK. However, I am keen to answer the following questions as soon as possible, so we can establish whether or not the PA can be put back on: 1) Does listing a PA for Hong Kong constitute ""targetting"" Hong Kong residents? 3) Does the Protection of Investors Ordinance apply to EnronOnline or the products contained on EnronOnline? 2) What are the HK Securities regulations and what is requried for compliance? Is this painful, or do we qualify with little effort? 4) What happens if we come to the attention of the HK regulator? Does it just mean some ""getting to know you"" meetings, or something more serious? 5) Is the Protection of Investors Ordinance aimed at individuals, or is it intended to cover companies as well? Dave

Mark, Should plastics/pulp&paper be included under the standard NA financial? Dave 
it appears we have no precipitation gtcs - from lawyers comments here, all weather matters are referred back to and driven from the US where they have never asked for precipitation products to be offered. Do we take them out? Plastics and pulp/paper need to fit under financial as there is nothing specific for them. (they are all financial products) m ps - i assume they are not covered by  the standard 'financial' 
I have reviewed the MasterProductData Spreadsheet (MPS - the version held by Mark Taylor) against the Enron North America Corp. Spot GTC for natural gas. Many of the defined terms on the GTC are not referenced or (in some cases) not quantified by the MPS. This could obvously give rise to confusion and possibly disputes with customers, revolving around central commercial terms. I have prepared two emails - one for Andy/Elena/Mark, who are responsible for the MPS and one for Stacy, who I understand is responsible for the legal review of the MPS and the GTC. Each email contains more detailed comments and will be sent to you shortly. I would appreciate it if responses could be incorporated into the MPS by Wednesday, Sept. 1 at the latest. Note that wherever possible, I have suggested amendments which preserve the logical structure of the MPS, so as to minimize any delay to the project which these changes could cause. For the next week, I will be available in Houston at 31861, or international cell at 011 44 7867 550 598. Thanks, 
I have reviewed the U.S. Gas GTC against the MasterProductsData Spreadsheet (MPS) and have the following comments: 1) The only U.S. Physical Gas description is for Interruptible. I assume we should add a U.S. Physical Gas firm Product Type? 2) Andy: I note that the spreadsheet which Mark Taylor had does not include the shortdesc page, which contains the PAI keys. I believe this is the same spreadsheet as was given to the other U.S. lawyers? It will be very difficult for the lawyers to complete a comprehensive review without this key, as it identifies the elements which need to be reviewed for each Product Type. Please forward a revised spreadsheet to each of the lawyers which contains this information. Thanks, Dave 
Further to the Legal Requirements in my last email: The following should be accomplished by Wednesday, to meet the upload deadline. I realise this is a tight deadline and appreciate your cooperation in addressing these concerns, which have only just recently come to light. 1) In the attached spreadsheet, identify the GTC which covers each Product Type for the GTC's which you have written. note I have completed the first U.S. Natgas as an example. Please email your update on this spreadsheet to Andrew Thomas. 2) The MasterProductData Spreadsheet (MPS) is attached. It contains a tab called Shortdesc. This tab shows a list of Product Types and an index of Product Additional Information (PAI) fields which apply to each Product Type. There are further tabs on the spreadsheet which correspond to the PAI's. The descriptions which appear to the customers on the website will be comprised of the Product description on the LongDesc tab and the descriptions from the applicable parts of the applicable PAI tabs.  I have confirmed that this spreadsheet contains all comments received to date, excluding financials, which we are working on seperately. Following is a suggested process: -  List all of the variables in the GTC which would need to be quantified or defined in the MPS. Think of the MPS as being the equivalent of the trader's conversation with the customer (which is reflected in a final confirmation), which covers the commercial, specific terms of the deal. - Compare this list with the MPS. Confirm that the language of the MPS conforms with the requirements of the GTC. Rember to check both the Product description found on the LongDesc tab as well as the tabs for each of the PAI's for that Product. The PAI's for each Product are listed on the ShortDesc page. - Don't worry about any missing entries for index types, locations, etc. These should be filled for accuracy and completeness by the confirmations groups. Any changes you make to Products language will be incorporated into any new additions. - Make any changes on the spreadsheet using a red font to highlight and email it back to Andrew Thomas. 3) Once the above is complete, and all additions from the confirmations groups have been incorporated, we will email back a complete set for final approval. Thanks, Dave 
Mark, Welcome back! I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of EnronOnline: 1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email) 2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved. It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access the long descriptions in the Product Manager 3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who should be looking after this? Mark Taylor Leslie Hansen Jeff Hodge Janice Moore Alan Aronowitz Harry Collins Stacy Dickson 4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's against the products and see what you think? Thanks for your help Dave 
Mark, We have identified an issue in the UK whereby we could sell an Option for Q3 (for example), which is really three 1-month options (July,Aug, Sept.). The option lanaguage needs to be clear that in the case of an option which has multiple election dates, the premium is paid up front for the set of options, but the payments which result from option settlement occur in each month during the option period. Justin and Edmund have suggested the attached. Do you want to modify the U.S. product descriptions in a similar way? Dave 
As per the request in your email today, attached please find a revised version of the Market Description for Weather Derivatives. I have run it by Lynda Clemmons and Steven Vu on our Weather Desk so consider the attached version approved by ENA Legal and Commercial. Kind regards, Shari Stack (Attorney for the Weather Derivatives Desk) 
Mark, In terms of the order for which we should look at things, I would suggest that we use the same order as the launch schedule -  effectively giving as much time as possible to review and change as required for each. Glad to hear that things are well in hand. Dave

It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access the long descriptions in the Product Manager 3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who should be looking after this? Mark Taylor Leslie Hansen Jeff Hodge Janice Moore Alan Aronowitz Harry Collins Stacy Dickson 4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's against the products and see what you think? Thanks for your help Dave 
Dave, Here are the reformatted additional US Gas GTCs (together with the Gas GTCs we already had - I renamed these to include 'Spot' in their titles). Edmund These are the new ones: These are the existing ones: 
Tana, State of incorporation has been captured for a large number of the counterparties and has been used as the basis for the determination of financial trading status by our tax group. If we are going to prevent a utility/gov/pension fund from trading financial products because of state law and we have state of incorporation, we should ensure that the entity we are barring is at least in the same state as the law in question. If this has not been the case, one way to update the information would be to list the states which have restrictive legislation and then apply the list to the companies for which we have state of incorporation information. An Excel Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial products for some utilities under certain circumstances. Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation information to Tana? One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this responsibility. Mark: Can you comment on this last point? Thanks, Dave Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Mark, Jennifer (PCG) has supplied me with example language from the confirmations which is representative of the the other confirmations. I agreed that you and I would rework a couple of examples for her, and then she can apply the same principles to the remaining descriptions. I think the best way to proceed on this is if we work up example wording for most of the different publication types, and/or verify any wording suggested by Jennifer against the original confirm language. I will bring up the originals to you, but my suggestion for a rework is: Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL): The Index shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day during the term of the transaction under the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" in the Oklahoma - PEPL section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a business day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding business day. Monthly price example (For NGI, Northern California Border): The Index shall be the ""Bidweek Average"" price for the Northern Cal Border Average as listed in the table entitled ""California Border & Non-Utility End-User Citygate tables"", published in the first issue in each month of Natural Gas Intelligence Weekly Gas Price Index for the term of the transaction. Monthly price example (For Inside Ferc, Texas,Oklahoma PEPL) The Index shall be the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co - Texas, Oklahoma (mainline) price as listed in the section entitled ""Prices of Spot Gas Delivered to Pipelines"", published in the first issue in each month of Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report for the term of the transaction. In each of the above examples, PCG will need to substitute the price name and section name for each of the applicable prices in each purblication. 
Jennifer, Here is the language which should be used for Gas Daily. It has been revised and approved by Mark Taylor: Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL): The Index for a day shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on such calendar day under the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" in the Oklahoma - PEPL section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a business day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding business day. Please proceed with subsituting as required to complete the index updates. Thanks, 
Mark, Please let me know when you want this language included (i.e. when you and= =20 others are happy with it) Thanks, Dave 
At Mark's request, I am transmitting proposed changes to the collateral=20 arrangement language in the Online GTC's.  Please let me know if it meets= =20 with your approval. 8.

I actually meant for new Masters only - not replacing existing ones. Dave Justin Boyd 06/10/99 10:10 
Dave - we did consider this at the time and decided not to proceed on the basisi of a formal amendment of each of the Masters, for the following reasons: It would take considerable time to prepare (particularly in the US where there are a much greater number of Masters) the necessary amendment agreements. Each Master would need to be separately considered and individual amendments prepared. The process of securing the agreement of each counterparty to an amendment would have delayed the Project In proposing a formal amendment, this would have meant identifying to the marketplace the Project. Clause 3 of the ETA sets out how we have dealt with the execution of trades online wherer existing Masters are in place. Regards Justin David Forster 06/10/99 08:51 
Just out of curiosity: The GTC's state that GTC's will be used ""Until a Master Agreement is executed"" . . . Do we need to modify our standard Master Agreements to be consistent with either the concepts or terms of EnronOnline? I realise we are willing to accept variations for existing master agreements, but I assume we would want to ensure that new Masters are as consistent as possible . . . Dave 
Edmund, Could you please confirm this wording is OK for Europe and amend the=20 w/collateral GTC's to incorporate the revision? The primary purpose of this change is to create a default event in the even= t=20 that the credit support defaults. Note: I have changed the last word in the clause from Transaction to GTC,= =20 with Mark Taylor's approval. Thanks, Dave

Thor, We are trying to globalise the GTC's so that a customer could transact on a particular weather product up to 24 hours per day and do so on similar terms and conditions, even if the product is being passed from one Enron office to another during the day. I have learned today that the legal resource we need to work on this will not be available until the first or second week of January, behind another weather project which is currently consuming their attention. We are trying to identify another resource which may be able to help (we need to coordinate legal response from each of the Enron offices), but so far, no luck. I had hoped we would be able to resolve this sooner, so that you would not have your customers accept a new GTC, and then have to accept it again in short order if we apply changes to the GTC in order to ""globalise"" it. If you want to proceed now with the current GTC, we can certainly do that. If you would prefer to wait for a globalised GTC, we can do that too - it's your call. Please advise how you would like to proceed. Dave Thor Lien@ECT 12/20/2000 01:20 AM 
Can everyone please respond to the GTC for Weather, because we need it ASAP to get our products set up for next year Thanks Thor Lien 
Thor Justin sent the GTCs to Mark Taylor (Houston) and David Minns (Sydney) and he has had no response.  Amita is going to follow up with Dave Forster to find out why we have to wait so long as he was the person who told Amita to get the GTCs globalised in the first place. Regards Arfan Thor Lien 20/12/2000 06:44

Mark, Are we considered to be 2nd or third tier under the new regulations? Can we obtain a summary of what the new regulations say? Dave

The Newsticker information will appear in both the House and Garden at the current time - we are unable to distinguish between the two at this time. Therefore, it would be available to all companies accessing our website, whether they are registered users or not. Dave Justin Boyd 05/11/99 10:15 
Dave, It is important to ensure that, to the best of our knowledge, Newsticker Information is accurately stated, current and consistent with other information on the website and in the GTCs, Long Descriptions, User Guide, etc. Nonetheless, we will want to be able to rely on the Legal & Privacy Statement, since this contains an exclusion of liability for the timeliness and accuracy of information on the website (para 4) and an exclusion of any warranties as to the completeness and accuracy of information (para 3). A couple of questions: Will Newsticker Information only be relevant and available to companies that are actually trading on-line? Where on the website will the ""link"" to Newsticker Information appear? {This is important for the purposes of the Legal & Privacy Statement} Regards Justin David Forster 04/11/99 23:40 
Mark/Justin, Obviously, we will need to have an appropriate examination of each data element, but do either of you foresee any complications with us providing information as per the attached via EnronOnline? I am wondering particularly about any liability we may have in the event that the information which we provide is late or wrong. Comments? Thanks, Dave 
Attached is a European spreadsheet which shows possible information items which we could carry on our news ticker. (industry-specific stuff like linepack). It breaks down the items by product grouping. If we want to proceed with putting this kind of info. on the ticker, we would have to acquire legal approval and buy-in from the people who would be responsible for updating the information. What do you think? Should we proceed with putting this kind of stuff on the site? Note that at the current time, it would have to appear in Garden. Dave 
Dave - give me a call at your convenience to discuss. (Note: the master file is in : T:/readwrite/web pricing / website content/ newsticker / Europe - ticker layout.xls) Thanks, P 
Is the PCG fellow who will be handling changes to the database long descriptions on an ongoing basis. I am being phased out of the loop as we move processes from the startup team to the operational team. 
Dale, The statement which Mark Taylor has/is referencing in his email to you is the following: The Floating Price shall be the average of the index for each day in the relevant Determination Period. This should be used for all U.S. and Canadian financial products except weather. Please see me if you have any questions. Thanks, 
Mark, Further to our discussion as to which licenses might have impact on 3rd party stack: Tibco (which you are already looking at) Oracle (is suspected to be a problem) Weblogic Apache (very low cost - prob. not a big concern) SSL does not require a license. I have requested license copies from Carmen Ayala. 
Mark, It appears there was a mixup in contracts admin. Copies of the licenses should be forthcoming shortly. What is the ETA for the legal analysis of the impact of becoming regulated - i.e. at what point are we subject to regulations, and what is the impact? 
I'm not too worried about this - the letter which Mark Taylor is preparing will state that whatever method we choose to use will supercede EOL - so if everything is set to GTC and the GTC flags are set to ""read"", that should be enough - unless someone is worried about the confirms. Dave 
Karen Lambert has indicated that we have Master Agreements between HPLC and ENA (physical) and between ENA and ECC (physical &financial).   We will need to populate the master agreements in EOL.  I need some direction relative to this to assure we sent it up correctly.  In addition, we will assign the short agreement you discussed a global id and populate this number in EOL for all desk to desk trades that are intra company. 
Dale, The following language can be added to locations which may attract LDC=20 imbalance charges. Can you identify those locations and add the language? Thanks, Dave 
Here is the language that we discussed: Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, Enron shall not be=20 responsible for any fees, penalties, cash or charges (in cash or in kind)= =20 assessed to Counterparty by a local distribution company for failure to=20 satisfy the local distribution company=01,s balance and or nomination=20 requirements. Stacy 
Pete, Please have a look at the attached to see if it complies with the commercial standards you use today. The ND is the only product of importance for tonight - the remainder we can discuss tomorrow, if you prefer. Thanks, Dave 
Just to confirm recent conversations: 1) At the current time, customers must accept the GTC for each new Product Type grouping (e.g. Belgian Gas Physical forward and Belgian Gas Physical Forward Option would each require acceptance of the same GTC). 2) We would like to keep the ""deal roadblocks"" to a minimum - e.g. we do not want to push customers into reviewing and accepting contracts more often than necessary. 3) We should change EOL so that when a GTC is accepted, all Product Types which reference that GTC will show that the GTC has been already accepted. If anyone disagrees with the above, please let me know ASAP, otherwise I will discuss making the change with Jay. Thanks, 
Here is a copy of the presentation. Please note that the two slides at the end are not intended to be used unless needed to address a specific question. Dave 
Mark, Please call me re: verbatim use of wording between EOL and Confirms. Also: PCGs are checking back with confirms people regarding index descriptions and location, to make sure things are properly covered off. They are also going through the descriptions to identify cases where traders have grabbed incorrect items against the products they have created. Additional system controls are going in today and into next week to stop this sort of error from happening. 
Mark, Can you update me as to the status on revising their ETA? Thanks, 
Mark, Please give your final approval for these similar letters: Thanks, 
The aforementioned letter: 
Bob, The attached letter format should be used for all of the companies which have not transacted online yet and for whom we wish the GTC to supercede an existing master agreement. It has been approved by Mark Taylor. This can be used for all such companies going forward. Thanks,

Mark, Could you please cast your eye over these additions to the FAQ list? Thanks, Dave 
Q1: Did you write your web page internally or use an outside company? A: Enron used an outside company for the web page coding, but the internal applications which our traders use for posting their bids and offers were built by Enron personnel. Q2: What is the name of the outside agency which Enron used for web page development and how can we contact them? A: The company which wrote the internet software for EnronOnline is Agency.com. Q3: Are you satisfied with Agency's performance? Refer the caller to our PR dept. David Forster 09/11/99 17:32 
OK - Q1 and Q3 obviously only need internal approval, but I will send Q2 to Agency, if you approve. Q1: Did you write your web page internally or use an outside company? A: Enron used an outside company for the web page coding, but the internal applications which our traders use for posting their bids and offers were built by Enron personnel. Q2: What is the name of the outside agency which Enron used for web page development and how can we contact them? A: The company which wrote the internet software for EnronOnline is Agency.com. They are located in Dallas, Texas and can be reached at 214-571-4000, or by mail at 1701 N. Market Street, Suite 400, Dallas, Texas 75202. Q3: Are you satisfied with Agency's performance?

As a result of a smooth launch and market demand, we are accelerating the timetable for the launch of several EnronOnline products. Specifically,  after the launch of U.S. power on Monday, Dec. 13th, we will be launching the following: Wednesday, December 15: US Coal, U.S. Plastics, US Pulp and Paper Thursday, December 16: Norwegian Power Although the legal review has been completed for all of the above, I would appreciate it if you would look once more at the products which are relevant to your area and confirm that you are happy with them (some of you are already in the process of doing so - thank you) We absolutely want to avoid making changes after launch due to the problems associated with changing descriptions on products which have already traded. The Product Long Descriptions can be seen in the Product Manager by expanding the Product Type in the tree to show each of the dependent Products, then right-clicking the Product, selecting View and then pressing the View Description button which appears on the pop-up window. Please contact myself or Dale Neuner if you have any comments. Thanks,

Dear Dave, Justin and I have had another look at the website and noticed that the old Legal & Privacy statement is the one being shown.  The additional language in the mark-up below needs to be added before European counterparties access the site to trade. In respect of Finland, we have been in contact with our Finnish legal advisers and hope to have the issue resolved (hopefully favourably) today. Thanks, Edmund. 
Dave, I've now been given access to the Online system, and I've also seen the website - it's all looking pretty good.  However, I noticed on reading through the Legal & Privacy statement that there is some text missing!! I've attached a mark-up showing the missing text (red and bold) which needs to be in there.

Steve, Since our phone call, I spoke to Mark Taylor, who advised me that the local counsel is planning to come back to us next week with a detailed opinion regarding the taxation issues for trading in Brazil and Argentina. Under these circumstances, it seems wise to postpone our planned conference call until after outside counsel has responded. However, I remain concerned about this issue. As discussed, if we are unable to formulate a plan which we believe has a good chance of succeeding, and if the tax regime is so penal as to make trading on EnronOnline prohibitively expensive, then we need to seriously reevaluate the timetable for EnronOnline and postpone preparation efforts until such time as either the tax regime changes or we identify a way around the tax restrictions. I will contact you later next week after we hear from outside counsel. Hopefully their response will put my concerns to rest. 
As per my voice mail . . . 
Dave: Attached please find my proposed additions to the letter drafted by Carol St. Clair in response to comments from GPU Energy.  Please note that this counterparty does not enter into transactions on its own behalf but rather as an agent on behalf of several utiltities.  Please review the attached documents and call me so that we can discuss your comments and/or concerns. Leslie 
Mark, I am wondering if it is necessary to include a few more words in our index descriptors. When we refer to a published index, should we add: ""including published corrections"", or is this obvious enough? I'm thinking that if there is an error in the index which is acknowledged as such in the publication, then the error would be seen as something which should be corrected if we ever went to court. I'm also thinking that we would not want to apply this kind of language on a go-forward basis, as to have two different treatments might prejudice our position (although the UK office wishes to add this language on a go-forward) Thoughts? 
We have set a target date of June 12 for the Transwestern Auction site to be available to customers. At this date, we will need to be publishing ETA's and PA's which reference EnronOnline, rather than Enron North America. Please advise if you anticipate any difficulties in getting the incorporated EnronOnline into place under Enron Corp. with appropriate ETA and PA assignments completed by this date. If it is possible to have things in place sooner, obviously that would give us more breathing space. . . Thanks, 
I am not aware of any services associated with EnronOnline which the Japanese office might provide which could be the subject of such fees. Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/01/2000 06:17 PM 
Mario, Yes, we should be ready to go, although the law firm we are using in Japan (Baker & McKenzie in Tokyo) have indicated that they still have a few open issues to follow-up on. Baker & McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron non-Tokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty, that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax.  Further, they have advised that consumption tax (Japan's 5% VAT) should not apply to financial transactions, although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the 5% consumption tax. Baker & McKenzie have advised that they need to do some follow-up work with respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where our non-Japan trading offices are located.  I expect to have their response shortly. One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other Enron trading offices.  In this case, it may be appropriate for Enron Japan to receive a service fee for such services.  I am in the process of determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.  I will let you know of any additional developments as soon as they occur. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 05/01/2000 02:50 PM 
Susan, Following up on David's email, I understand we are ready to go, right? Mario 
Mario is away until next week. The Japanese could trade with any Enron office which is posting commodities on EnronOnline - but are most likely to be interested primarily in the products posted by Singapore (global products), as it provides the best timezone overlap. Both physical and financial are possible, but none of the physical delivery locations on EnronOnline are currently in Japan. Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/27/2000 12:38 PM 
Mario, Thanks for your e-mail.  I wanted to follow up on one more point just to make sure we have everything covered for May 1st.  Do we expect the Japanese to do online trading with the other Enron trading offices?  If so, which offices would they be trading with and what kind of products would be traded?  For example, would there be physical settlement (or delivery) of product in Japan to the Japanese customers or would there be only financial derivatives traded? I really appreciate your help on this. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/27/2000 10:55 AM 
Susan, Your understanding is correct. Thanks, Mario Parra Cardoso EnronOnline Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/27/2000 10:46 AM 
I have a conference call set up with our Japanese tax counsel this evening (Thursday evening Houston time).  After the call, I should be able to confirm that there are no major Japanese tax issues once our Japan office commences trading with Japanese counterparties through Enron Online. However, I understand that initially, the Japan Online implementation will only entail Japanese counterparties trading internationally (e.g. trading non-Japanese products).  Based on this assumption, I think we're okay for Monday from a Japanese trading office perspective.  Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/26/2000 03:34 PM 
Jeff, The marketing material is on its way to Tokyo. This Friday it is expected to be sent to clients. As you can see, time is something that we don't have. Could you please let us know if we are OK to go with the Japanese launch? Thanks, Mario 
Jeff, You are right. For the launch of EnronOnline in Japan, local clients will be offered the ability to trade existing EOL products. Japanese products will be offered in  the future. Please be advised, though, that Singapore products are likely to be added to EnronOnline before the Japanese launch. We expect Japanese clients to trade Singapore products, in addition to the ones currently available. Thanks, Mario Jeff Blumenthal@ECT 04/19/2000 03:18 PM 
Mario, We have begun discussions with a Tokyo law firm regarding the various Japanese tax issues related to EnronOnLine.  In that vein, can you please clarify whether ENA will be offering certain Japanese counterparties the ability to trade existing EOL products (i.e., products that are not Japanese-based) and that such offering will commence in May, 2000, while no Japanese products will be offered until sometime in the future? If you would, please reply to all listed above so that we can hold discussions this evening with out Japanese tax advisors. Thanks for your help, and best regards, Jeff Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/19/2000 10:12 AM 
Jeff, Japan is obviously the country that worries me the most since we intend to launch the site for Japanese clients in May. The marketing material is expected to be sent by late next week. Please let me know how long the process for Japan may still last and if you anticipate problems. Brazil and Argentina are expected be launched this summer. Thanks, Mario Jeff Blumenthal@ECT 04/19/2000 09:34 AM 
Mario, We've begun working with our outside tax advisors.  I understand the urgency of this matter and will see that it is moved along as quickly as possible. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/17/2000 04:07 PM 
Jeff, Anything new on tax issues related to EnronOnline for the countries above mentioned? Thanks, Mario 
Mark, Looks like interest in Mexico is increasing. Can we please complete the preparation of an ETA/PA? Thanks, 
I agree with Leslie - and we need to be careful about names Affiliates, too. Each Master User ID is intended for use by one legal entity. If the Affiliate is just a trading name and is the same legal entity, then we are OK - but if they are a separate legal entity, then we have problems with: a) The ability of one entity to bind another b) Credit headroom allocations and netting between entities. We should restrict the Master User ID and ETA to be applied to a single legal entity only. Dave Leslie Hansen@ECT 05/08/2000 11:44 AM 
Carol, I am not comfortable with an exclusion of affiliates from Section 2(a).  Instead, I think we need to include an express carve out that provides that the CP cannot utilitize the Website on behalf of third parties except for [Name of Principals] pursuant to [Name of Agency Agreement]. Leslie Carol St Clair 05/05/2000 09:28 AM 
David: GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA: 1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the Website password?] 2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a similar indemnity. I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1? Carol 
Mark, Just ensuring you are in agreement with what I am seeing in Brazil: - Andrea Bertone is legal counsel in Brazil who is working with you on EnronOnline. - Pinherio Neto is outside legal counsel for EnronOnline in Brazil. 
So, basically we're OK for current plans - although credit should be aware = of=20 A3? Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/11/2000 10:47 AM 
I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their= =20 final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese= =20 trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20 summary of their advice: A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions 1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20 swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment= =20 flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that= =20 Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput= ed=20 interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta= x. 2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a= re=20 generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20 transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20 imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t= he=20 subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such= =20 excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and= =20 delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20 financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices. 3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20 connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20 arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20 Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and= =20 pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20 withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer. B. Physically Settled Transactions 1. Consumption Tax Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an= d=20 on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab= le=20 to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit= e,=20 including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20 paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20 provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20 Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base= d=20 customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20 capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a= nd=20 then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20 If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20 commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20 required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20 consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a= n=20 arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20 resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption= =20 tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer. 2. Excise Tax Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20 commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum= =20 products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon= =20 the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20 coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20 petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t= o=20 excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities= =20 before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a= nd=20 has responsibility for payment of excise taxes. C. Tax Representations The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20 Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in= =20 force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20 entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20 representations may provide that: (1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl= y=20 and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and (2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20 entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article= =20 of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in= =20 the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20 Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati= on=20 or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t= o you.

Carol, - Do we really want to accept arbitration in Portland? - What is our exposure to Federal Law? Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/11/2000 10:05 AM 
David: Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
- Paragraph 3: Same concern as in last email. - Paragraph 4: Are we happy to forego the application of the liabilities clause whenever a Counterparty does a transaction under a Master agreement, instead of a GTC? Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/11/2000 07:12 PM 
David: Enclosed is a new draft of the Kennecott amendment letter.  Mark and I have discussed the counterparty termination language and have come up with the language that I have high;lighted.  Upon your approval, I plan to use the same language for the Duke and Cinnergy letters. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
Mark, Here are some descriptions which will be helpful on the Determination Period issue which London Global Products have. Thanks, Dave 
As long as our omission by way of (for example) not having high enough security is not enough to impact the liability clause, then I guess I am OK 
Dave: 1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be. 2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided nature of the indemnity language. Carol David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:26 PM 
Couple of questions: - What is the intention of the first paragraph? - So, does Paragraph 4 roughly translate to: ""Counterparty is allowed to whack us if we don't have high enough security""? Dave Carol St Clair @ ECT                05/11/2000 03:18 PM 
David: Enclosed is a draft of the GPU Energy ETA amendment letter.  Leslie Hansen is working with them on the ""affiliate"" issue so there may be more to add to it.  Please let me know if you are okay with these amendments. carol 
Mark, We intend to relax the Read-Only restrictions on credit derivative products so that all customers will have Read Only Access (currently they do not). We are not changing Execution status at this point. Any objections? 
Bryan, I was mistaken - the updates have not actually occurred yet - but are likely to be in very shortly (within the next day or two) Dave 
Bryan, As discussed previously, we have modified the customer profiles to allow read only access to credit derivatives as a standard default for all customers. We have not modified any criteria for execution access. Dave 
This looks to me like it's just a wild rumour, but I thought I'd pass it along just in case anyone else has heard anything. From John Chismar: "" . . .I was out to lunch today with some traders and one of them questioned whether or not Platt's had contacted us yet.  His comment was that Platts was preparing to launch an offensive against all E trade systems that use Platt's as a settlement.  They want to claim a royalty or commision for each deal transacted.   Must be something to it as he claims there is a precedent - Platt's is owned by Mcgraw Hill and they publish the S & P index and supposedly  won a lawsuit for all trades done vs that Index.   Just thought I would pass this on to you as not sure if you were aware about this or if we 
Comments: 1) Enron Net Work should probably be EnronOnline, LLC 2) 1. What is a Passport Application? 3) 3.  I agreed we wouldn't pass along any details of any bids to ENA employees. I don't know what all of this paragraph entails. Can you shed some light, or should we just ask them to reword it? Dave 
Amita, Credit Risk - I am of a mind for Enron to accept the credit risk of metals transactions done through EnronOnline, bearing in mind that it will be Enron credit  criteria which is applied, the short timeline and the fact that this sleeving agreement is intended to be a temporary arrangement until conclusion of the final purchase agreement. If it can be set up so they take the risk, then fine - but don't allow this to delay the process. Confidentiality - I assume we are covered by the current C.A. Please confirm with Eric Gadd. Performance - Enron's obligation is to the customer and MG's obligation is to us. Invoices - Probably  prepared by MG and sent on Enron letterhead. We can download EnronOnline Transaction info. to MG if required. Please check with backoffice on this. Position - Assumed by MG Data Feeds - as normal for EnronOnline, with the addition of the financial product price and volume info. which we have discussed. Compensation for credit risk - See above note Dave Amita Gosalia@ECT 06/12/2000 03:53 PM 
Hi Guys Please see below (and in Lara's email) some of the issues we thought needed to be addressed in the ""back to back"" agreement between Enron and MG. Possibility of indemnity from MG re counterparty credit risk being held by Enron (in the event that no compensation is payable)? Please notify Edmund if there are any other issues which need to be covered in this document. Regards Amita 
All, I realise this is an aggressive timeframe, but it is important that we prove to both MG and outside observers that Enron can quickly and efficiently enter new businesses and put them onto EnronOnline. Successfully putting MG onto EnronOnline in record time will pay dividends as investors start to appreciate the EnronNetWorks strategy and the broader Enron model. Thanks to everyone who is working hard to make this happen. Dave Amita Gosalia@ECT 06/12/2000 04:38 PM 
Hi Guys As a result of the change in plan detailed below we will need the following additional work to be completed: - Legal counsel to be instructed to carry out due diligence for jurisdictions which are not currently covered and appear on the initial ""A"" list - see Justin's  email to Mark Taylor - Metals due diligence for all existing jurisdictions - Finalisation of GTCs - need draft by Friday 16th i.e this week! Please let me know if you have any queries. Regards Amita 
Hi Guys Slight change of plan on the counterparty front - we will be offering all metals products (currently two phys products) to the following counterparties: - All companies on new ""A"" list  (see Enron aluminium list.doc and Enron copper list.doc below) - All companies on the old ""A"" list (where we have a PA for the countries they are trading from)  (see tif file below) - All exisiting companies on EnronOnline (list as in EOL - copy will be forwarded as soon as avail) Please be aware that the companies on the new ""A"" list may be a subset of the companies on the old ""A"" list. Please proceed with your review process on the basis of the above. Both ""A"" lists are attached below for your ease of reference.

Edmund: Mexico is already underway. Bruce: Can you comment on the relative importance of the following countries to MG's business? It costs us about GBP 15,000 to add each country (due diligence and document preparation costs). I may also be able to add a comment on Korea by tomorrow. Chile Brazil Peru Korea Republic of China Dave Edmund Cooper@ECT 06/14/2000 12:58 PM 
Dear Jonathan, Following our earlier telephone conversation, here is the list of countries for which we need to undertake follow-up commodity due diligence for trading physical metals products.  As the initial two products to be offered are aluminium and copper we should restrict the due diligence to base metals only.  In addition, let's ask for the position on cash-settled derivatives - should involve only a follow-up question asking whether previous advice for energy commodity derivatives changes in respect of derivatives on metals. However, the initial focus should be on the physical trading questions. Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom Also, there is the following list of countries, for which there is currently EOL access documentation which will need to have the same review. Mark - do you want us to handle the due diligence over here, or do you want to run with it? Australia Canada Japan United States There is a third list of countries for which we currently do not have EOL access documentation. Dave/Amita/Mark - Are we going to proceed with preparing such access documentation for these countries? Chile Brazil Peru Mexico Korea Republic of China Regards, Edmund 
Robert, Please be advised that Japan already has ETA's and PA's. It costs approx. GBP 15,000 to add each new country. Please let us know which ones you are happy to have charged to your RC and we'll commence legal due diligence on any you specify. Dave Robert Quick@ECT 06/14/2000 01:36 PM 
I have trawled through the list of jurisdictions of potential counterparties to the freight swaps/options. A list Norway Denmark Germany Switzerland UK Belgium France Netherlands Singapore Australia We have already done full EOL due diligence on the above jurisdictions. The only issue which we wd just need to cover is whether for regulatory purposes freight is treated as a commodity. We shd be able to get answers on that issue quickly. B list Turkey Taiwan Japan Argentina Israel Gibraltar S. Korea We do not have much on the above jurisdictions here although Mark T may have done some due diligence on the non- European, non-middle eastern countries. Do you want us to undertake full due diligence on these? C list Liberia Panama Cayman Isl BVI Bermuda Bahamas BWI I understand that decisions may have already been made not to include entities incorporated into these jurisdictions, because of money laundering issues, lack of corporate transparency etc. Cd this be confirmed. Many thanks Robert 
Mark, Hope this is useful to proceed with due diligence and PA/ETA preparation. Dave

Mark, Just a heads - up that Molly Sample from EOTT may be contacting you regarding the possibility of putting an EOTT product onto EnronOnline through a sleeving company. Savita Putigai is running with this from the EnronOnline commercial perspective. 
Mark and I are both unable to attend at that time. Can we reschedule for either 11:00 or after 3:30 Houston time? I assume also that Andrea will attend. I would very much like her input, as I understand she is the one who raised the enforceability issue. Dave Patrick Hansen 07/31/2000 09:02 AM 
Mark and Dave, Last week, we met with a local ""Certifying Company"" called GIRE. Their service is based on the ""Asymmetric Password Method"" . We believe that using their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative. Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please confirm. Regards Patrick 
Mark, Could you please update me on the status of due diligence and document preparation for Chile, Peru and Korea? Thanks, Dave 
Mark, Can you commence the process for ETA's and PA's for Bermuda? Please advise as to how long you think this may take - and if the cost to us is likely to exceed $US 22,000 Thanks, Dave 
Dave, we'll pay the 15,000 pounds for the research on Bermuda law so that Bermuda companies like Commercial Risk can transact on Enron OnLine. 
Noticed you were not copied . . . Dave 
Let me add a couple of observations to Alan's explanation. There will be different GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products. However as it is planned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance Pty.Ltd. as the Enron contracting party and have designate New South Wales (an Australian State) as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical. The only differences currently relate to different data sources. There may also be additional changes that come out of the B&M review to accommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the incorporated in Japan. Hence we would want to take all possible steps to ensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the possibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation. Furthermore although any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a counterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a transaction would be relevant. However, there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for conformity with Japanese law. Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated company may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude derivatives or US power. Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs the appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular Japanese counterparty to trade particular products. This is the process that is currently followed. Accordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded. The Japanese weather GTCs are awaiting B&M signoff. 
I think we need for this to be reciprocal -although I agree the errors are= =20 likely to be only our own. Therefore, I suggest the following: (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, any master agreement o= r=20 any GTC to the contrary, any Transaction resulting from a Gross Error may  = be=20 voided and the parties agree that any such voided Transaction shall be of n= o=20 force or effect.  =01&Gross Error=018 shall mean the posting of any price t= hat is=20 [5]% or more above or below then prevailing market prices, which difference= =20 is verified by the average of quotations from three or more participants in= =20 the relevant market for Transactions which would be conducted at the time o= f=20 the Transaction containing the Gross Error. For a Transaction to qualify as= =20 subject to Gross Error, one party must communicate by facsimile to the othe= r=20 the claimed existence of Gross Error within [3] hours of the Transaction=20 occurring.=20 What do you think? Dave 
The problem with using something other than a quantitative measure (like percentage) is that we quickly get into something to argue about with the customer. Some alternatives off the top of my head to get the ball rolling: - Gross Error determined by independent arbitrator or possibly an appointed third party (auditor?) - Transaction which differs by more than x% from verified other transactions between independent companies during the same period (not just quotations). - Transaction which does not lie within the boundaries of other transactions between independent companies which occurred on that day. - Transaction which does not lie within the bid-offer hi and lo range identified by industry price reports published for that day. (obvious limitations here) Dave Louise Kitchen@ECT 08/22/2000 02:35 PM 
Is there not something better than a percentage?  Noticce the lack of a better answer from me. Andy Zipper@ENRON 22/08/2000 11:44 
I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is commercially reasonable. 
Further to Louise's suggestion: On selecting ""Create Price Limit Order"" from the submission window, a link should appear titled ""How Price Limit Orders Work"". Suggest a location immediately below the bar containing the ""Create Submission"" and ""Create Price Limit Order"" buttons. When this link is pressed, a popup window should appear containing the following text: Price Limit Orders allow you to place an offer to buy or sell at a price which is not currently available. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume available. This submission will remain active until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the hours and minutes you specify in your submission, (ii) Your cancellation (by highlighting the submision and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. Price limit orders are processed automatically by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit order, while your price limit order does not complete. 
DAve - this won't work its too long - you need a phrase -""How this works) which is a hyper text link to the majority of this wording CAn you please sort out. Teresa Smith@ENRON 23/08/2000 18:56 
How do you want us to handle the price limit order submission text?  See Mark's e-mail below.  I believe in the meeting this afternoon we talked about reducing the amount of text in the submission screen and creating a link to a separate section for the remainder of the information. -Teresa

Hi Guys As you are aware some of the metals counterparties we have heard from conduct two types of business: - proprietary trading for own book - brokerage for customers It has been decided to give such metals brokers only, access to metals products on EnronOnline for trading purposes. Can you please let me know whether you have any specific reasons why we should not go ahead with this course of action. Be aware that some of these brokers will be clearing their business through LCH.  This would entail tagging deals with such counterparties in the back office systems and relabelling the cpy as LCH. Look forward to hearing from you. Regards Amita

It has come to my attention that when we have a Financial Master Agreement in place, we have identified that a Master exists for the Weather Products. This is not correct as the ISDA Masters do not properly cover weather. For Weather transactions, we need to use either the GTC or a weather-specific Master Agreement. Frank: Could you please arrange to identify which companies have already transacted on weather and have done so ostensibly under an ISDA?  Could you please also coordinate with Mark as necessary to update Customer Profiles so that customers with ISDA's will need to accept GTC's? If we have customers who have ostensibly transacted already under their ISDA's, let's identify who they are and then decide on a course of action for their profiles. Thanks, Dave 
I'm not too worried about this - the letter which Mark Taylor is preparing will state that whatever method we choose to use will supercede EOL - so if everything is set to GTC and the GTC flags are set to ""read"", that should be enough - unless someone is worried about the confirms. Dave 
Karen Lambert has indicated that we have Master Agreements between HPLC and ENA (physical) and between ENA and ECC (physical &financial).   We will need to populate the master agreements in EOL.  I need some direction relative to this to assure we sent it up correctly.  In addition, we will assign the short agreement you discussed a global id and populate this number in EOL for all desk to desk trades that are intra company. 
Dale, The following language can be added to locations which may attract LDC=20 imbalance charges. Can you identify those locations and add the language? Thanks, Dave 
Here is the language that we discussed: Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, Enron shall not be=20 responsible for any fees, penalties, cash or charges (in cash or in kind)= =20 assessed to Counterparty by a local distribution company for failure to=20 satisfy the local distribution company=01,s balance and or nomination=20 requirements. Stacy 
Pete, Please have a look at the attached to see if it complies with the commercial standards you use today. The ND is the only product of importance for tonight - the remainder we can discuss tomorrow, if you prefer. Thanks, Dave 
Just to confirm recent conversations: 1) At the current time, customers must accept the GTC for each new Product Type grouping (e.g. Belgian Gas Physical forward and Belgian Gas Physical Forward Option would each require acceptance of the same GTC). 2) We would like to keep the ""deal roadblocks"" to a minimum - e.g. we do not want to push customers into reviewing and accepting contracts more often than necessary. 3) We should change EOL so that when a GTC is accepted, all Product Types which reference that GTC will show that the GTC has been already accepted. If anyone disagrees with the above, please let me know ASAP, otherwise I will discuss making the change with Jay. Thanks, 
The Newsticker information will appear in both the House and Garden at the current time - we are unable to distinguish between the two at this time. Therefore, it would be available to all companies accessing our website, whether they are registered users or not. Dave Justin Boyd 05/11/99 10:15 
Dave, It is important to ensure that, to the best of our knowledge, Newsticker Information is accurately stated, current and consistent with other information on the website and in the GTCs, Long Descriptions, User Guide, etc. Nonetheless, we will want to be able to rely on the Legal & Privacy Statement, since this contains an exclusion of liability for the timeliness and accuracy of information on the website (para 4) and an exclusion of any warranties as to the completeness and accuracy of information (para 3). A couple of questions: Will Newsticker Information only be relevant and available to companies that are actually trading on-line? Where on the website will the ""link"" to Newsticker Information appear? {This is important for the purposes of the Legal & Privacy Statement} Regards Justin David Forster 04/11/99 23:40 
Mark/Justin, Obviously, we will need to have an appropriate examination of each data element, but do either of you foresee any complications with us providing information as per the attached via EnronOnline? I am wondering particularly about any liability we may have in the event that the information which we provide is late or wrong. Comments? Thanks, Dave 
Attached is a European spreadsheet which shows possible information items which we could carry on our news ticker. (industry-specific stuff like linepack). It breaks down the items by product grouping. If we want to proceed with putting this kind of info. on the ticker, we would have to acquire legal approval and buy-in from the people who would be responsible for updating the information. What do you think? Should we proceed with putting this kind of stuff on the site? Note that at the current time, it would have to appear in Garden. Dave 
Dave - give me a call at your convenience to discuss. (Note: the master file is in : T:/readwrite/web pricing / website content/ newsticker / Europe - ticker layout.xls) Thanks, P 
Mark, Can you update me as to the status on revising their ETA? Thanks, 
The aforementioned letter: 
Bob, The attached letter format should be used for all of the companies which have not transacted online yet and for whom we wish the GTC to supercede an existing master agreement. It has been approved by Mark Taylor. This can be used for all such companies going forward. Thanks, 
Dale, The statement which Mark Taylor has/is referencing in his email to you is the following: The Floating Price shall be the average of the index for each day in the relevant Determination Period. This should be used for all U.S. and Canadian financial products except weather. Please see me if you have any questions. Thanks, 
Tana, Can you coordinate with David on the procedures? Thanks, Dave 
David, Thanks for the new GTC. We'll get things rolling at our end for the upload of new GTC and customer profiles. I think the ABN number might be better suited to the Registration form . . . Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/30/2000 10:32 PM 
Attached is the revised GTCs that address taxation issues for non-Australian resident counterparties. These GTCs have received tax clearance and hence all approvals have now been given to allow them to be loaded. Enclosed also are the procedures that need to be followed when new counterparties are being considered. To date we have been vetting potential counteparties in the Sydney office. I suggest that the procedures be made available to anyone else who may be given this responsibility. One new matter has come to light. In July 2000 with the introduction of GST in Australia new legislative arrangements will come into place. They will require businesses to have an ""ABN"". It has been suggested that we amend the password application to request the counterparty's ABN. 
Justin, I am assuming that there is no reason from a legal perspective to restrict access to EnronOnline EnBank Auctions - so we will proceed with setting up the user profiles this way (I've already checked with credit). Please let me know if this is assumption is incorrect and we need to restrict access. Thanks, 
Mark, Can you commence the process for ETA's and PA's for Bermuda? Please advise as to how long you think this may take - and if the cost to us is likely to exceed $US 22,000 Thanks, Dave 
Dave, we'll pay the 15,000 pounds for the research on Bermuda law so that Bermuda companies like Commercial Risk can transact on Enron OnLine. 
Noticed you were not copied . . . Dave 
Let me add a couple of observations to Alan's explanation. There will be different GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products. However as it is planned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance Pty.Ltd. as the Enron contracting party and have designate New South Wales (an Australian State) as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical. The only differences currently relate to different data sources. There may also be additional changes that come out of the B&M review to accommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the incorporated in Japan. Hence we would want to take all possible steps to ensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the possibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation. Furthermore although any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a counterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a transaction would be relevant. However, there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for conformity with Japanese law. Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated company may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude derivatives or US power. Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs the appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular Japanese counterparty to trade particular products. This is the process that is currently followed. Accordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded. The Japanese weather GTCs are awaiting B&M signoff. 
Further to my voice mail. . . Dave 
This should be the final version now ! F.Y.I. Edmund changed the contract description. LME + COMEX are fine with Enron using their names + prices. Rgds Diana 
I don't know if we have spoken to Comex, but Edmund says ""We have completed 
Credit are pushing to launch online credit trading for this coming Monday. Have you both ""signed off"" on the process, or are there issues outstanding which need to be resolved, from your point of view? 
Mark, Just a heads - up that Molly Sample from EOTT may be contacting you regarding the possibility of putting an EOTT product onto EnronOnline through a sleeving company. Savita Putigai is running with this from the EnronOnline commercial perspective. 
Mark and I are both unable to attend at that time. Can we reschedule for either 11:00 or after 3:30 Houston time? I assume also that Andrea will attend. I would very much like her input, as I understand she is the one who raised the enforceability issue. Dave Patrick Hansen 07/31/2000 09:02 AM 
Mark and Dave, Last week, we met with a local ""Certifying Company"" called GIRE. Their service is based on the ""Asymmetric Password Method"" . We believe that using their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative. Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please confirm. Regards Patrick 
Mark, Do you have an update as to where we are on due diligence and document preparation for the following: Country Resp.  Start  ETA Chile  Mark T. 06/15/00 Peru  Mark T. 06/15/00 Argentina Mark T. April Brazil Mark T. April Korea  Mark T. 06/15/00 Thanks, 
Mark, Can you forward a copy of the suggested language change to the ETA we discussed a couple of weeks ago with John Lavorato? Thanks, Dave 
Where are we on hte Stack Manager changes - let's definitely get some language agreed David Forster@ENRON 02/08/2000 18:26 
Do you want me to proceed with implementing the ETA language change as discussed a couple of weeks ago? Dave 
Mark, I don't get all warm and fuzzy about point #1 - what do you think? Dave 
Dear All, Attached is a draft proposed comfort letter dealing with the issues that Yorkshire Electricity has with respect to the ETA.  I have forwarded this to their lawyers' for comments. Please note that the letter does not amend the ETA, and is in no way inconsistent with the current legal structure of EOL. I have told Yorkshire's lawyer that this document is subject to internal commercial sign-off, so if you do have any comments please feel free to forward them to me. Thanks, Edmund. 
Yes - Thanks. Dave 
Mark, Could you please update me as to where we are on the following? I need to coordinate with the business units and the addition of customers in these countries. Thanks, Dave Country Resp.  Start  ETA Chile  Mark T. 06/15/00 Peru  Mark T. 06/15/00 Argentina Mark T. April Brazil Mark T. April Korea  Mark T. 06/15/00 P.S. We might want to discuss Argentina and Brazil. Dave 
All, We are intending to launch the EnronOnline Auctions site tonight (Houston time). The site is in near-final form and can be seen at testweb1.eoltest.com. You will need a User ID for the test database to see this site. A comprehensive last look by all would be appreciated - please login to the site and let me know if you have any issues. Obviously, due to the extremely tight timeframe, I will need feedback today. Text should be as approved by each of you (bits and pieces each), although I did make some amendments to some of the instructional text early this morning. Thanks, 
Amita: Could you please have someone provide a transaction User ID in Test to Justin and Edmund ASAP? Tara: The same for Mark Taylor All ID's should be for the TEST database. Thanks, 
All, I am aware that early in the EnronOnline process, some GTC's were only generated for the ""With Collateral"" category and hence, all companies transacting in that commodity were subject to the collateral clause. I am now starting to wonder if this was an oversight, or if there is a reason why all counterparties should be bound by a collateral clause for the following GTC's/Products: I would appreciate any insight which any of you can offer. Thanks, 
I think we need for this to be reciprocal -although I agree the errors are= =20 likely to be only our own. Therefore, I suggest the following: (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, any master agreement o= r=20 any GTC to the contrary, any Transaction resulting from a Gross Error may  = be=20 voided and the parties agree that any such voided Transaction shall be of n= o=20 force or effect.  =01&Gross Error=018 shall mean the posting of any price t= hat is=20 [5]% or more above or below then prevailing market prices, which difference= =20 is verified by the average of quotations from three or more participants in= =20 the relevant market for Transactions which would be conducted at the time o= f=20 the Transaction containing the Gross Error. For a Transaction to qualify as= =20 subject to Gross Error, one party must communicate by facsimile to the othe= r=20 the claimed existence of Gross Error within [3] hours of the Transaction=20 occurring.=20 What do you think? Dave 
The problem with using something other than a quantitative measure (like percentage) is that we quickly get into something to argue about with the customer. Some alternatives off the top of my head to get the ball rolling: - Gross Error determined by independent arbitrator or possibly an appointed third party (auditor?) - Transaction which differs by more than x% from verified other transactions between independent companies during the same period (not just quotations). - Transaction which does not lie within the boundaries of other transactions between independent companies which occurred on that day. - Transaction which does not lie within the bid-offer hi and lo range identified by industry price reports published for that day. (obvious limitations here) Dave Louise Kitchen@ECT 08/22/2000 02:35 PM 
Is there not something better than a percentage?  Noticce the lack of a better answer from me. Andy Zipper@ENRON 22/08/2000 11:44 
I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is commercially reasonable. 
Further to Louise's suggestion: On selecting ""Create Price Limit Order"" from the submission window, a link should appear titled ""How Price Limit Orders Work"". Suggest a location immediately below the bar containing the ""Create Submission"" and ""Create Price Limit Order"" buttons. When this link is pressed, a popup window should appear containing the following text: Price Limit Orders allow you to place an offer to buy or sell at a price which is not currently available. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume available. This submission will remain active until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the hours and minutes you specify in your submission, (ii) Your cancellation (by highlighting the submision and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. Price limit orders are processed automatically by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit order, while your price limit order does not complete. 
DAve - this won't work its too long - you need a phrase -""How this works) which is a hyper text link to the majority of this wording CAn you please sort out. Teresa Smith@ENRON 23/08/2000 18:56 
How do you want us to handle the price limit order submission text?  See Mark's e-mail below.  I believe in the meeting this afternoon we talked about reducing the amount of text in the submission screen and creating a link to a separate section for the remainder of the information. -Teresa 
Bryan, I have just received a copy of a press release draft for credit derivatives which indicates a launch date of February 23rd. As discussed at our previous meeting, we require 2 weeks from receipt of all necessary international due diligence and approvals to complete the update of the user profiles which will be affected by credit derivatives. As we have not yet received these approvals, the date of February 23rd is not possible to achieve for inclusion of credit derivatives on EnronOnline. Also, as previously discussed, EnronOnline is a registered trademark and we need to approve any references which go to customers. I presume that the website includes such references, but I have not yet seen it. Can you forward the internal address and/or confirm that the website is now in its final form? It is critical that all international due diligence be completed prior to any new product being introduced on EnronOnline. Mistakes are far too visible - we need to see documentation to show that everything is in place before any new products are added and before we start making changes which affect our customers. As agreed, we will ensure that EnronOnline is ready for credit derivatives within two weeks of receiving all the necessary information and approvals. Please forward this information as soon as possible. Thanks, Dave 
Mark, Could you call Leonardo or myself to update us on any changes in the review of the appropriate countries? Thanks, Dave 
Attached please find the ""New Products & Markets Status Report"" for August 24th. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! Leonardo Pacheco 
All, I have looked over the U.S. credit GTC and the long descriptions. I see we have decided to go with quarterly billing, rather than monthly. Will the payment/collections cycle cause any heartburn for the back office? I didn't spot any problems with the long descriptions. A few relatively minor comments on the GTC's - which you may or may not want to consider: - Clause 2.(e) (i) (1) - Does this clause preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions? Could we append: ""with regard to the Transaction""? - What happens if a Rep or Warranty is broken? Does that constitute sufficient breach to terminate the contract? I'm thinking specifically about sleeving, which is perhaps covered by Clause 2(e)(ii)(1)? I still think that sleeving is one of the most significant commercial risks faced by online trading of derivatives. If I were working for a third party, I'd immediately look for ways to set up a sleeving service to sell credit protection to the Reference Entities where the Reference Entity or its affiliate views its own risk differently from Enron. If I were the Reference Entity in question, I'd consider: a) Buying a load of protection via sleeving and then declaring bankruptcy - then do a Phoenix (in the UK at least) b) Buy a load of protection via sleeving, then take the Credit Derivatives to another third party financial institution and using the credit derivatives as collateral to increase my line of credit - I'm no expert, but I suspect there might be an interesting leverage effect here, which might actually cause a significant increase in Enron's risk exposure. c) Like (b), only the financial institution could buy the credit derivative with or without the need for sleeving - we probably need a restriction on this? (I know financial institutions are not our preferred counterparts up front, but if I were a financial insitution, I'd quickly find a way around this limitation - Affiliates or Sleevers. -  Do you think it would beneficial to strengthen our protection against sleeving by adding something to Clause 2, like: ""It is not entering into a Transaction for the purpose of concluding a similar transaction with the party (or any Affiliate of such party) which is the Reference Entity in the Transaction"". - Should Def'n of ""Contract Currency"" be ""Contractual Currency""? (""Contractual"" is also used in the Long Descriptions) - Def'n of ""Credit Product"" - after ""Entity"", should we insert ""which is""? - Are we being a bit too nasty by defining the Determination Agent as ""Enron""? As the reference to Determination Agent in the contract is in a context similar to that of an arbitrator, it seems a bit cheeky to then define ourselves as the arbitrator - would this be enforceable if we were in court? I'm assuming the other GTC's are very similar to the U.S. one and I have not read them. Dave 
Fyi 
Hi Guys As you are aware some of the metals counterparties we have heard from conduct two types of business: - proprietary trading for own book - brokerage for customers It has been decided to give such metals brokers only, access to metals products on EnronOnline for trading purposes. Can you please let me know whether you have any specific reasons why we should not go ahead with this course of action. Be aware that some of these brokers will be clearing their business through LCH.  This would entail tagging deals with such counterparties in the back office systems and relabelling the cpy as LCH. Look forward to hearing from you. Regards Amita 
EnronOnline Auctions are now live in the Production database, with EnBank virtual storage as the first product offering. There is a new Auctions button on the bottom of the Quotes screen (replaces the old Market Info. button). Please look over the site contents and let me know if you spot anything which needs to be edited. For detailed EnBank questions, please refer customers to the EnBank HelpDesk at 011 44 (0) 207 783 7700. All media calls concerning EnBank should be directed to Jonathan Whitehead: 011 44 (0) 207 783 6534. Media calls concerning EnronOnline Auctions within Enron's broader EnronOnline/e-commerce strategy will be handled by myself: 001 713 853 1861. Many thanks to those who have put in long hours to bring EnBank and the new auctions site to fruition in record time. 
It has come to my attention that when we have a Financial Master Agreement in place, we have identified that a Master exists for the Weather Products. This is not correct as the ISDA Masters do not properly cover weather. For Weather transactions, we need to use either the GTC or a weather-specific Master Agreement. Frank: Could you please arrange to identify which companies have already transacted on weather and have done so ostensibly under an ISDA?  Could you please also coordinate with Mark as necessary to update Customer Profiles so that customers with ISDA's will need to accept GTC's? If we have customers who have ostensibly transacted already under their ISDA's, let's identify who they are and then decide on a course of action for their profiles. Thanks, Dave 
Mark, Hope you had a good trip back. Please let me know if you need a hand finding the Fred Lagrasta newsletter on EnronOnline and/or if you are concerned by its contents. Thanks, 
Mark, I would appreciate your comments on the following FAQ's, intended to be a guide for Louise/myself/PR in the event we take a media call regarding the injunction/lawsuit. Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please let me know. Any calls received from the media will be answered by Louise, or in Louise' absence, by myself, with PR in the room (Louise will be back in the office on Monday and I suspect it is very unlikely that we would receive any calls before then). Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline? A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff. Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop? A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements which Agency was involved in developing. Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop? A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements which Enron developed. Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency? A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without authorisation from Enron. Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit? A We are not releasing that information at this time. Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged the competitive lead of EnronOnline? A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined. Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies? A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very capable IT consultancy companies. Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided? A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual contributors. Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other companies looking to build something like EnronOnline? A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com. Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information into a public forum. A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our contractor does not seem to have been upheld. Q11 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction? A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information. Q12  If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you also filing a lawsuit? A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate. 
Mark, I was looking through our list of PA's and was struck with the following questions: - Why did we decide to use ENA, Enron Power Operations and Enron Australia Pty as the three Enron companies which appear on the PA's? Political? - Why do the EPOL and EAP PA's say ""for itself and on behalf of its group undertakings from time to time"" (shouldn't the ENA ones say that as well?) - Is there any reason why we shouldn't update all of the PA's for EnronOnline LLC as the Enron company? - Should the EnronOnline PA (For U.S.) also say ""for itself and on behalf of its group undertakings from time to time""? 
Mark, There are some changes to this which are coming, but this is pretty much what we are looking to build. See you at 10:00. Dave 
For your review. 
Just wanted to let you know that Australia is aiming for a March 20 launch. 1) Mark T/Debbie: Can you both confirm that you have reviewed and approved the Australian customer list? (Debbie - I think you may have reviewed the list, but I'm not sure if Mark has seen a copy yet) 2) Mark T: Final long descriptions should be available very shortly (next day or two?) Can you update me on what you have/have not seen and if you are happy with what has been covered so far? I believe you have been in contact with David Minns, so I am hopnig everything is in order. 3) Frank: Please coordinate with Debbie to ensure that we have input from all required depts. with regard to the customer list. Thanks, 
Mark, Can you please start putting together documentation for the following? - Pipeline Capacity Trading ETA (to appear on the new capacity trading website) - Pipeline Capacity Trading Service Contract (entered into on paper with piplelines wishing to post their capacity on EnronOnline I imagine the ETA will be modeled pretty closely on the existing ETA. For the Service Contract, I assume we will be covering things like: - Nature of the Service (what we will do and what they will do) - They will -Post products on EnronOnline - Take responsibility for their prices - Be bound by any transactions which result, subject to their Tariff schedules. - Pay for any hardware needed at their end and/or any 3rd party connection costs (e.g. internet service providers) - We will - Provide the software - Host and maintain the database - Facilitate access to the application - Administer User ID's - Provide support for Product creation - Representation, warranties and limitations of our liability for the service - Confidentiality I assume we may need to sit down and discuss in more detail. I will forward the latest copy of our functional spec.  Please call and let me know what I can do to help in putting the above together. Thanks, 
Stephanie, Attached please find the latest version of the Capacity Specs. Please note that we have added a new application (see number 7). Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! Leonardo Pacheco ext. 39938 
It is obviously a very high priority to ensure that BEA do not make the Agency presentation covering EnronOnline available on their website. Kevin/Jay: Can you please try to identify the appropriate BEA contact as a matter of priority this morning? Richard/Mark: Please advise as to how strong we can be in warning BEA not to publish the information on their website. Thanks, Dave 
We are planning on having credit trading ready for EnronOnline launch on March 8. I believe the legal due diligence and credit due diligence is now complete. The initial list of 50 customers have been approved for credit trading. Of the 20 reference entities, only the following have been approved: Reference Entity    Approval Status Birka Energi AB     Approved Graningeverkens A/B    Approved London Electricity    Approved Scottish and Southern Energy plc  Approved Seeboard plc     Approved Sydkraft AB     Approved Cinergy Corp     Approved The following have not been approved: BC Group plc Hyder plc National Power plc PowerGen UK Scottish Power UK plc Duke Energy Corp Dynegy Inc. El Paso Energy Corp Pacific Gas & Electric Company The Southern Company Inc Lucent Technologies Nortel Networks Corp Reliant Energy Inc Dave Paul Simons 02/24/2000 06:14 PM 
In Bryan's absence, please work together where necessary to let Mark Taylor, Ed and me know/have the following as soon as possible so we can finalise our legal due diligence before launch of online credit trading: best estimate of the launch date for credit trading the final list of counterparties the final list of reference credits Thanks Paul 
Contracts on Platts Benchmarks 
Mark, If Platts is licensing their information for use in the eNymex platform, do= es=20 that change the legal picture with regard to EnronOnline's use of Platts (o= r=20 any other) indices for settling our transactions? Do we have any exposure here? Dave 
I have asked that Hong Kong be removed from the list of online PA's, effective for tonight. This does not prohibit us from distributing PA's directly, if it is decided that direct distribution is OK. However, I am keen to answer the following questions as soon as possible, so we can establish whether or not the PA can be put back on: 1) Does listing a PA for Hong Kong constitute ""targetting"" Hong Kong residents? 3) Does the Protection of Investors Ordinance apply to EnronOnline or the products contained on EnronOnline? 2) What are the HK Securities regulations and what is requried for compliance? Is this painful, or do we qualify with little effort? 4) What happens if we come to the attention of the HK regulator? Does it just mean some ""getting to know you"" meetings, or something more serious? 5) Is the Protection of Investors Ordinance aimed at individuals, or is it intended to cover companies as well? Dave 
Mark, 
David, Thanks for your email. I noted a few points which I hope may be helpful: - re: your comment: ""Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties"" - Please note that we are able to carry up to two versions of the GTC Online - One with the collateral clause and one without - and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept. based on creditworthiness of the customer. Of course, this does not impact our ability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend the terms of the GTC for specific customers - we just can't carry copies of this amendment electronically on EnronOnline. - Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name? - I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities and internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in Australia. - Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the ""Exempt Futures Market Declaration""? Does this apply to ourselves as well as our customers? Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian customers and/or any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade Australian power (if any)? - Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states ""EnronOnline prices are firm"". I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law regarding the legal definition of ""Invitation to Treat"", ""Offer"" and ""Acceptance""? Please note also the related information on the ""Click for Details"" link on the homepage. - The comments in the Mallesons document regarding 3. ""Enron Responds to the Offer"" are not strictly correct. The customer is essentially only able to select a volume equal to or less than that shown on EnronOnline and can only submit a price which is shown on EnronOnline (please call me for a more detailed discussion of the price range function if needed). Enron can only reject such Offers if the customers' credit limit is insufficient, or if the price or volume is no longer on the system at the instant in which the customers' offer hits our database. The acceptance/rejection of a customer's offer at our database is entirely automatic and nearly instantaneous. - 5. ""Confirmation Exchanged"" - although we currently issue faxed confirmations, please note that under EnronOnline, we are not under obligation to do so - the electronic confirmation is deemed sufficient. - Does the first PA amendment read correctly? (also the first ETA amendment) - GTC amendment: Do we need to reference ""ISDA""? Is it not possible at some time now or in the future, to have a non-ISDA master? Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/25/2000 08:26 AM 
Attached is a draft advice from Mallesons on EnronOnline. Of immediate concern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next week. Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments. These are in the annexes to the advice. Following are my comments Password Agreement  - Fine, seems a good to give address for notices etc. ETA - I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under Australian law. The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US. The suggested amendment to clause 3(c) I believe we could dispense with. It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server. However, from what I have been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality. GTCs - Minor changes. The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to the  collateral clause. Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterparties As a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the ETA for inclusion in Road Show. I expect to settle the advice early week  and will circulate it. 
Mark, Paul would like to start his roadshow with Australian customers next Tuesday (Monday afternoon, our time). Could you please review the amendments which David Minns has recommended for the PA and  ETA today, so that Paul can take a copy of at least the PA with him when he visits the customers? Thanks, 
Mark, Here is a draft of an outline for the equity offering for Capacity Trading. Please call when you have a few minutes to discuss documentation and legal issues. Thanks, Dave 
I knew there was a reason we decided to go with ""Lookalikes""! Dave 
Mark, With the addition of the ATA and EnronOnline auctions, we will need to provide the customers a way to identify to us that they wish only to transact on the Auctions. I am thinking the easiest way to do this is with a check box on the PA which says ""(Optional): This application is for EnronOnline 
Mark Taylor has confirmed that the approval processes are separate for legal. Dave 
It is my understanding that the EnronOnline approval process is separate and approval for EnronCredit.com does not automatically mean approval for EnronOnline. Debbie/Mark: Can you confirm or refute my understanding? Thanks, Dave Bryan Seyfried 02/28/2000 12:26 PM 
Attached is the current list of reference credits which are posted on EnronCredit.com.  It is our understanding that we can quote any of these via EnronOnline subject to approval from the EOL team.  Pls. confirm this understanding to all of us but especially mssrs. dilworth and forster 
Mark, We have customers who are now filling out the new form of the Australian PA. As a result, we will need an Online Australian ETA very shortly.

Mark/Justin, Attached is a copy of the Australian PA. It includes the addition of an Address for Service. Do you think we should incorporate this in our other PA's as well? I realise that in many instances we are already doing business with the relevant company - and the same or similar information might be included on the Registration form (where completed) - but are you concerned about ambiguity in the event that no Registration form is completed? Also: We will need to have some way to distinguish PA's which arrive for customers who want access to Auctions only. What do you think about adding a statement like: ""(Optional): Tick this box if you wish to have access only to EnronOnline auctions and not to the main transactions site""  [tick box].

Mark, The ETA does contain some redlines (Tools/Highlight Changes). Not sure if these reflect changes from NA or not - perhaps David Minns can shed some light? Dave Mark Taylor 03/02/2000 01:07 AM

Mark, We have customers who are now filling out the new form of the Australian PA. As a result, we will need an Online Australian ETA very shortly. Can you please approve/disapprove of the ETA form forwarded by David Minns? (copy attached). Once we have your approval, we will put it on the system. Thanks, Dave 
Can youn craft a generic document to handle both cases? Dave Mark Taylor 03/02/2000 01:09 AM 
I had assumed we were going to have a separate PA for the Auction-only counterparties.  The PA contains an unfortunate reference to the ETA which will need to change if they will only be accepting the Auction-only agreement. David Forster 02/29/2000 10:00 AM

Mark, We were trying to keep the PA to a single page due to concerns about the amount of legalise which would need to be read - we didn't want the form to be a deterrant. In this case, the addition is just some blank lines to insert address for service (plus a few words in the body of the PA) - so I'm not as concerned about the impact on length. If we do not know the company, then a completed Registration Form is required - if we do know the company, then the Registration Form is not required. It could be argued that if we know the company, then we should already know the address for service - but I assume this might lead to errors if the address for service desired by the customer for  EnronOnline GTC's is any different from what we have on file? - I assume this was the reason David Minns forwarded this change. I'm happy (and perhaps prefer) to have the address for service included only on Australian PA's, if neither of you see a need elsewhere - although if you don't think its necessary elsewhere, then perhaps it is also not necessary in Australia, in which case we could simplify the form? Please note Australia is already distributing forms with their marketing packs, so if we are going to change the form, sooner is better. Comments appreciated . . . Dave Mark Taylor 03/02/2000 01:13 AM 
May I also point out that we went to great pains to keep the PA to a single page.  This one looks like it runs over to the second page - at least as laid out here.  I was also under the impression that a completed registration form was required before a user ID and password could be issued.  While I don't object to having an address for notices on the PA, I don't think it is necessary in North America if we have a completed registration form. David Forster 02/29/2000 10:01 AM

As mentioned in email to Mark. Please pass along any  concerns you may have on this to me before I respond to Justin and Edmund (hopefully later today). Thanks, Dave 
Hi Dave, Hope all is well! I've attached a comfort letter that we propose to send to Eastern.  Please feel free to make any comments you see fit.  If you have any queries on it please feel free to contact Justin or myself. Thanks, Edmund. 
Mark? 
Dave: I've read the comfort letter.  With respect to item #1, the first paragraph is fine.  With respect to the second paragraph, what situation is he trying to address?  For example, I thought that in situations where the counterparty clicked on a price and the price changed in the counterparty's favor before the trade was executed, that the counterparty would get the better price. The second paragraph might negate this as written.  Can a situation really arise where the system misreads a counterparty's offer?  I think that we need to be very careful in what we say here. With respect to point #2, I need to defer to Mark Taylor on this because I thought that the confirmations control, but it could be the case that our electronic records could prevail if there is a conflict between the 2.  That would seem to make sense to me but I would prefer that Mark concurred with this. Carol 
Mark, It appears there was a mixup in contracts admin. Copies of the licenses should be forthcoming shortly. What is the ETA for the legal analysis of the impact of becoming regulated - i.e. at what point are we subject to regulations, and what is the impact? 
Bryan, I believe Mark Taylor is out of the office until Wednesday. At this point, I believe there are 6 approved Reference Entities for EnronOnline. We will add more up to the previously discussed 20 as approvals are received. Dave Bryan Seyfried 03/05/2000 04:43 PM 
After reviewing all of the lists, attached is the list of reference credits that I forwarded to Mark to load on Enorn Online. Call me if you have any concerns. 
Mark, Further to our discussion as to which licenses might have impact on 3rd party stack: Tibco (which you are already looking at) Oracle (is suspected to be a problem) Weblogic Apache (very low cost - prob. not a big concern) SSL does not require a license. I have requested license copies from Carmen Ayala. 
It has come to my attention that there may be a difference between London and Houston in the legal approval process for Reference Entities. I am told that approval of Reference Entities in Europe for EnronCredit.com means approval for EnronOnline also. However, in the U.S., I am of the understanding that a different approval process is applied. Justin/Edmund/Mark:  Could you please coordinate and tell me: 1) Is my understanding correct? 2) Are we all happy to proceed with this understanding, or does something need to change? 
At this point, the following applies: 1) European Customer Profile Due Diligence on existing EnronOnline customers (for determining whether or not the customers may ultimately be granted Execute status or not) has been completed or the UK and Finland, but is outstanding for Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland. 2) North American Customer Profile Due Diligence on existing EnronOnline customers is complete. Canadian customers cannot have any access and there are no insurmountable reasons why a U.S. customer might not have Execute Access. 3) There are 5 approved Reference Entities - Expected to be 25 by tonight or tomorrow. 4) There are 50 Company Profiles with Execute Status. 5) Everything is in place technically to have the Reference Entities and Customer Profiles running for Wednesday morning. If anyone is under an understanding different to the above, please call me. Thanks, 
Bob/Sheri, Attached is the PA which should be sent to customers with the Auction packs. Note it is different from the U.S. PA which is currently on the system. Dale: Please upload this new PA in place of the NA PA on Friday. Thanks, 
Please note in 1: It is not present in the English ETA. Mario: Please check the U.S. ETA to see if there is an arbitration clause there. Thanks, Dave 
Revising the Electronic Auction Transactions Agreement we noticed there is an arbitration clause (6e). 2 issues about that clause were raised: 1. It is not present in the English ATA. Should it be mentioned in both, neither or maintained the way they are? 2. Are there arbitrators with 8 years professional experience in the Internet Auctions Market? Thanks, Mario

Over-the-Counter ... 
Mark, Are we considered to be 2nd or third tier under the new regulations? Can we obtain a summary of what the new regulations say? Dave 
Further to recent correspondence on this subject: ""Killing"" EnronOnline deals has always been against policy, for a number of reasons, including the need to demonstrate to customers that this is a binding way to do deals and also to provide an auditable process to auditors who may be sceptical of an online transaction system - i.e. we need to show that clicking on the screen  results in a deal which results in an invoice every time. In the same way that it is rare to conclude a transaction by telephone with a trader and then attempt to ""back out"", we must ensure it is a rare event on EnronOnline. Deals can only be terminated under special circumstances, which must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the legal department in consultation with Credit and EnronOnline commercial staff and covered with a special contract entered into with the Counterparty. In all other circumstances, ""undoing"" a deal is at the discretion of the trader and is most easily accomplished by an OTC transaction which reverses the volume, price and payment impact, thus addressing most of the concerns raised below. Dave Brent A Price 03/08/2000 09:02 AM 
I find it difficult to believe we would even be considering the use of OTC trades to effectively ""kill"" another deal.  The points Kathryn raise below are good ones.  How often do deals need to be terminated?  Unless that number is substantial (and I would hope it is not), why the opposition to executing a termination agreement with the counterparty and resolving the problem in the cleanest manner? 
Sheri: Last week you provided me with the options for a process that you and Louise were working on for killed deals.  The 2 options for killed deals were 1. the counterparty would call and execute an OTC to back out the deal (the opposite of whatever he transacted on line) and  2. Enron would execute to the counterparty a termination agreement per deal the counterparty wanted to back out.  My concerns for the first option are: 1.  This potentially would not create a true net effect-  timing from the EOL trade and the phone call to execute the OTC could have price differences 2.  The confirmation process is impacted, would have to generate 2 confirms, one for each side of the trade 3.  Logistics would still have to nom and schedule for delivery both deals, may not be even volumes 4.  Settlements will see both invoices, again due to possible price and volume changes, will not be even netting The termination agreement would be the easiest process for the back office teams and would minimize the downstream effects to these processes.  The execution of termination agreements would be the strongest way to minimize our exposure to these deals since we have the Electronic Transaction Agreement in addition to the contract that governs the confirmation with the counterparty in place.   I know that commercial has a preference to option one but I want to make sure that all the issues are thought through with the possible impacts to the operations raised.  I've asked Scott Mills to explore Sitara for possible lock down of EOL deals after validation to ensure that there is tighter control over the deals for further exposure to potential modifications or kills.  Scott has indicated that the lock down of critical fields would be a big system change, but has agreed to review this and determine exactly what the IT estimates would be.  After we look at the Sitara requirements to support this change I will provide additional feedback. KC 
Mark, Can you fill me in on the details here? Thanks, Dave 
Thor, We are trying to globalise the GTC's so that a customer could transact on a particular weather product up to 24 hours per day and do so on similar terms and conditions, even if the product is being passed from one Enron office to another during the day. I have learned today that the legal resource we need to work on this will not be available until the first or second week of January, behind another weather project which is currently consuming their attention. We are trying to identify another resource which may be able to help (we need to coordinate legal response from each of the Enron offices), but so far, no luck. I had hoped we would be able to resolve this sooner, so that you would not have your customers accept a new GTC, and then have to accept it again in short order if we apply changes to the GTC in order to ""globalise"" it. If you want to proceed now with the current GTC, we can certainly do that. If you would prefer to wait for a globalised GTC, we can do that too - it's your call. Please advise how you would like to proceed. Dave Thor Lien@ECT 12/20/2000 01:20 AM 
Can everyone please respond to the GTC for Weather, because we need it ASAP to get our products set up for next year Thanks Thor Lien 
Thor Justin sent the GTCs to Mark Taylor (Houston) and David Minns (Sydney) and he has had no response.  Amita is going to follow up with Dave Forster to find out why we have to wait so long as he was the person who told Amita to get the GTCs globalised in the first place.

Mark, Would appreciate a discussion on this. Thanks, Dave 
with companies on the ETA / PA changes Louise, No changes have been made to ETAs or PAs. In the case of National Power they requested an anodyne clarification of a clause in the ETA (one of the same points TXU required clarification - I had emailed Dave a copy of that letter). We are planning to send them a letter to that effect  (copy attached).  It does not constitute an amendment to the ETA.  As it hasn't yet been sent youself or Dave can veto it. Thanks, Edmund.

It has come to light that there have been a number of  EnronOnline transactions which have been ""undone"" after the fact. These are situations in which an EnronOnline trade has been completed, but we have agreed verbally with the other party that the trade will be deemed not have happened and we may have suppressed generation of a faxed confirmation. It is of great importance that we do not do anything which makes an EnronOnline trade appear as though it is not firm, or not reliable, or which affects the audit process. Therefore, EnronOnline transactions must not be killed. Individual traders might elect to conduct an OTC transaction which has the effect of reversing the impact of an EnronOnline transaction - this activity is outside the scope of EnronOnline. Please note that there has never been an instance in which there has been a system error on EnronOnline which caused a trade to take place which was not initiated by the customer. All instances to date have involved some kind of operator error, or failure to use the results of a Transaction Search to verify completed deals. Dave

Dave, I made a few edits that you can take or leave -- purely stylistic.  I'll work with John on anything further. 
Further to my converation with Mark Taylor, I understand that there are some potentially substantial changes to the Australian GTC in the works. Please advise as to when the redrafted GTC is expected to be available. If necessary, we will come into the office this weekend to upload it. Thanks, 
Further to my conversation this evening with David Minns: The cellphone connection was not good, however, I understand from my conversation with David that in his opinion, the current GTC would not preclude an international company from trading with Enron Australia on Australian Power. David mentioned that there are regulations which govern trading in Australia, which require that companies register with the Australian authorities. I assume, however, that these registration requirements would not apply to the counterparty if the counterparty were not located in Australia? (David, please confirm). David stated he would call Mark to discuss the GTC and (presumably) determine what action may need to be taken (if any) for Monday. I assume that whatever action is agreed, it will result in a situation in which international (non-Australian) companies can transact with Enron Australia on Australian financial power and that such action will be completed prior to Monday's launch. David/Mark: Please leave me a voice mail on 713 853 1861 or send an email as soon as the way forward is identified. Thanks, 
As I understand it, the current situation with regard to international companies being able to transact on Australian power is this: The only remaining potential issue is witholding tax. This may or may not be an issue and is being researched by Heidi Mason. If it is an issue, it is possible that we can borrow some language from the U.S. financial GTC. Heidi will coordinate with David Minns and suggest a solution (if required) for incorporation into the Australian GTC. An issue was raised with regard to ""Eligible Persons"", and the requirement that an ""Eligible Person"" hold more than $AUS 10 million. However, Tana Jones has been in discussion with David Minns on this issue and determined that the U.S. requirements are in fact more stringent than the Australian ones, hence the application of U.S. criteria for Financial trades should be more than sufficient to meet the Australian ""Eligible Persons"" requirements. Furthermore, a perusal of the approvals by credit indicate that no companies with an E-rating of less than 4 have been approved by credit. An issue was also raised with regard to settlements and the use of Austra-Clear. However, as we are unlikely to have large numbers of foreign companies transacting on Australian power in the near term, this should be a problem which can be resolved in the back office if it arises and should not impact the GTC, the planned Monday launch or the customer profiles. At this point, I am anticipating (possibly) having a witholding tax revision to the GTC, which will be uploaded to the system on Friday (Houston time). If anyone has any questions or concerns, please contact me on 713 853 1861 (office) or 713 562 8678 (cell). Thanks, 
Today we will: 1) Upload the GTC today with the revision noted below 2) Update the Australian Customer Profiles in accordance with the completed Credit/Legal/Contracts review. 3) Update the non-Australian Customer Profiles such that non-Australian customers have only read access. When we have clarification or an opinion with regard to: a) The procedure for determining whether or not a non-Australian Counterpart qualifies for Execute Access on Australian Power and; b) Determining whether or not tax clause changes to the GTC really are required; then we will: 4) Update the non-Australian Customer Profiles for Execute Access to Australian Power. Note: It is highly desireable to avoid making changes to GTC's once they are published - and certainly once they have been accepted by a company (i.e. a company which does not already have a signed Master Agreement with Enron), as this requires an awkward change notification process. Therefore, if the GTC/Tax issue can be resolved before Monday, it would be much appreciated. Dave David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/17/2000 11:58 AM 
This will indeed be a St Patrick's Day for us to remember in years to come. Now that I am back in the office from Adelaide let me give some more considered replies. It appears there has been a bit a communication mix-up no doubt not helped by me being out of the office. So l let me go back to the beginning. Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. is authorised to trade Australian power derivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid out by the Government. These require "" that before entering into a contract with a counterparty, the registered facility provider (ie Enron Australia Finance) must be satisfied on reasonable grounds: (a) about the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and 
Dave I have had the following responses on the issues we discussed earlier: I spoke with David Minns re the 'Eligible Persons' criteria, and he noted that while he had discussed the capital/asset holding criteria with Tana, he had not provided to anyone the other criteria, and that while these may be covered by the US criteria, there will need to be a review of all criteria before we can assess that all are covered. I spoke with Chris Catt at Price Waterhouse Coopers and he confirmed that provided there is no interest component in the cross border settlements made, there will be no with-holding tax issues re the payments/receipts. I am going to meet with Chris on Monday to discuss both the taxation implications and to review the GTC. On the settlement issue, in the short term the best way to do the settlements for non-NEMMCO members would be via wires from Houston (this is how we settled our one previous cross border transaction) as this gives a third party review of the payments prior to release.

We actually did consider adding ""short"", but there is nothing on the site which identifies where the ""short description"" is (obvious to us, but not necessarily to the customer), so we decided to proceed without this (I realise the arguments are not very strong either way). It was felt at the time that ""Product Description"" would provide as much direction as ""Product Short Description"", so the language for NA products has been implemented in this way. Dave Edmund Cooper 03/17/2000 01:40 PM 
Fine.  If the dates are always going to be stated in the short description it would make sense to add ""short"" between ""product"" and ""description"", unless this causes a problem. Thanks, Edmund, Awais Omar 03/17/2000 01:27 PM

Awais, I have now made your requested changes in complex descriptions.  As mentioned in email below, I was not sure whether you wanted to remove the supply period information for UK and Cont Gas.  Mark suggested that I speak to Jonathan Whitehead to confirm that this information be left in the complex description.  Jonathan has said that he thinks that it should be there as long as legal have approved it. If the supply period text should be removed, please let me know and I will remove it.  Once this has been confirmed, do you then want me to go ahead and inform the traders that they can now start setting up their products with tokenised periods? Many thanks Anna 
I have made the relevant changes in complex descriptions.  Before I go ahead and inform the traders that they can set up their products for DA, BoM etc, could you take a look at the descriptions for UK Gas and Belgian Gas.  I have inserted the relevant term of transaction info (""The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the website"") but have not taken out the information on Supply periods (The Supply Period shall be for the gas Days commencing on the Saturday and Sunday following the trade date and any Friday and/or Monday, adjoining such Saturday and Sunday, which is not a Banking Day.). Does this info need to be deleted, or should it remain in all complex descriptions for UK and Cont Gas? Let me know and I will amend if necessary.

I n additon could you please also upload the rules for (i) Day Ahead Can Nat Gas (Sumas/Hunt/S2) and (ii) BoM Can Nat GAs (Sumas/Hunt/S2) into Test as well.  I have created two products 4293 and 4294 in test.  So once the rules have been inserted can you please also run the relevant part of the scheduler to convert the abbreviationot date so that Jennifer can then test bridging of these Canadian products. Dale, Arfan Can you please check the comples description for each of the tokenised peirods listed in the spreadsheet above reads: ""The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the

Mark, I agree with David's comments - and furthermore, I would like to find a solution which removed Australia from the day-to-day administration of customer profiles, if the Australian criteria can be applied from a simple ruleset. Adding another timezone to the process is not going to speed things up. Dave 
Mark I am most happy to provide administrative support as required but I would appreciate discussing this request with you. I am unsure as to what is expected. I have formally advised there are no restrictions on ""Australian based"" which I take to mean companies incorporated in Australia entering into foreign transactions. On a more general level I am facing a bit of a challenge with EnronOnline communications out of Houston. Last week I counted requests from 7 different persons in Houston all of who feel empowered to delegate tasks to or request legal advice from me. I find myself answering the same question several times and on occasions working with conflicting instructions.Clearly I recognise the need to provide legal support to Enronline and that last week was a bit extraordinary. But I believe the current arrangements can be substantially improved. Would it be possible to delegate some contact points? My clear preference on matters of an administrative nature would be to work through Paul Smith who is co-ordinating the implementation of EnronOnline. Interested in your thoughts. 
Further to discussions with Tana today: I understand there are some concerns with regard to the amount of time necessary to complete the due diligence process on each new company added to the EnronOnline customer list. Tana has requested that we adopt some rules which would reduce the amount of time spent on this activity. I am much in favour of this, but we need to ensure that the rules do not work such that many customers are prevented from transacting on products which they would otherwise be able to. e.g. Tana has suggested that companies who are not registered in the U.S. should automatically receive a profile which disallows them from trading in U.S. physical power, as they are unlikely to hold the required FERC license (subject of course to review of individual requests from the companies themselves). I am happy with this rule, as it seems highly unlikely that non-U.S. companies would hold a U.S. electricity license. If anyone would like to adopt similar rules for other products, please run them past me before implementation - assuming Mark and Justin are OK with the concept. Thanks, Dave

Mark, Do you have an ETA for the ETA and PA? Thanks, 
Mark, Attached is a copy of the OTC GTC which the Bandwidth group wishes to use for Bandwidth trading on EnronOnline, launching May 1. Could you please let me know which of your guys will be looking after reviewing/amending this for EnronOnline? Thanks, Dave 
David, Here's a first cut of the data to get us started.  Please have a look, and let me know what other blanks we will need to fill in as we go.  I've also looked at the additional considerations, and we should sit down and discuss some of these things with Jean sometime soon. Please review the attached documents, and I'll continue to refine them along the way.  Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for your help, Jay 
Mark, Louise is going to be in Japan on April 10 with Joe Hirl and Rebecca Mark to announce the launch of EnronOnline in Japan. Obviously, this means we need the ETA and PA very soon. Can we have reasonably final drafts by the end of this week? 
Mark, What differences are you expecting between the Master and a GTC? Can we not use the Master as the basis for a GTC? Dave Mark Taylor 03/29/2000 01:16 AM 
I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for bandwidth.  I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last week.  My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC. David Forster 03/27/2000 04:26 PM

Mark, Are you happy with the GTC changes and can we upload the new GTC to the system? Dave 
Thanks for your input. On the issues you raised following are my comments 1. The only change is the new tax clause which is paragraph 2.5 2. I will leave it to out tax experts to confirm the arrangements but I believe the tax treatries are limited to the countries I listed. As far as procedures are concerned I would be looking for signoff from tax. Either Susan Musch or PW. 3. refer 1 above 4.Yes I can make this determination. 5. Clause 2  of the ETA will be of great assistance but we cannot avoid our responsibility entirely, particularly where there are reasonable grounds to assume a party is not trading as a principal As I am in Houston can we get together to discuss.

Password Deletion It has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar to their User ID's for internal EnronOnline applications (Stack Manager, Product Manager, EOL Reports). This is a significant security concern. Therefore, there will be a sweep of ID's and passwords at the end of the day on Thursday, April 5. Any User ID's which have passwords similar to the User ID will be subject to deletion. Changing Your Password Passwords can be changed in either the Stack Manager or in EOL Reports. To change your password in the Stack Manager, once logged on, go to toolbar & select ""Help"" and then select ""Change Password"". The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice. To change your passsword in EOL Reports, open the Reports application, log in, select ""Options"" and ""Change Password"".The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice. Please note that the password change functionality within the Reports application is new. If it does not appear on your menu and you are running on a standalone machine, you will need to logout at the windows level and then login again to receive the updated version.

I am not aware of any services associated with EnronOnline which the Japanese office might provide which could be the subject of such fees. Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/01/2000 06:17 PM 
Mario, Yes, we should be ready to go, although the law firm we are using in Japan (Baker & McKenzie in Tokyo) have indicated that they still have a few open issues to follow-up on. Baker & McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron non-Tokyo trading office receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty, that payment should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax.  Further, they have advised that consumption tax (Japan's 5% VAT) should not apply to financial transactions, although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the 5% consumption tax. Baker & McKenzie have advised that they need to do some follow-up work with respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where our non-Japan trading offices are located.  I expect to have their response shortly. One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other Enron trading offices.  In this case, it may be appropriate for Enron Japan to receive a service fee for such services.  I am in the process of determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.  I will let you know of any additional developments as soon as they occur. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 05/01/2000 02:50 PM 
Susan, Following up on David's email, I understand we are ready to go, right? Mario 
Mario is away until next week. The Japanese could trade with any Enron office which is posting commodities on EnronOnline - but are most likely to be interested primarily in the products posted by Singapore (global products), as it provides the best timezone overlap. Both physical and financial are possible, but none of the physical delivery locations on EnronOnline are currently in Japan. Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/27/2000 12:38 PM 
Mario, Thanks for your e-mail.  I wanted to follow up on one more point just to make sure we have everything covered for May 1st.  Do we expect the Japanese to do online trading with the other Enron trading offices?  If so, which offices would they be trading with and what kind of products would be traded?  For example, would there be physical settlement (or delivery) of product in Japan to the Japanese customers or would there be only financial derivatives traded? I really appreciate your help on this. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/27/2000 10:55 AM 
Susan, Your understanding is correct. Thanks, Mario Parra Cardoso EnronOnline Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/27/2000 10:46 AM 
I have a conference call set up with our Japanese tax counsel this evening (Thursday evening Houston time).  After the call, I should be able to confirm that there are no major Japanese tax issues once our Japan office commences trading with Japanese counterparties through Enron Online. However, I understand that initially, the Japan Online implementation will only entail Japanese counterparties trading internationally (e.g. trading non-Japanese products).  Based on this assumption, I think we're okay for Monday from a Japanese trading office perspective.  Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect. Best regards, Susan Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/26/2000 03:34 PM 
Jeff, The marketing material is on its way to Tokyo. This Friday it is expected to be sent to clients. As you can see, time is something that we don't have. Could you please let us know if we are OK to go with the Japanese launch? Thanks, Mario 
Jeff, You are right. For the launch of EnronOnline in Japan, local clients will be offered the ability to trade existing EOL products. Japanese products will be offered in  the future. Please be advised, though, that Singapore products are likely to be added to EnronOnline before the Japanese launch. We expect Japanese clients to trade Singapore products, in addition to the ones currently available. Thanks, Mario Jeff Blumenthal@ECT 04/19/2000 03:18 PM 
Mario, We have begun discussions with a Tokyo law firm regarding the various Japanese tax issues related to EnronOnLine.  In that vein, can you please clarify whether ENA will be offering certain Japanese counterparties the ability to trade existing EOL products (i.e., products that are not Japanese-based) and that such offering will commence in May, 2000, while no Japanese products will be offered until sometime in the future? If you would, please reply to all listed above so that we can hold discussions this evening with out Japanese tax advisors. Thanks for your help, and best regards, Jeff Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/19/2000 10:12 AM 
Jeff, Japan is obviously the country that worries me the most since we intend to launch the site for Japanese clients in May. The marketing material is expected to be sent by late next week. Please let me know how long the process for Japan may still last and if you anticipate problems. Brazil and Argentina are expected be launched this summer. Thanks, Mario Jeff Blumenthal@ECT 04/19/2000 09:34 AM 
Mario, We've begun working with our outside tax advisors.  I understand the urgency of this matter and will see that it is moved along as quickly as possible. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON 04/17/2000 04:07 PM 
Jeff, Anything new on tax issues related to EnronOnline for the countries above mentioned? Thanks, Mario 
Mark, Looks like interest in Mexico is increasing. Can we please complete the preparation of an ETA/PA? Thanks, 
I agree with Leslie - and we need to be careful about names Affiliates, too. Each Master User ID is intended for use by one legal entity. If the Affiliate is just a trading name and is the same legal entity, then we are OK - but if they are a separate legal entity, then we have problems with: a) The ability of one entity to bind another b) Credit headroom allocations and netting between entities. We should restrict the Master User ID and ETA to be applied to a single legal entity only. Dave Leslie Hansen@ECT 05/08/2000 11:44 AM 
Carol, I am not comfortable with an exclusion of affiliates from Section 2(a).  Instead, I think we need to include an express carve out that provides that the CP cannot utilitize the Website on behalf of third parties except for [Name of Principals] pursuant to [Name of Agency Agreement]. Leslie Carol St Clair 05/05/2000 09:28 AM 
David: GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA: 1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the Website password?] 2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a similar indemnity. I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1? Carol 
Mark, Just ensuring you are in agreement with what I am seeing in Brazil: - Andrea Bertone is legal counsel in Brazil who is working with you on EnronOnline. - Pinherio Neto is outside legal counsel for EnronOnline in Brazil. 
Mark, Attached is an early draft of text for the proposed TransWestern Capacity Auction site. I am sending it to you now only to give you a heads-up that this is in the works and is referred to in the document as a ""Transwestern"" Auction, as opposed to an Enron Auction. Leonardo is the point man on this. 
So, basically we're OK for current plans - although credit should be aware = of=20 A3? Dave Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/11/2000 10:47 AM 
I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their= =20 final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese= =20 trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20 summary of their advice: A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions 1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20 swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment= =20 flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that= =20 Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput= ed=20 interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta= x. 2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a= re=20 generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20 transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20 imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t= he=20 subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such= =20 excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and= =20 delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20 financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices. 3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20 connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20 arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20 Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and= =20 pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20 withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer. B. Physically Settled Transactions 1. Consumption Tax Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an= d=20 on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab= le=20 to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit= e,=20 including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20 paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20 provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20 Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base= d=20 customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20 capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a= nd=20 then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20 If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20 commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20 required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20 consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a= n=20 arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20 resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption= =20 tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer. 2. Excise Tax Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20 commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum= =20 products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon= =20 the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20 coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20 petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t= o=20 excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities= =20 before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a= nd=20 has responsibility for payment of excise taxes. C. Tax Representations The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20 Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in= =20 force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20 entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20 representations may provide that: (1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl= y=20 and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and (2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20 entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article= =20 of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in= =20 the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20 Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati= on=20 or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t= o you.
