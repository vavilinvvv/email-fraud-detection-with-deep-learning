Sally, Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines. Please keep me up informed on this matter. Thanks and good luck with the students. mike Enron North America Corp. 
Charlene, Thanks for the email.  I have talked with Sally several times on this last= =20 couple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedule= =20 then other schools.  Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future a= nd=20 I have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on th= at=20 trip.  I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe that= =20 from an OU perspective it may be a mute point now.  Doing that should be ab= le=20 to maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexi= =20 has done.  By the way, the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very= =20 successful. If you have any other questions or comments please let me know. mike Charlene Jackson@ENRON 10/05/2000 06:34 AM 
Sally, Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and= =20 Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis= h=20 that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin= g=20 difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was= =20 available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any= =20 member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to= =20 explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set = it. You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20 permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As= =20 you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting= =20 firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark= et=20 research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20 required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20 shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10= =20 years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm= s,=20 begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20 actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns= =20 until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,= =20 Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first= =20 year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui= t=20 in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for= =20 ""spring"" internships. The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last= =20 year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &= =20 February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that= =20 did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope= . =20 We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20 because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms. Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s= ummer=20 interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and= =20 40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20 summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20 assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20 offers to join Enron.  =20 The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20 summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20 undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20 particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms= =20 that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20 undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20 continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the= re=20 were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs). With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about= =20 which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y= ou=20 indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve= r,=20 provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken= =20 therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU. While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained= =20 from UT. o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20 o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on= =20 campus conduct interviews in the fall for ""summer"" internships.  Cindy=20 attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring= ,=20 or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct= =20 all interviews  at one time. =20 o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting = on=20 campus recruit in the spring for summer internships. We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t= he=20 statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such= =20 information. =20 It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20 different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20 individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for= =20 the discrepancies. While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20 different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie= ve=20 that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20 supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20 already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview= =20 process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in= =20 most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by= =20 the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would= =20 like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this= =20 fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to= =20 support your efforts. I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20 frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20 manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i= f=20 you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20 Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20 interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.

Jeff has interviewed with Mark Frevert, Ray Bowen and Steve Kean who have given favorable feedback.  At this time, we would like to proceed with an offer.  Please contact us with any concerns or questions by the close of business Thursday.  If we have no opposing votes, we will proceed. Below are a few points and a resume for your review: Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been working at Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. Thank you. Mike and Jeff

Mark, I wanted to let you know that today will be my last day at Enron. Please remove me from all the boards. I have really enjoyed working with you and my time at Enron. I still can't believe all that has happened.  Best of luck to you and your family and I hope we get a chance to work together again someday. Sincerely, Mike

All, Attached, for your information,  is a 2 page financial and statistical fact sheet for EGM (as a consolidated unit and for each business unit).  I obviously would have liked our gross margin and EBIT to be a lot larger but all the other facts show enormous growth and progress.   I wanted to at least get it into your hands in case you needed a quick reference. Thanks, Mike 
Louise, I thought you would want to see this since you were there during all of those times. m 
Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The opinion seeks to conclude ""what rational businessmen could have intended"" rather than applying the provisions of the contract. For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the  ""retrospective consequences"" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective. As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service. Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as ""appalling"" and ""pathetic,"" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been ""stitched up"".  Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse. In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 783 6582.  Many thanks.

Thanks.  Wow, you're quick on email.  Jeff and I will be the only attendees. 
Guys, Attached is a resume for a guy I know via technology and a very old parental friendship.  He is a very aggressive guy and marketer type.  He has the personality to be an originator or mid-marketer.  He would pound the phones. Follow up if you want to talk with him. I am going to forward on to technology guys too but wanted to give you first crack. Mike 
Hello Mike, It has been a while since my last communication with you. I hope all is well. I want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch with Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. However, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most likely going to be sold off in pieces. I have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility of an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion that EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be right for me to consider an origination position with EBS. With that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what opportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an origination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally tough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience in professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial skills. Mike please consider the attached resume below. I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your organization at any time. Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you. Richard Dukes Richard T.

Ken, Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 500 people. We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months. I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact. If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff. Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance. 
I'm in.  We'll get started in a couple of months.  Hopefully no sooner! Thanks, 
I'm in. 
Art, Here is a few numbers. Av. external transactions per day:  4,600 Life to date notional value:  $550 billion (yes billion, we just passed 1/2 a trillion dollars) Daily value of transactions:  $2.6 billion Percentage of business today in N America:  76% Products offered:  1,815 I hope that helps and good luck. 
I don't know her.  Sorry. 
FYI , this is what Suzanne was talking about.  I didn't know any of this was going on.  I haven't talked with SN yet.  Do you have any comments before i do? m

Virginia, Thanks for the emails.  No interest in the above or the miro.  I am actively looking for a Pierre Bonnard lithograph, in color and signed.  Also looking for Lautrec but probably after Bonnard.  I will want to see numerous examples before I choose the Lautrec that we want. If you have any Bonnards,  please let me know and send a copy of the image. 
Louise, You're very welcome.  It is always a pleasure to celebrate this blessed event.  This  is a truly special time in your life and I hope you and Marcus can relax and enjoy it.  This event will change your life and bring you true joy.  I remember the birth of our children like it was yesterday.  Simply writing this makes me feel great and my thoughts and prayers will be with you during this wonderful time. Remember work will always be waiting for you;  this is what is truly important. Sincerely, 
Per, I need a copy of the signature pages for all the signed dashes.  I want them for my files. Thanks, 
Ron, I met with him today and steered him in a couple of directions.  He is a very sharp guy and he should be able to find a commercial home somewhere in the near future.   I'll let you know after he talks about opportunities with various groups around EGM. Thanks, 
Bob, He is now in town (he arrived on Monday).  Please call and leave him a voicemail.  We will meet with you. Mike Bob Nimocks <BNimocks@ZeusDevelopment.com> on 04/25/2001 09:16:30 AM

Thanks!   You really changed the energy business. 
Thanks for the email.  Also, nice job on the phone today with Whalley.  I think you answered all of his questions and concerns and I think you'll like meeting him next week. 
John, FYI, here is the presentation we discussed today.  This is internal only but it can act as a guide if you want to know what we are doing or our approach. This is a first draft and I'll send you an updated one when it is finished. m 
It looks great. 
Mark, Thanks for lunch, I really enjoyed our conversation. Here is the presentation we discussed.  This is an internal presentation only. mike 
CP, Go ahead and put me in the Marriot.  I should give this a try.  Plus it will make them plan better for us. 
Ted, Howdy from Houston.  I didn't see the article but please fax me a copy of the piece if you have one.  Fax# is 713 853 1922. I will make myself available after class to meet with whoever you want me to meet with.  Sorry I cant stay for the meeting, i really wanted to. I will need a student to take me to the airport on Friday morning but don't need one on Thursday. Do you want me to have breakfast or meet with the new dean? Thanks and see you soon. 
FYI, this is an interesting tool for when i am out. m 
I am interested in the online version.  My login id is:  mmccon1 thanks, 
Dorie, thanks, but I need a sweater (M) not a shirt. 
Laura, I would like 2 Champions pavillion tickets for all 4 days.  I am not sure who I will take as of yet. thanks, 
Haven't i already done this.  This went out a while ago didn't it?

Mike,  it is going to take a long time for the frustration to subside from this one.  It would be one thing to lose fair and square.  It was quite another to simply be ""mugged""  (the word used by Jonathan Sumption).  Even worse, Pollack (your old friend) was overheard to say that it was a joke the way Enron got ""stitched up"".  Makes you feel a bit like you are in a kangaroo court.  One read of the opnion will bring tears to your eyes when they talk about ""what the parties really intended"" instead of what the contract says. The only route of appeal is to the Court of Human Rights (which right this minute I am feeling that mine have been violated) so it's a tough one. Anyway onward and upward to the broadband world (nothing's easy these days). Thank you for your words of comfort.  I must confess that in reality I am actually struggling to come to terms with this one (because we are right, of course), but in the end I must remember, this too shall pass.  Ciao. 
Mary Nell, I can't tell you how disturbed I was over this.  I can't imagine how you are feeling.  As I said in the voicemail it certainly is not a reflection on the teams efforts.  It speaks volumes about the UK and our independence! No way to take this to the EU? mike 
How's this for the next stab.  Please review, make changes and send back for a final.  I didn't try to make this just perfect but consoldite a little and add a little. Thanks, Mike 
Have it sent to me and I'll make sure it gets looked at. cheers, 
Shanna, Please make this happen ASAP.  I thought he was done. Also, I would like to see a list of all of our key people and their conctract expiration dates.  I believe you have that but I've not seen a copy. Thanks, 
Doug, The Masters was great and of course you were right, the course was magnificent.  This is my 4th trip down and I'm going to try and not ever miss the tournament (but of course I haven't played it!).  The azaleas were not at max bloom, i think they were about a week away due to the cooler weather.  What a great tournament. Please give me a call next time you are in Houston and I'll set up a game at Champions.  I am looking forward to the tour championship later this year. Give my best to Jennifer and Chris says hello. Chris would like to email Jennifer, would you please send back your home email address via return email?  Ours is mmccontex@aol.com. Mike 
The cat needs something. I had fun on the trip.  Jim is a good guy and I'll send you a copy of the pictures for him when i get them back.

Mike: Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron.  We are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace, especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to discuss our observations and learn more about Enron's desires in this arena. Also, we have a meeting planned in D.C. in late June, entitled ""LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply.""  With the U.S. hunger for gas and El Paso, AEC and other's announcements of new projects, the meeting should be constructive, especially with DOE and FERC involvement.  See summary below. Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace. We've just completed a white paper, entitled ""Atlantic-Basin LNG: A Whirling Supply/Demand Balance.""  You may find our conclusions of interest. Best regards, Bob Nimocks President Zeus Development Corporation www.zeusdevelopment.com 2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250 Houston, TX 77042 Direct: 713-952-9529 Main: 888-GR8-DATA (478-3282) e-mail: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com *********************************** TITLE:  LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply DATE/LOCATION:  Washington D.C., June 27-29 SUMMARY:  The winter of 2000/2001 confirmed the shift in the United States from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage. Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover. The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002; however, more are needed. Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United States and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals. Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production (IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern. The June 27-29 conference, entitled ""LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply,"" will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States. * * *

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The 
Dorie, Thanks for everything on the Masters trip.  I thought it went very well. I enjoyed our shirt and sweater gift but i have a question.  I got a large sweater and need a medium.  Do you have a medium left?  I brought in the large to exchange. Thanks,

Ron, I hope you had a good week.  I've thought a lot about your family and you've been in my prayers. I apologize for the delay in this email but i decided not to bother you with this while you were away.  As a follow-up to our conversation, the authors that have had the biggest influence on me and along the lines we discussed are: Dr. Denis Waitley (The Psychology of Winning, How to Build your child's self-esteem, many others but I can't remember the titles) Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (The Power of Positive Thinking) Og Mandino (The Choice, The mission) Dr. Wayne Dyer (many) Anthony Robbins (Unlimited Power, Personal Power, many others) Attached are a couple of the outlines I did.  To my extremee frustration I can't find some of the others that i did many years ago.  I got a lot out of all of these, usually a little from each and when you least expect it.  I am a great believer in the old saying, ""When the student is ready the teacher will come"". As we discussed, the results of all of the hundreds of books and tapes have had a profound effect on me and my family.  A few direct tangible results include:  my extensive long and short term goal setting, affirmation collection (over 100 pages and growing), my family journal (80 pages and growing) ..... When you get a chance and things settle down, please give me a call or I can definitely find time for lunch. Mike 
Thanks for the update.

CP, i cant open and review.  Please get a copy of the goals. m 
All, Attached is a presentation that I have put together to review EGM's activities.  The purpose is to provide an information package on our businesses for Senior mgt and Investor relations.  This will not be distributed externally but will education people on our businesses and some of our goals. Please take a few minutes to briefly  review and make any comments and/or changes and fax  or provide a hard copy back to me.  You can send me copies of just the pages that have updates.  Also please focus on the map and insure that there are not mistakes ( i found some recently).  There is also a shorter version presentation that is more external and once I've updated both, i will send everyone a copy via email for your reference and use. Thanks, mike

Mike - so you would say he would come in at a manager level?  I appreciate the lead. John 
John, Attached for your review is a resume for Trevor Woods.  He worked for me in 2 areas,  including directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left enron to join his brother in law in a start up out in San Francisco.  He was an associate at the time.  He is interested in coming back and is talking with many areas of enron for positions.  His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment.  If she does, he would really like to come as well - if it is possible.  I didn't know if you have a need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an origination type of role. I wanted you to have shot at him as well. Mike

Mike and Eric, Informally I was told today that the new President of PDVSA Gas will be Nelson Nava, this is very good news for us since he has been a very strong supporter of the project for a long time. We have a solid relationship with Nelson, so I believe he could be a good sponsor for our project. More importantly, we will not have to educate Nelson about the project. Just in case you don't remember, we all met him when we visisted PDVSA-Gas earlier this years. The meeting in PDVSA-Gas was in his office. Once it is official, it would be a very good idea for you Mike to call him to congratulate him. I will let you two know next week. Emilio

All, Attached is a resume for Trevor Woods.  Trevor worked with me at HPL and directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left to do the dot com thing with his brother-in-law who was CEO of this company.  He is interested to come back to Enron and is talking to various people around Enron.  He has offer opportunities at EBS and EES and has been talking with Billy Lemmons about ag.  Trevor is great and would be excellent in a Jr. commercial roll in an origination type of function. He is interested in moving pretty quickly and if you have an interest please contact him in the near future. Shanna can coordinate the times but i recommend him highly and he would be an asset to EGM. Mike

Do you have a brochure so that i can decide when I can take off and go on to other offices? 
Doug, Thanks for the email.  I am glad that you had a good meeting.  These guys are good and we are committed to this business. I'll be at the Masters Wed - Fri.  Are you going to be there during those days? Mike ""Poling, Doug"" <Poling@WESTPORT.MSMAIL.AIGFPC.COM> on 03/20/2001 06:17:51 PM 
Hi Mike.  As you may know, George brought his full team to our office today to review certain operational issues in connection with our deal, and to introduce key members of the team going forward.  It was very helpful to meet the team members, and to understand a bit better how your coal group is gearing up to be in a position to fulfill Enron's end of the deal once we get the synfuel facility relocated and up and running.  There are a lot of administrative and operational issues that AIG-FP, Enron and Aquila, collectively, are going to have to work through between now and the production start date to ensure that this deal gets off to as smooth a start as possible, but this meeting was a good first step, and appreciated on our end. 
All, I just talked with Andy Fastow and Brian Redmon.  We need to pass on him, they really didn't recommend him as I was led to believe. Sorry, Mike Randal Maffett 03/22/2001 08:42 AM 
I met w/ him a couple weeks ago.  Good guy w/ good overall experience but lacks any specific industry experience in crude/products/pet-chems.  I'm the one who referred him to you and Larry. 
All, Attached is some information on a guy that I just met with and is in re-deployment within Enron.  He is a finance guy by training, and has closed deals as an originator for EE&CC.  (He is not an EE&CC guy but was asked to go over there to help as an assignment)  Andy Fastow recommended that I see him.  I thought of your groups as a possible fit. He is out of redeployment on Friday and if you have an interest to talk to him I would lob in a quick call. Mike 
Per our conversations. Best Regards, Don x56282

Mike, There are a number of opportunities that are presenting themselves in Japan that to prove successful will need some close cooperation between our group (also including metals) and global markets.  I am not implying that the relationship is not working, but as I will describe to you these opportunities are very large and I believe that we will need to ensure that a concerted effort is put forward.  I have briefly alluded to some of these with Jeff and with Gary (as he was in Japan last week) and they both seem interested. Do you have a timeslot tomorrow where I can discuss these with you further? Joe Joseph P. Hirl Enron Japan Corp. 81 3 5219 4500 81 3 5219 4510 (Fax) www.enron.co.jp

Emilio, In David's absence, Habiba has been in touch with Greg Grissom of the sports marketing group.  Greg has confirmed that the Astros have tentatively planned for President Chavez to throw out the first pitch on May 18.  We are exploring the possibility of a reception or other opportunity in cooperation with the Astros.  As you suggested, we'll also look into other potential contacts. I will be back in Houston on Thursday and Keith Miceli will be next Monday. Since it will likely take several weeks to flesh out the opportunities, I'd like to suggest that we limit e-mails to a work group of Habiba, Keith, Greg, you and me until we have more details to review with Mike and Eric.  If you are going to be in Houston during the next two weeks, I'd recommend that we meet.  In the interim, we will keep you apprised of further developments. John Emilio Vicens 03/15/2001 02:30 PM 
John and the rest of the team, Here are some additional data points: 1. In a meeting between Jeff Skilling and President Chavez in late-2000 (I was in the meeting), Jeff invited Chavez to Enron Field as our guess. Obviously, Chavez was only visiting the city for a just hours and I believe the season started just a few days later. In any case, we have already done some previous lobby to get President Chavez to the Stadium. This may help whoever is managing the contant with the Astros (probably David T.). I will probably not get much additional input from Caracas. Nevertheless, I strongly suggest that we position Enron as close as we can to this opportunity (we will later see if President Chavez actually make it to Houston); 2. In addition, in previous trips to Houston and in several ocassions, I believe Chavez has always met with George Bush senior and Mr. Mosbacher. I would not be surprised if he do it again. Probably your team can also target these efforts and keep the action at all fronts; Please keep me informed. I would like to be involved as much as possible to move this ahead. Emilio John Ambler 03/14/2001 01:56 PM 
Emilio, We would be very pleased to pursue this.  By copy of this message I am asking David Tagliarino, who heads the sports marketing group to get more information and opportunities through our contacts with the Astros and Enron Field.  I am in India and Keith Miceli, who covers South America for international public relations, is in Brazil.  While we are out of pocket, I'm asking Habiba Bayi, who directs PR support for EGM, to coordinate our involvement.  (Although international PR will manage meetings, functions, and general support/strategy for this, I also am copying Dennis Vegas since sports marketing reports into him.  As soon as they have information on the potential opportunities, we will get back to you with that information and a suggested program.  If your contacts in Venezuela yield additional details, please let us know.  Otherwise we will pursue it from this end and keep you apprised and involved in the decision making process. John Emilio Vicens 03/13/2001 03:58 PM 
Mike and Eric, It was in the newspaper in Caracas today that Chavez is invited by the Astros (Drayton McLane) to be the guess of honor for the opening night. The Astros played some exhibition games in Venezuela last weekend.  This is obviously a wonderful opportunity for us to get closer to Chavez. Can we do something to be part of this activity with the Astros?, I copied John Ambler to see how we can coordinate the efforts from today. We should not miss this opportunity if it really happen!! Emilio 
Jonathan, Thanks for the update.  Great to have you on board.  This job is going to be great.   I am looking forward to working with you again. Mike Jonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   03/15/2001 02:59 AM 
Just thought I'd update the two of you with my plans. I am leaving Tokyo on the 21st March, and going to London for probably 10 days to get my US Visa done (Unfortunately cannot be done in the US). I will be working out of the London office from the end of next week 100% concentrated on LNG matters, as I have now wrapped up all of my Enron Japan handover. Look forward to seeing the two of you in Houston in early April. Jonathan 
Darrell, I attempted to call you a few minutes ago (late night your time - but there was no voicemail).  I didn't want to wait several more days before I contact you.  I'm out all weekend. Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG opportunity.  I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my thoughts.  Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone else in the company.  They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects.  They are lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that have recently come into the group have.  That is why we have brought them in.   We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot. Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't' done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team.  The biggest opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and books.  That certainly doesn't  mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets.  Rick is in the process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east projects and strategy.  Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly he would like to do in the time of transition.  My very sincere hope is that he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in this type of development or deal making role.  Especially  in a big deal in Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area.  We will discuss this next week when he comes to town. I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and Bahamas immediate activity.  He will certainly be engaged in everything but he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan. Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail. Thanks, mike PS - Frevert also likes this role for Rick.  Also the Eric specific head role has not been officially announced yet. 
Bob, I just tried to contact you but rolled to your voicemail which told me that your mailbox was full and it wouldn't let me leave a message.  The operator then sent me into a Nuevo message that stated that the office was closed. Sorry for my late return call but I've been running at full speed since 6:45 am. Please call when you get a chance.  Also let me know via voicemail if this is urgent. 
David, Howdy.  Thanks for the email.  I agree he is a very sharp guy and does a great job. I will be attending the Masters again this year.  I will be on our 2nd trip which is Wed - Friday.  We do normally have a very full agenda but if you'll leave me your information, I'll try to stop and say hello. Thanks, 
John, I'm sorry I missed you before you went off to Dhabi.  I had difficult mornings while in town.  I'll call you next week to discuss the weather organization structure and the best way to move forward. Have a good holiday.  I think you'll like the UAE. 
Peter, Thanks for your voicemail and email.  Your resume is impressive and I have 2 thoughts.  Most of our efforts in EGM are not asset related but I would suggest you contact 2 people:  Eric Gonzales for LNG activities and possible construction projects and Rick Bergseiker, Middle East and also co-heads LNG. Thanks and good luck. 
Dan, FYI. m 
Chad, thank you for your email.  I will forward on to Dan Reck who is responsible for our new Enron Freight Markets business.  I am sure you will be hearing from him. Thanks, 
I am no longer the CEO for Technology for Enron.  I am  now CEO for Enron Global Markets and do not have any tech. responsibilities.  Please take me of the distribution list. Thank you, 
George, what is that status of this?  Kinder hasn't called on this but probably will.  Let's discuss or leave me an email. thanks, m 
Cheryl, Thanks for the update.  I like the progress. I realize that we can not cover us 100% for the future contract but at least it will help.  What I think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives us a very high bid price to build the house  because we are captive.  What do you suggest as a possible remedy?  Some sort of checks on allowing others to bid?   Some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price?  Without a cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here.  What do you think? A few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax. 2. Earnest money:  I like putting it in title company vs. Flair. 3. Title policy:  Lets go ahead and take the additional coverage, I think it is prudent especially with the new subdivision. How much does an additional 15% cost?  I don't have any idea. 4.  have provided 5.  not sure i understand this 6.  yes, delete 7. definitely change and check b1 and hire an inspector 8. add in clarifying statement 9. agree to add builder obligation.  I am fine with a quick closing date and needs specificity.  Does he have an estimated time of completion? 10. Rollback taxes:  I agree, clarify as to the exemption, we need to be protected here. 11. add this to contract.  Flare may want the money but we should try it. I hope this helps.  After you review and discuss these issues, let's get together via phone and discuss outstanding issues.  Please call Cathy Phillips with a time to talk.  She can be reached at 713 853-6898 Thanks, m ""Cheryl Bach"" <cheryl@flex.net> on 02/26/2001 09:23:59 AM 
Dear Mike: On Friday, February 23, 2001 we received by fax a copy of the Residential Construction Contract Mr. Kent intends on using in connection with the construction of your home.  Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost Plus Contract.  Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.  He indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus basis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made. The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston Builders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one although it is written primarily to protect the builder.  Therefore, we may ask that a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in the indemnity language.  In addition, there may be some other changes we request.  Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at the appropriate time. Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed Restrictions as soon as possible. We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home itself.  When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have to provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the Subcontractors Flair intends on using.  We are sure that the construction lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate time. Should you have any questions or comments, please call us. 
Eric, A couple of high priority activities we need to address very quickly. Run down of Nigeria deal (100/400 mmbtu/d) Bahamas - Skilling update, acceleration of Corp effort, approvals Elba - supply and managing t-o-p Ven - Lay call, timing of Ven decision and game plan R Bergseiker future and other EI people Asia strategy and clarification Current view of Long/Short via category of segment (shipping, physical, facilities) I know you are on top of all of these items but Jeff and I want to run them down and get an update. Thanks,

Don, Thanks for the email and quick response.  I'll address in more detail later, I'm gong out of town again this morning, but I did call Alan Kent and you will have a copy of his standard construction agreement and a copy of the deed restrictions e-mailed today. Also please call Alan directly with any questions on the contract.  Larry is his real estate agent for selling homes in this subdivision and i believe he is just helping him.  Alan should be able to answer most of your questions for clarifications quickly.  I don't need to be an intermediary.  In case you don't have his numbers, he can be reached at his office at 281 376-1500 or cell 281 960-3749. We can discuss the other issues you addressed later when i get a chance to review them more carefully.  We are comfortable with Alan as the builder and want him to build the house, we just want to have a remedy if things don't go well.

STIRMAN & KENNEDY, P.C. ATTORNEYS AT LAW COMPASS BANK BUILDING 25211 GROGANS MILL ROAD, SUITE 120 THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS 77380-2174 E-MAIL: stirman@flex.net WEB PAGE: www.flex.net/~snk DONALD S. STIRMAN, MEDIATOR CLIFFORD L. PARMLEY, M.D., J.D., OF COUNSEL JOSEPH T. KENNEDY ERIC R. HIRD KEVIN T. SHEA TELEPHONE (281) 367-5955 FAX (281) 292-7905 February 22, 2001 Via e-mail Mr. & Mrs. Mike McConnell 13451 Belhaven Drive Houston, TX  77069 RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction Co., Inc., as Seller, and Mike and Chris McConnell, as Buyer Dear Mike: We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to us regarding same dated February 20, 2001.  We want to respond to the questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions and comments about the proposed Contract itself. First, the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction.  The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents. We are interested in knowing, however, if the Contract was filled out by Mr. Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors.  If so, does Mr. Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co., Inc.?  Please advise us accordingly. As we discussed, we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co., Inc. intends on using for the construction of your home.  The fact that Flair is both the Developer, as well as the potential Builder, raises some issues.  Usually, Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same.  Often, lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders.  However, often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want.  We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co. Inc., or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question?  As you point out in your letter, if you sign the Contract as it now reads, you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders. It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision.  We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built, size of lots, etc.  We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood. We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction.  This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible.  If it is outside the city limits, is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services?  Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate.  Usually, until the subdivision is fairly well built out, the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee.  Therefore, if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer. We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co. Inc., to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes, as well as warranty work.  Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to follow-up warranty work after their customers move into their homes.  We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner. The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract.  We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract: 1. Paragraph 2. PROPERTY.  As we previously stated, we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible.  You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association.  Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer, you may want to ask Mr. Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be. 2. Paragraph 5. EARNEST MONEY.  We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co. Inc. 3. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY.  (6)  The standard printed exception as to discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary lines, encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy.  In other words, the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts.  However, if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent (15%) of the policy premium is paid, the title company will probably delete this exception.  This is something you may want to consider.  However, this cost would be yours to incur.  If, however, it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages, then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly. 4. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY, last paragraph.  Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible. 5. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B (3).  It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision.  Therefore, the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots.  If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted, we believe you would need a survey of your lots.  You will have seven (7) days after you receive the Commitment and/or the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly. Therefore, please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same. 6. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY (6).  We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted. 7. Paragraph 7. PROPERTY CONDITION: B (1).  We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph 7B (2) which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition.  Paragraph 7B (1) states that you will pay a fee, usually very small, like $100.00, for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it.  In other words, you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction. We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses.  In addition, there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity.  As the Contract now reads, you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly. 8. Paragraph 8. BROKERS' FEES.  You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers' fees. 9. Paragraph 11. SPECIAL PROVISIONS.  It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 2001, whichever is later.  However, we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity.  The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier.  The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter.  However, we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty (30) days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin. 10. Paragraph 13. ROLLBACK TAXES.  If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property, you need to know.  Otherwise, you will be obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five (5) years. 11. Paragraph 18. ESCROW.  As we indicated earlier, we believe your earnest money should be paid to the title company.  In light of the fact that the earnest money is in excess of $50,000.00 and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain, we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit accordingly. Please call us after you read and review this letter. Very truly yours, Donald S. Stirman DSS/csb 
Thanks, no interest. 
Emilo, Thanks for the information.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do. I know that Neal Gerstandt just joined the company last week and will be working with you on project Jose.  You will find him to be a great guy and a person with excellent judgment and overall experience in the energy industry.  I have known and worked with Neal for over 10 years.  I think he will make a great addition to the team and help bring this deal home.... the largest deal at Enron.

Darryl, I couldn't open your attachment.  Please resend.

Mike This issue has been going back and forth so Eric asked me to send you an email to see if we can resolve this issue.  I have been told by Eric that ProCaribe is in EGM and Mariella continues to say that it is EGA.  I can find reasons for this to fit in either place yet I think it is important to settle this ASAP.  I currently report into both groups so it is in my interest to resolve any misunderstandings as soon as they arise.  I hope all is well. 
We have been notified that Pro-Caribe is part of Enron Global Assets (EGA). In order to facilitate the transition process for EGA-Caribbean , and per Mariella's request, we  have scheduled a meeting for tomorrow, February 15, 2001 at 9:30am CST in conference room 3AC-1665 to discuss detailed business reviews. Topics to focus on are the following: Formal 2001-2003 Budget Key Challenges and Issues Key Decisions (time wise and magnitude wise) Key Business Initiatives Long-Term Strategy and Long-Term Economic Model Dial In Information is as follows: Domestic: 888-232-0365 International:  805-240-9653 Parti. Code:  385387 We would very much appreciate if you could be available to participate and provide the material that will be discussed; if you want to use existing materials to walk us through the list of topics above, that is perfectly fine (don't prepare anything special for us).  If you want to send information in advance, that is also welcomed and appreciated.  Please advise anyone else that you think should be part of this meeting. Please feel free to contact Thanks, Elio 
Shanna, What a deal.  When Jonathan and I talked, he did ask if this deal with Net Works was a problem.  I told him that I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue but to work it out with Eric and i gave him yours and Cindy's name rather than Robert.  Is this out of line with others at his level and responsiblity? Mike 
Rebecca, I would also like to bring Jeff Shankman with me to the board meeting.  He has never attended one. It has been a long time since i have presented anything to board especially like this.  Would you please provide me a copy of the last couple of presentations so that I can be consistent and give them the right kind of information. Thanks,

Enron activity (EOL) Enron's online activity has been very successful especially as compared wit= h=20 our early estimations of acceptance by the industry.  I believe that there = is=20 only one other active coal trading system (Dynegy direct) that simply isn't= =20 posting prices as a bulletin board and waiting for a response with telephon= e=20 follow-up.  I also believe that we have done a very significant amount of o= r=20 maybe all the coal transactions on Dynegy direct to date.

Changes in the industry We discussed changes that we believe are coming in the industry.  We see=20 several things on the horizon.  We expect the acceptance of the online=20 transactions to further increase; especially with the volatile price=20 movements what we have seen in the last 6 months.  We are currently=20 developing several new products for EOL that I believe will become very=20 popular and will create new markets in coal and related sectors.  I don't= =20 want to discuss them right now but we are close to releasing them and I thi= nk=20 they will raise some eyebrows.    The development of the Global Coal exchan= ge=20 will also help.  I frankly don=01,t believe it will be very successful beca= use=20 of several things but primarily because of the difficulty in closing the=20 transaction. One thing has been very firmly demonstrated.  Every time a new= =20 big system has been introduced EOL volumes go up.  It simply accelerates th= e=20 acceptance of online business and it gets down to the best prices and=20 liquidity to see who will ultimately win the day.  Another big change in th= e=20 industry is the growing acceptance of the OTC market.  The significant pric= e=20 changes that have occurred have ""forced"" many traditional players to the OT= C=20 market.  This also includes forcing them to agree to standard OTC terms and= =20 conditions and getting them comfortable with the market.  This is very good= =20 for Enron especially when you consider that we are the major player on the= =20 OTC market.  We don't release specific percentages of what we are doing on= =20 the OTC.  Also having more natural and traditional players signing these=20 types of standard agreements helps us on the EOL side because standard=20 contracts are important for developing a more liquid commodity market.

This doesn=01,t include an= y of=20 our shipping business. I hope this helps and please let me know if you have any other questions. 
Jeff, Let me know what you think.  Please make changes to make more accurate and effective.  I will send this to him and follow up with a discussion.  It needs some work. m draft John, I have just had some additional discussions on our Global weather business and have come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business.   I believe that we do  need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall development and execution of or global strategy and positions.   I have a great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business. We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and Australia.  Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.  This will not be talk but we will get these people in place by specific deadlines.  We will pay all of those people's expenses and they will be on board with the hiring and will be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to their group. On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure. We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to make a change.  We will have weekly calls with him and the weather group to make sure that we are all on the same page and he is up to speed with where we are going.  Jeff did have a video call with Thor to talk about his email and it went well.  Upon my return I learned that Thor and the London group put out a press release about putting out pricing on 1,000 cities and even changing the index.  Neither Mark or Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even brought up in the call as something that was going to happen.  Also the hiring of xxxxxx as a weather  originator, without any discussion, also illustrates the lack of communication or desire to work together.  I am not saying that Mark or Thor are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for not working together, but  we are going to change the future and make sure that it will work better.  I know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to Thor and may not want to transition into EGM and if that is the case, we can make it work via London.  I think the key is our approach to Thor and that this isn't meant as a reflection on him but is a consistent change with how we are running all of our businesses around the world.  The weather piece of his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&L significantly (he'll actually be net positive!) Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure and the best way to communicate it to those involved to make this the most effective. This email is going just to you and Jeff and won't be shared with anyone else. mike 
Congrats, he is a great guy. m Doug Arnell@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/20/2001 11:07 AM 
FYI, this morning I confirmed with Jody Crook (currently an analysist in Texas Risk Management) that he would be joining the LNG group as an analyst beginning March 1.  Jody is clearly a very energetic guy, willing to learn, and I believe he will be a great addition to the team. Thanks 
Sweet-um, Howdy.  Does your AOL work after I go into the work VPN? m 
FYI, there is no official meeting with Chavez. m 
All, At our offsite in Miami next week, each of you are on the agenda to present your business and goals.  This will be very short, only 20 minutes (an agenda will soon follow but we will have a business meeting from 8am - 11:30am on Saturday).  Please prepare a few of pages on power point and submit to Cathy Phillips so that she can have all the presentations ready for that Saturday morning. Attached below is a copy of the abbreviated goals that I submitted to Frevert, summarizing EGM's 2001 goals.  Please do not hesitate to change the list and add to it, it is only a guide and was used as a quick reference of EGM for the Enron board.  After this meeting, I will take each of your presentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for EGM as a business unit.  Also please add some of your other specific goals that illustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive position and/or market share.  For example, to be the largest marketer of coal in the US, to be the largest options player in crude and products, or what ever is appropriate. Also attached, for your information, is a recent  presentation from the coal group.  We thought that this was an excellent format and review.  In the upcoming weeks, we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as well.  I will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and format. Thanks, Mike 
Virginia, we did get the package but can't address right now.  thanks, 
John, This just got sent and it appears you were left of the cc list.  We will be discussing with your guys this week to determine the best way forward. Everyone is under earnings pressure and it is asking too much for someone to dedicate 10-20% of their time on a product.  The intent of this email is not to take people but to add people to the offices, if necessary, to make sure they live, eat and drink weather. We can discuss when I'm in later this week. Mike 
FYI 
I've discussed in detail the strategic outline/process with both John and Larry and they're both in agreement.  We're (EGM Orig. Team) meeting w/ McKinsey this Friday to ""kick it off!""  We'll start implementing the Regional Analysis the following week.  The wheels are in motion! 
Randy, Thanks for the update.  I like your plan.  I like the McKinsey part as well.   Please make sure that Suzanne understands the plan and that you John and Larry agree on the way forward.  If there are any issues, please let Jeff or me know.. m 
John, attached below is my first draft.  It isn't pretty and i would like you comments and changes.  Please make changes directly on the word doucment and send back asap. thanks, m

Ken, I'm back.  Sorry for the delay.  It's been crazy here and I'm very backed up on emails especially the fun ones like this. My brief moment in print (very brief) certainly hasn't gone to my head especially as an Enron  ""B"" teamer.  In response to your worker bee comment, I can certainly say ""buzz"" but not someone who can sell that many shares of stock!  You are the king. Your last email was good and I'm not sure I can respond adequately but at least I didn't get help! You win......but you still owe me lunch. Mike Ken Rice@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/30/2001 07:55 AM 
You're awfully quiet up there.  I guess getting your name in the Wall Street Journal has gone to your head and you can't respond to us lowly worker bees. Mike McConnell@ECT 01/22/01 02:41 PM 
Ken, I had to respond. Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops not  taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job that will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started working on his book ""OU's 7th Football National Championship""; Chapter 3, Who are the Huskers? mike Ken Rice@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/22/2001 10:13 AM 
Luckily, Tom Osborn did not coach at my alma mater.  Our coach was Tom Osborne who, by the end of his career, made OU his bitch. Mike McConnell@ECT 01/22/01 07:16 AM 
Actually, I believe that may be correct.  I verified it in the new book by Tom Osborn,  How OU dominated my coaching career - my only losing record in Coaching.  It was a best seller. m Ken Rice@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/19/2001 05:26 PM 
Excuse me, but I can't remember who it was who handed Oklahoma their worst loss in history. Could it be the ............HUSKERS? Mike McConnell@ECT 01/19/01 03:09 PM

Thanks for the note.   Sooners rule.  We'll find time when things settle down. m Ken Rice@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 01/19/2001 07:24 AM 
Mike I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel. Ken PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college football fan. 
I thought you would get a kick out of this. m 
I'm just the messenger. 
Good luck and let us know, including Rebecca and her team. thanks, m Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/08/2001 06:52 AM 
Oman LNG is now taking a 5-person delegation, including 2 relatively high level government officials, to Bombay to have dinner with DPC on Friday and to meet formally on Saturday.  The Denton Hall lawyer that represented Oman in the LNG negotiations, will also be there. Clay is in Australia and cannot attend, but I will be there for both the dinner and the meeting to manage/referree the discussions.  I will return Saturday night and will visit Adgas/Adnoc on Sunday to update them. Rick 
please print in color, bind and return this afternoon. thanks, m 
Attached is the presentation I distributed during this morning's meeting. It is best viewed in color. Raul 
thanks, 
Jeff, I made a few suggestions and retyped in the document for your consideration.  I added a few words and changed the order.  If you don't like them, go ahead and change them back and send out. Thanks, m 
Shanna, talk with Rick but he will be working until June or July then he will retire and be available as a consultant to us. m Shanna Funkhouser@ENRON 02/08/2001 10:09 AM 
Mike, I wanted to let you know that Cindy Skinner passed the information she gathered on Terry to me.  Please let me know what the status is with his termination ie; timing, etc. so that I may start the process. Thanks, Shanna X59386 
Yes it is.  Listening to clients, a great business model! 
Approved. John Nowlan will make sure that someone from Net Works sees it as well so if they get a call they can discuss it. 
I like it, that is where I am staying! 
Dan,  Eric hasn't called me but if he does you know I'll help. 
Thanks for the update.  We'll discuss again when I am over next week. 
George, I just talked to Rich.  I told him about the timing of the settlement proposal and that we should hear back late next week.  I also suggested that if we get a negative response, that you and i would give him a call and update.   He is being patient but I have a feeling that it has its limits. His response is logical to this point because as he stated, there should be a lot of money in this for both parties and thus a commercial settlement. Mike 
Jeff, I called Joe this morning and left him a pre-email voicemail on this.  I referenced the power of 100% focus and the accountability for someone driving the earnings and his pressure to make earnings in trading and electricity. I like your email and tone.  I would like to recommend you add a statement about Morten being very strong and that we aren't attempting to ""own"" him vs. having a 100%  dedicated weather guy.  I would also add that you want to talk him about this and how we could move quickly to complete our global vision with tawney. MIke 
Randy, I would be happy to sign it with legal approval and Tim Detriming's group must also see it to make sure that we are not obligating ourselves to anything else that is going on around the corporation.  Maffet knows the drill. 
Jeff, here is Gary's review.  It is still on the wrong template and I'll correct today.  Please review carefully and make changes and return. tx m 
John, Thanks, I'll talk with him. 
Jeff, attached is Georges review for tomorrow.  Please review thoroghly, add and make changes and be sure to check for errors.  There is no spell check on the PEP system. Please review and attache the document and return for signature. thanks, mike 
Jeff Shankman.  Steve Kean will also look in occasionally. 
Thanks, Great job, I thought the trip was great and productive.  Maybe next time we'll meet the pres. 
Jeff, My brother had this guy call him and he forwarded his resume.  Do you know him?  Any interest? If you do, please forward on. Thanks, mike 
Lea, You called yesterday.  I am swamped and unavailable.  On Jeff Koons, I am sure that Jeff talked with you last week and he shared his insight from other dealers at your dinner and his comments.  It sounds like we should let him go and not pursue.  I was going to talk with Skilling that day and elected to drop it after that.  See you on Monday. 
Jeff, I couldn't open the attachment and there was no name reference.  Who is this? 
Renee, Wow!  I was so happy to get your email.  Congrats.  You guys make a cute couple.  I'll try to attend, it is on the calendar. 
All, After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have all the facts during the PRC process. This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of us for the appropriate time. Thanks, 
Any interest? - Maybe for Randy or Doug? m

fyi 
I just wanted to make sure you guys know everything I do.  Actually this is somewhat bullish considering past legislative attempts. 
Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous Congresses. We expect it to include: 1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout schedule 2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State governors within 90 days from date of enactment 3)  and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for conventional gasoline) 
Greg, I received request for our goals on a voicemail while coming back from Venezuela.  I didn't know exactly what you  were looking for or the audience but i have listed a few initial goals and thoughts for each business unit. We are in the process of creating more specific goals for each group for 2001.  Each already has their own but they are not in a final and consistent format.  We have an off-site meeting later this month in which we will address this as a group.  In addition, George and the coal group completed theirs late last week and Mark Tawney is returning tomorrow with re-defined goals as part of the process. Also, I have attached some new global formats that I received as I was leaving the country on some specific items that we need to insure a successful year.  Most of this information has never been put together before.  I have projected out a 50% growth factor as a starting point and will break this down to specific groups and goals to insure that we will meet these goals.  As you know a lot of this was started when I put together the EGM presentation and gathered information for the analyst meeting. Let me know if you need something else or if this is not what you are looking for. Mike 
Jeff attached are the first drafts of the following reviews.  Please review and make changes on the document itself.  This is not in any final form and will have numerous errors.  Please make corrections as you go along as well. There is no spell check on this form. Gary and George are tomorrow morning. Mike 
DH, Here is my first draft for Rick's review.  It is not complete and was done on an airplane.  It needs work but I didn't want to hold it up.  Please make any changes and additions on the attached word document and send it back. Thanks, mike 
Emilo, A few things that I want to make sure that we have in our briefing package. A map of the region and facility Assessment of country risk address concern that a lot of ""old"" money (big Landowners) are taking their money out of the country - something we shouldn't ignore Update on other Ven. activities for ENE Other How is this going to work with translators? Earlier meetings with Ministers? We want to have a dinner the night before with key people We are now flying out after the meeting on Friday on the company plane. 
Shanna, I certainly believe that Jennifer is better than Kim.  Jeff is certainly the appropriate judge but she is very young and has a lot yet to learn.  This comment is not meant as a cut down at all.   John's questionable judgement shouldn't just be trumped however. My thoughts, m Shanna Funkhouser@ENRON 01/30/2001 07:44 PM 
Mike and Jeff, I wanted to let you know that Kim Hillis is being promoted from Sr. Admin to Executive Assistant. Cathy Phillips, Nicki Daw and Kay Chapman are also Executive Assistants. Please let me know if we need to re-visit a promotion for Jennifer and whether it should be considered now, mid year or at a later time. Thanks, Shanna 
Shanna, I'm supportive of the raise to $150k.  I think he is doing a good job and has a lot of value.  He didn't fair well during the ranking due to lack of big $ or closure but maybe this will send him a good message. Thanks, 
Bruce, I've been out of the office until Monday afternoon since the day of our meeting.  I forwarded your presentation to several individuals that night. I'll follow back with them and get back to you. thanks, m Bruce N Stram@EES 01/25/2001 12:21 PM 
Any further thoughts on our commodities trading discussion, re: CWT technology? 
Jeff, Interesting.  Do you like this guy?  What about Crude and products origination working for Randy?  On the LNG front we should look at him if you like him but i don't think it is a no brainer.  Neal will be coming on in 2 weeks, do we need him?  Maybe we do. 
Tuesday is fine but i do need it. 
Thanks, m Enron North America Corp. 
Jeff and John, Attached is the most recent draft of the reorg announcement.  Cathy will have this ready to go out tomorrow, close of business.  Please review again and mark up any changes that you believe are required.  Please read the Per and Randy section carefully for errors and wording.  JN, Please change wording for Randy's most recent assignment, i put something down as a marker.  Also come up with a 1 sentence lead for Randy on the expected growth and opportunities around his efforts. Please read carefully for better wording and errors.  Return to Cathy by 2 pm and we will make final changes and send it out at 6pm. Thanks, Mike

Marty, I can't attend and sent it on to Jeff Shankman.  I really like the concept and would like to see the end product and the presentations.  Are you taping it? Its a great idea and format.  Thanks for inviting me. 
FYI, I think this is interesting.  I won't be able to attend but do you have any time to see some of this.  The morning looks interesting.  What do you think? m 
I would really like that.  I don't have any specific suggestions. mike

John, This is a follow-up to our earlier discussion.  I would like to have you lay out our physical crude needs to become a player a long with some action steps to accomplish the goal.  I don't want to forget about this because I believe it may be something we need to assign someone or a mid-market or originator or team to accomplish.  I would like to see foreign and domestic. I see this as one of our possible competitive advantages or at least to solve the problem of not being in the know and getting second hand info or pricing. Thanks, 
Robert, Thanks,  I've talked with EES - Tom White and I will forward on his resume for consideration.  I will also talk with Stan Horton. 
Ken, I had to respond.

Mike I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel. Ken PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college football fan. 
Paul, I am in the early stages of planning my next run to Singapore and Sydney.  I was thinking about bringing my wife and staying over a couple of days (or a week).  What is the weather like in July and are you going to be there? Thanks, 
Paul, FYI, you were invited to our off-site because we felt that our businesses were so linked together and that we could all get on the same page with regard to updates, vision and relationship building.  We also invited Joe and Thor as the only other non-EGM people.  If you can make it would be great but we do know how difficult it is to make it over.  I did hear your California request and it could happen.  We haven't found the right place yet. California is experiencing serious blackouts and it could be difficult. We'll be in touch. Cheers,

Thor, I am sorry that you can't make it but please don't worry about it.  We wanted to invite you as an important business leader and give you an update on our businesses and also have you share your vision and accomplishments of your great work in Norway.  We intended to only invite 3 non-EGM officers, Joe Hirl, Paul Quilkey and you. I hope you have a great holiday. Cheers, mike Thor Lien 01/18/2001 11:42 PM

Luckily, Tom Osborn did not coach at my alma mater.  Our coach was Tom Osborne who, by the end of his career, made OU his bitch. Mike McConnell@ECT 01/22/01 07:16 AM

Virginia, Hello.  I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph.  I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London, William Weston.  They should be delivered this week.  They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.  By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.  I have also purchased an Appel in the last month. I am interested in several artists.  Actually, a lot.  I will be looking for one or more of the following.  My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like.  I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my wife's favorites and priorities).  They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.  I want signed and numbered.  I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision.  I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.  For example, I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper. At least that is what I am thinking now. Bonnard (colorful only) Lautrec Suerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any) Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos Braque Moore Arp Rouault Modrian Rothko Kline Motherwell By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) that your gallery had a couple of years ago.  It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a ""push wa"" (pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling).  It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $20,000.  Is there 1 available?  Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one. Thanks,

John, Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather situation.  Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to review it this week.  Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth any more of our time.  For what it is worth, I think our communication strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed to be.  These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well.   For a P&L that is this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.  There is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to bigger and better things. I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the other issues and problems on my plate.  Let's discuss upon your return on our weekly call. Thanks and I hope your vacation was relaxing. Mike ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email.

As requested... 
Kathie, Thank you for your email.  I've been out and all over the world.  I appreciate your help on this article.  Attached is a copy of a presentation that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.  This should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft. Here are a few other points of emphasis. EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and commodities to enable them to grow quickly These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being active in them EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are enormous in market size EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset positions EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale businesses EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first  2 quarters in existence Go big or go home philosophy EGM will represent a clear transfer of  Enron wholesale market making model into other commodities this year GROWTH is the key!!! Thanks for your help. Mike

Good Morning, Mike! Mark Frevert has requested that we continue our efforts to profile the various officers of EA, EGM and EIM in the newsmagazine.

Christie, a couple of comments on the 3rd paragraph on page 11.  It is up to you to decide if it is worth correcting.  I didn't know if you had a chance to make the writing better or simply correct mistakes. 1.  Page 11:  I was president of Houston Pipe Line and Louisiana Resources Company.    The term, ""Enron pipeline subsidiary"" isn't real or correct.  You could also restate with, head of Enron's non-regulated pipelines, head of two pipelines, head of an Enron pipeline subsidiary ; something like that. 2.  Page 11:  On the 5th sentence, it is mixing a couple of thoughts.  I would like to add something like, (after officer,) and establishing a unified vision, 3.  Page 11:  typo.  There needs to be an ""an"" in the last sentence before the word extension. Thanks, mike Christie Patrick 01/08/2001 10:41 AM 
Friends, Attached is the ""Final"" draft of the Harvard Business School case study prepared by Harvard Professor Chris Bartlett and his research assistant Meg Wozny. [please scroll down to the end of the next message for the attachment] .  The content was developed from interviews with most of you. Please review the case and let me know of any desired edits/corrections/comments as soon as possible. [One obvious correction is the spelling of Cindy Olson's last name]. We'd like to ""sign off"" on this within the next 2 or 3 days. Harvard professors are excited about teaching this case this coming semester.  In fact, Professor Don Sull will be focusing largely on this Enron Case this semester, culminating in ""Enron Day"" at Harvard Business School April 26th, featuring Jeff Skilling. Also, Chris and Meg will be in Houston this Thursday, Jan. 11th, 'capping off' their work with video interviews with Ken, Jeff and Louise, which will help ""bring the case to life"" for the students studying it. Please forward any edits/corrections/comments to me via E-Mail or via hard copy (please deliver to EB 4710, or call me [3-6117] and we'll have it picked up). Thanks  to everyone for all your contributions to this exciting work! --Christie. 
Christie: Congratulations!  I don't know how you manage to work full-time at Enron and study for a PhD at the same time.  Sounds superhuman to me! The FedEx was marked for Saturday delivery, but in case you haven't received it yet, I'm enclosing the draft as an attachment. It would be great if we could get Enron's approval during our visit.  (I know professors at HBS are interested in teaching that case as soon as it's available.)

Mike, Thank you for your suggestion.  I was hoping that you could either forward this message to Mr. Philippe Bibi or email me his contact information and I will get in touch with him.  We are very interested in having someone represent Enron in our Premier 100 IT Leaders list. Thank you in advance. Allison Mike.McConnell@enron.com on 01/05/2001 02:55:56 PM 
Allison, Thank you very much for the email and request.  As much as i an very proud of our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am still of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified candidate from Enron.   Enron has changed its culture and business around technology and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates. EOL ended the year over with over $330 billion in transactions.  EOL was only 1 part of our transformation however. Thanks again and good luck with your award.

We are now reviewing the finalists, but still hoping to hear from you in time to include you among those being considered for this prestigious award. All we need is a small chunk of your time to complete the attached survey, then return it by e-mail to premier100@computerworld.com or fax it to (508) 875-8931 by Tuesday, January 9th. Thank you very much for your time, and we hope to hear from you. If you have questions, or if I can help in any way, please don't hesitate to call me directly.

Dear Mr. McConnell, my name is Rudy Hirschheim, and I'm the past Director of the Information Systems Research Center at the University of Houston. Enron is a member of our group and I was friends with Alberto Gude, Enron's former IT Director. I have a request that I wondered if you could help with. Perez Companc - a big oil and gas company in Argentina - is trying to understand how some of the big US companies are dealing with IT. Basically interested in issues such as sourcing arrangements, structure (centralized/decentralized/distributed), customer relationships, use of packaged software, 'e' issues, and such like. They want me to try to set up meetings with some key US companies here in Houston. Among the companies which I suggested they talk to is yours. Do you think someone/some group would be willing to talk to a contingent of Perez Companc folks? Would Enron be willing to share things which weren't considered competitive secrets with them?? They were hoping to come up either the first or second week in March. My role is to try to put together visits to the Shell/Texaco JV, Shell, Texaco, Exxon-Mobil, Conoco, BHP, Enron, Chevron. Do you think it is possible? Again, nothing of a competitive nature has to be offered, they just are trying to determine what they ought to be doing with respect to IT. Thanks in advance. ------Rudy Hirschheim ************************************************************ Rudy Hirschheim Tenneco/Chase International Chair & Professor of Information Systems C.T.

Mike, My apologies for bothering you on your holiday.  Dr. Irani has had the opportunity to visit with HRH, the Foreign Minister on a couple of occasions in the past week.  We have been given a few insights that I would like to share with you.  The most significant is the suggestion that we request permission from the Negotiating Team to begin discussions with the other short-listed companies about possible consortium arrangements.  We want to make sure that Enron is comfortable with that at this stage.  Our intent would be to have very high-level contacts to guage interest but not to make any commitments at this point. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you. Best regards and I hope you had a great holiday, Casey Olson 
Cindy, I have addressed this previously with Jeff and Louise Kitchen.  We have no interest.  Please co-ordinate with Robert and make sure that someone sends him a nice rejection letter. Thanks, Mike 
Hi Mike, I just wanted to follow up on the below email.? Hope all is well. Regards, Joseph P.

Dear Mike, My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.? I have worked very successfully with Greg Whalley, Jeff Shankman, Fred Lagrasta, John Arnold, Duane Hart, Amanda Martin, Harold Buchanan, among others in the past.? I had also authored a financial products paper with Louise Kitchens that was published by two European trade magazines in the spring of 1997. I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading exchange.? We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going quite well. However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration, as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Enron Global Markets. My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.? I have been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work. I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com. Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking and capital markets. Attached is a copy of my resume.? My goal is to procure a challenging leadership position within your group in the capacity of Business Developement, Corporate Finance, Mergers & Acquisition, or Venture Capital.? I would be open to other suggestions. Please review my resume when you get a chance.? I appreciate that you are very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see a fit between what I can offer and what your group is doing. Best Regards, Joseph P.

Thanks for your hospitality.  We had a great time. Sooners rule!  It was unbelievable being at the game. 
Tom, I am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends on your view of the middle east adjustment.  I don't want to be hard on this and get back a bigger number on middle east by default.  Its up to you and your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with Europe. I am fine with your ultimate decision. Mike

Greg, Mark and I would like to thank you again for your efforts to get us on at Doral.  We had a great time and got a chance to meet Tom.  He was a gracious host and please pass on another thank you for us. Mike McConnell Greg Grissom@ENRON 12/28/2000 01:44 PM 
Mike and Mark- I wanted to confirm with you that you have a 2 PM tee time on Wednesday, January 3rd at the Doral Resort and Spa's Blue Course (The Blue Monster).  My future father-in-law, Tom Neville, the Tournament Director for the Genuity Championships (formerly the Doral Ryder Open), has reserved your tee time and should you have any problems please contact him at the tournament office (305-477-4653 ext. 3058). He also suggested that you might want to arrive a little early because there could be a possibility of teeing off a little earlier than 2 PM.  FedEx has a tournament scheduled beginning with shotgun start at 9 AM and depending on quickly they get around, you could get on the course before 2:00. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me here at work, (713) 345-8741, or on my cell phone, (713) 582-7596. Hit it straight and Go Sooners! Greg Grissom 
Allison, Thank you very much for the email and request.  As much as i an very proud of our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am still of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified candidate from Enron.   Enron has changed its culture and business around technology and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates.  EOL ended the year over with over $330 billion in transactions.  EOL was only 1 part of our transformation however. Thanks again and good luck with your award. Sincerely, Mike McConnell ""Allison Wright"" <Allison_Wright@computerworld.com> on 01/02/2001 09:58:45 AM

Mary, I would be happy to talk with anyone about this.  The story did have some mistakes.  Tom was correct in his statements.  By the way, I never saw the draft before it ran.  I think I would have caught the errors.   If I saw it before the printing, I must have simply said ok without reading it but neither Cathy nor i remember an email on it. Mike Mary Clark@ENRON 01/02/2001 10:47 AM 
Mike, see the employee feedback below on the JDF story in Vol. 6 of Enron Business.  It might be a good idea to talk with MaryAnn Roman de Meza (Wellness) about how we might communicate information about diabetes detection and treatment to employees.  What do you think? Mary 
Should we forward this to Mike? 
Hi, I'd like to suggest you publish something on diabetes to correct what I think are misconceptions or inaccuracies in the article ""Enron employees set new record with walk to knock out diabetes"" that appeared in the recent copy of Enron Business.  I am not an expert, so you should not publish any of my comments, but should contact an expert in the treatment of diabetes. You quoted Mike McConnell as stating that weight gain is a normal symptom of untreated diabetes.  My experience is that weight gain is often a CAUSE of diabetes, whereas weight loss is often a SYMPTOM.  It would be useful to clarify this, as some people with undiagnosed diabetes could delay seeking help on the basis of the quotation made. The quote ""...insulin is not a cure nor does it prevent the development of complications.  It is merely life support.""  is totally at odds with the experience of the diabetics I have known, and could be quite alarming to someone recently diagnosed.  Most people on insulin need make only very small changes to their lifestyle and diet.  Properly managed diabetes eliminates almost all complications - the body effectively functions normally with the addition of insulin.  damage caused prior to diagnosis can not be reversed of course.  The suggestion that insulin is merely life support is alarming - insulin is life support, but not ""merely"" life support.  Life can be lived fully, and while there are probably some activities that can not be participated in, I have not met a diabetic who has experienced this.  No complex equipment is needed, the treatment is very quick, portable, inconspicuous, etc.  It can not be compared to dialysis for renal failure, for example, which is much closer to ""merely life support"".  Even so, many people on dialysis still live good lives. I think it would be very useful for you folks to publish something that helps people diagnose both types of diabetes, how they can avoid the adult onset type, and the effect on lifestyle of diabetes.  Perhaps you could find some nice statistics such as the most common method of diagnosis is when the patient goes into a comma due to high blood sugar (at least in some countries), diabetes is the leading cause of non-accidental amputations, adult blindness, renal failure, etc, and that the materials for a blood test cost about $1. yours Tom Halliburton 
Jonny, Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another copy and don't need it. Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.  I hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating Madeline's birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting old. I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him. Please let me know the situation. Cheers and Boomer Sooner, 
Thanks for the email.  The game was great and my throat still hurts.  I've never been to a better event or had as much fun.  I'll be calling Roberts. mike 
All, I came back from the big dance last night.  It was a real privilege to be there.  I've been to 15 OU/TX games and the energy, excitement and overall electricity in the orange bowl beat them all put together.  It was wild and a moment that I will never forget. Bob Stoops for president!  He is the king. The best was at the end of the game (and everyone stayed around celebrating until about 1:30 am) when they said, ""there was the Wilkenson era, there was the Switzer era and welcome to the Stoops era.  Oklahoma is back"". Boomer Sooner, 
Pelt, we are at the Hyatt - Coral Gables:  305 - 441-1234 Mike ""Jonny Jones"" <jjones@jonesenergy.com> on 12/28/2000 09:34:32 PM 
I just got the tickets the day I left for Telluride.  Why don't we just pick you guys up for the game.  We aren't arriving until 3:00 on game day.  We're staying at the Breakwater Hotel on South Beach (305) 532-1220.  I will have my mobile phone (512) 426-1033.  What Hyatt are you staying at. Your Spring Break schedule is great. 
Greg, thanks a lot for your help.  This is a great surprise. 
thanks for the update.  be sure and get on my calendar when you are in town. Call Brent Price (our CAO) at 713 853 7647 for additional help on Mtm.  He is very good. Good luck, 
cool. m 
In case you haven't seen this photograph. Rebecca 
Thanks, I had not seen it.  Happy New year. 
Pup, Hope your holiday is going great.  Talked with your office and got your Telluride number but you guys must be out playing.  OU game is coming quickly.  Chris is not going down, Mark and I only, and we are arriving to Miami on Tuesday afternoon and staying at the Hyatt.  We are out on Thursday afternoon.  Golf on Wednesday afternoon at Doral.  It should make for a fun trip. When are you guys going down and where are you staying?  We need to set up a time to get together and to get the tickets.  Have you heard anything on Hieple (bad spelling) arm?  If he is healthy I would take the points! We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.  We plan to fly out on Tuesday and return on Saturday.  I have a scheduling problem to get there any earlier. Give me a call if it is convenient, (713) 853-1450.  I've got a very light schedule on Friday, or you can email, whichever is easier. See you in a couple of days! Love to all, Mike 
FYI 
My January is very bad, how about early Feb? Mike Emilio Vicens@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/19/2000 01:39 PM 
Mike, Jeff and Eric, With the recent change of the President of PDVSA and the already announced departure of the Minister of Energy and Mines in January, there has been a significant amount of noise in Venezuela with respect to export projects in general.  I believe it is critical for very senior Enron people to make a direct pitch to the President of the country as soon as we can arrange one. We need to let the President know directly the benefits of the project and the strong commitment of Enron to the development of the project.  We have alreday done this several times, but it is time to do it again. I recommend a visit in early January of maybe Frevert or you Mike (maybe both). We can also use this visit to have meetings with the new President of PDVSA and, hopefully, if there is an official Minister appointed with the new Minister.  It is not easy to fit in the President's agenda, so please advise the course of action and tentative dates. Thanks, Emilio 
John,=20 I hope you and Lorraine are having a great holiday season. =20 Sorry for the slow reply but I tried to only work on critical items over m= y=20 holiday.  Yes, this is only a marketing desk and it really only includes 1= =20 person, Ross,  who doesn't want to move to Oslo.  I didn't think it was a b= ig=20 thing and that is why I didn't get back with you.  It wasn't a big part of= =20 the memo and i didn't focus a lot on it.  I would expect him to co-ordinate= =20 daily with Thor.  I believe he works for Thor but we didn't  address it in= =20 the discussion or memo.  I'll watch it and see if it becomes an issue.  I d= o=20 know that Mark and Thor have talked about it and I believe Thor likes Ross= =20 and is OK with his function in London.  We are not attempting to recreate t= he=20 wheel in London or around Thor. =20 See you when you come to town. Mike John Sherriff 12/19/2000 01:29 AM 
After re-reading your note - I see that it is not a trading desk in London= =20 but a marketing desk=20 - but it is still unclear to me how this fits into the Oslo desk.  Also=20 shouldn't we be talking about this or your=20 guys talking to Thor who is running the European Weather business? John

Brent, Excellent update.  I would like to see the breakdown by pieces for a potential write-down especially volume difference only and look at a 1 year adjustment to begin. Thanks, Mike Brent A Price 12/27/2000 11:21 AM 
First Gas is a liquid fuel supply deal executed in May, 1997 that is linked to a power plant in the Phillipines.  Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between 10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is linked through the end of 2001. To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of the deal. In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, 2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level for the foreseeable future. To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately $3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount. On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout 2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue. Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can give us in this matter. 
Dianne, Thanks for the kind words.  Yes toastmaster has been a big influence in my life.  I talk about it often and attribute a great deal of my success to that.  I do large speeches quite often and its all back to our morning meetings and they seem like they were a lifetime ago. thanks, 
David, Thanks for the nice note.  I hope you and your family are having a great holiday season.  Please don't hesitate to call me if you come in for a meeting, it would be great to see you again. Sincerely, mike david winkle <dnwinkle@yahoo.com> on 12/21/2000 03:24:13 PM 
Dear Mike, Thank you for the introduction to David Tagliarino. We spoke at length yesterday, and he seems like a very good guy.  He also seemed very receptive to the possibility of us working together, and I am hoping to schedule a meeting with him in the near future.  In the meantime, I sent him some information on our company, and the players we represent.  I am confident that we can be of help to you, and obviously, we would appreciate the opportunity to do so. I know that you have been very successful at Enron, and I am happy for you.  I am sure things will only get better. If I am fortunate enough to schedule a meeting with David, I would love to stop by your office and say hello.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime, I wish you and your family a happy holiday season, and again, I appreciate your help. Sincerely, David N. Winkle __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Mike, I am playing in the Rhubarb at Champions on the 28th with another guy I've played in several tournaments with.  However, they have switched the format this year to 3 man teams, and wondered if you have any interest. Either give me a call 3-4278, or reply by e-mail. Hope you have a merry Christmas. Jimmie

All, Here is the latest draft.  Please make any changes you want and return. Paper mark up is best.  Also please leave as a separate word document if you do it via email  for ease of changing and converting to email late afternoon. Cathy, please review for your normal grammar and corrections.  I realize that this is a draft but it will help to have your changes early even though we will be making additional changes in the afternoon. Larry, I would like your feedback and commentary as well. Thanks, mike 
Yes, CP, please include. m 
should we invite mark wadington? Jeff

Our ability in crude is apparently very poor.  What can J Wilson do thru 2010?  I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable volume. If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru this structure.  Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain what the effort potentially create. Thanks Eric Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Thanks.  Not impressive. 
Paul, Thanks.  I am making changes and taking out the word ""trading"" wherever possible and I will send you a revised copy when it is ready. Mike Paul Quilkey@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/10/2000 04:02 PM 
Mike Thanks for the presentation.  Sorry that I will miss you the week of Dec 18. Look forward to catching up in the New Year. rgds Paul 
John, thanks for the comments.  Absolutely on the trader comment, I forgot.  I like the ag business and we are looking at several oppts and making a final determination in Q1.  I also think ""softs"" is a big oppt that is probably worth pursuing.  More later. I like the weather idea as well. On another note, I met this guy when I spoke at the AA Energy symposium.  He runs a power business (i think) in Portugal.  He has attempted to talk to someone at Enron in Europe but hasn't heard back.  He has given me his email address and requested a contact.  Would you please make sure that someone follows up with him. Company:  Finertec, SA (?) luis.reis@finertec.pt Thanks, Mike John Sherriff 12/08/2000 11:48 AM

Hi Mike, Hope all is well and hope that you were able to spend a little time at home over the holidays.Congrats on the Sooners season, what an exciting year with one big game to go. Are you going to Miami? Spoke with Brenda last night and she said they had a great time at the big 12 championships and are planning to go to Miami for the National Championship game. Sure wish my Horns were going, I guess we have to settle for another sunny, San Diago. I here we are having Duck(OREGON) for dinner. Good luck in Miami, I will be rooting for your Sooners (that's hard to say). Give me a call when you get a chance so we can follow up on Enron and Nexstar opportunities. Thank.  Hook-em, Don

Gentlemen: Attached for your review and follow-up is Randy Roberts' resume. Randy's has an interesting background in trading that may be of value to your organization. I met Randy through one of our stars in the law department: Michelle Blaine. George Wasaff 
Brent, I would like to illustrate the growth of our commodities to show why this a  great business unit and why this is a big focus for wholesale.  Also we will use all of this for the Jan analyst meeting. Please compile some facts on each business by 1. number of transactions 2. revenues 3. on line growth of each 4. size of each commodity;  e.g.:  number of barrels traded, tons of coal, tons of freight, etc. 5. other metrics that you think will illustrate the point Go back as many years as you can get data. Thanks, mike Go ahead and send me preliminary copies of the figures as it is being compiled. 
You've got to have faith. m 
RAC came by and brought up a couple of concerns.  1- the Var on this deal is over $120m (more than all of ENE combined); they wanted to make me aware of the size, and they know we are working on it. and 2 - EE&CC; they were concerned about them doing the deal and their abilities and effects on MTM treatment.  I told them that they can bid on it but we want others to bid and that we probably won't use them.  They stated that the deal guys are acting like EE&CC is a done deal. Lets discuss. Thanks, 
FYI and consideration. m 
Our ability in crude is apparently very poor.  What can J Wilson do thru 2010?  I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable volume. If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru this structure.  Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain what the effort potentially create. Thanks Eric Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Jonny, Howdy, I bet you had a great time at the game.  I did watch it and it never felt good and I am still amazed at the outcome.  Did it feel different actually being there? Are you going Miami?  Mark and I may be in.  What about you?  I figured for sure that you are already making plans.  Also, do you think it will be impossible to get tickets? We are in for spring break.  We will not be able to be there the entire week and we are looking at the exact dates and my schedule - but count us in. If you get a chance why don't you give me a call and we can catch up. Mike PS - Enron stock was down $15/share, ouch.  No partiuclar reason mainlly huge sector movement. ""Jonny Jones"" <jjones@jonesenergy.com> on 11/27/2000 10:45:15 AM 
He sure does not look like a Heisman winner to me.  We will wait to hear your spring break plans. 
Speaking of great to be back... we are heading to Kansas City on Saturday. If O.U. plays in the National Title game we are going to try to go.  Any interest? I can probably come up with some tickets. Spring Break for us is also the 12th - 16th.  We have not made any other plans.  Lets ski in Telluride. Continental fly's direct from Houston to Montrose, but the flights book pretty early.  I just checked and there are two flights per day and seats are available. Let me know if you need help with your travel plans.  We will go up on Friday the 9th and return on Sunday the 18th so whatever schedule you can make is great.  We will have you picked up at the airport, no problem. Jonny 
Jeff, attached is an expanded 1st draft of the memo.  I would like to keep this expanded format to show the progress that we have made in the group. Please make any changes and send back for the next round.  After we both look at it 1 more time, we will circulate to the heads of the group for commentary.  I would like to have them feel part of the memo. Mike 
Chris, thanks for the email.  I don't have a need.  Thanks for letting us know. 
Elise, Thanks for the email.  In August i changed jobs and am now the CEO for Enron Global Markets.  I am no longer in the technology sector (although I enjoyed it very much and it was a difficult decision to leave).  Please remove me from your email list for further HTC events. Thanks and good luck, 
Jeff, I can't sleep and have been cleaning out emails.  Not my favorite past time at 2:30am.  I didn't see the draft reorg memo we've been talking about for a while.  Please send it to me for my review.  I think it is important to get something out and i believe that people expect some changes 
I couldn't sleep so ive been doing emails, its looking a little better.  And I didn't get up in the middle of the night and come into the office.  I think I'll try again and can still get a few hours sleep. I will be in a little later than I expected, I must drop young Michael off to school and cant leave there until 8. See you in the morning. 
John, You caught me.  I've been hit again with the bug, the 3rd time in November, and the combination of drugs has me wide awake.  I did promise Chris that I wouldn't run off to the office when this occurs but she didn't tell me I couldn't do a lot of emails from home! - there is always a catch! Actually I'm back to bed to try again after this one. Hope all is well in merry old England. Cheers, Mike John Sherriff 11/30/2000 01:56 AM 
Thanks Mike - are you up in the middle of the night again? John Mike McConnell 30/11/2000 07:39 
John, I'm in.  She was outstanding.  If you don't want her, I'll take her! I have a PRC conflict during the next execom meeting.  If i'm not there please feel free to pass on my strong support. Cheers, Mike 
Thanks for the email and kind words. I did recover over thanksgiving and it was nice but I am sick once again and cant' sleep.  I am catchin up on this emai at 2:15 wednesday night.  I will try and go back to bed after this email. Let me know how the contract goes, i don't see any issues.  I actually thought it got done and that is why i havent heard anything. Sooners have looked ugly lately, Saturday will not be a good day for the Sooners. Mike 
Guys, I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some facts to get back to him. What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online? Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online? Other changes you see or products to develop International effects Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online Other competing exchanges and why ours is better Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it relates to paradigm changes or online changes Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I need this information pretty quickly. Thanks, m 
Thor, Very creative and i bet everyone had fun.  We need to try it over here.  I bet it would go over here as well.  Thanks for sharing the story. mike Thor Lien 11/24/2000 01:22 AM 
As discussed with Mark, I have set up a summary of what we did to get people interested in weather trading at the Marketing event that we had here in Oslo. Background: First we wanted to do something new that would promote Enron positively. (There are a lot of conferences with happenings for power traders) Most of the participants were traders or very interested in trading. Could we do any deals that evening? We invited them because they should start doing deals with Enron. Several of the companies attending needed to change their risk policy to do weather deals. Lottery: We made a lottery that was similar to a weather deal. But we made the option premium to 15,-  Nok and max payment if the option stroked to 100,- NOK. Our counterparties should not loose a lot of money, so they paid the premium upfront and they was not allowed to sell any options. The counter parties, that were the traders and not the companies, did their first weather deals with Enron.  It was important that the traders could go short or long or both. (Buy both put and call, for the traders that was afraid of their possitions) Some bought 10 contracts and they really felt that they traded weather deals. The most positive in my opinion was that over 20 companies have traders that have done weather deals already. Enclosed Lottery weather contract Deal/Guest list 
Thanks. 
Users, Cathy Phillips 
I glanced at it and it appears fine from my perspective.  Others should make the determination on its effects in the Spanish and European markets. 
John, I'm in.  She was outstanding.  If you don't want her, I'll take her! I have a PRC conflict during the next execom meeting.  If i'm not there please feel free to pass on my strong support. Cheers, 
What do you think?  Is this worth my or someone else's time? m 
June 10, 11 ,12 the Canadian Energy Research Institute will host a petrochemical industry conference in a mountain resort 60 miles from Calgary. Our steering committee (Dow Nova, Williams, Shell chemicals, Canadian Pacific Railway, BP) has suggested that we ask you to address delegates on Enron's leadership role in e-business. I am making initial contact to explore this possibility, and to ask if is possible for you to recommend an alternative person within Enron, as I have lately learned you have changed positions. This is a high level conference for industry decision makers, which will give you an idea for this presentation: not necessarily the IT approach, more of a business strategy approach. I look forward to hearing from? you. Best Regards. April Wright 
Thanks for the article.  I love to read things like this. 
Rebecca, Attached, for your information, is a copy of EGM's 2001 plan.  I don't remember if i sent you a copy earlier. mike

I sent this to all the guys and forgot to include you on the distribution. m 
Dear Mike, Thank you for taking the time to meet with me this afternoon in spite of your busy schedule.  Your encouragement is appreciated, especially in light of the uncertainties resulting from the substantial shift in Enron's business paradigm.  I look forward to communicating with the individuals you suggested--in particular, Randy Maffett, Per Seska, Mark Tawney, and Eric Gonzales. As you requested, attached below is my resume.

Howdy, Kansas City will be great.  Thanks for the invite but I can't go.  I pray that the Nebr. Sooners show up,  not the Sooners of the last 3 weeks.  We really look awful.  Early peak? That's great news for spring break.  Let me talk to the boss and let her know that is still and option and see if it still works. Thanks, Mike Go Sooners.

Pelt, Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I needed the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank God. Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up. I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks co-ordinated and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go skiing.  We didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last discussion a while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th . Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that you are in Telluride right now on holiday. Give my love to all. Mike PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun year.  It is nice to be back. 
Karen, yes i like the ""sauces"" reference.  I sound like an idiot.  I can understand his mistake but i thought i discussed what it meant.  Skilling will love that reference. mike Karen Denne@ENRON 11/20/2000 04:23 PM 
Mike -- As soon as I get hard copies of the article, I'll send them to you. The article is also on ComputerWorld's website.  (FYI, your quote should be ""Might we get into softs or meats or grains.""  i checked my notes...)  karen 
William, I am very interested in both the Signac and Cross. A few  questions about the pieces.  You referenced Meier Graefe for ""Pan"" for both pieces.  I don't know what that means could you please clarify?  Also I don't understand the reference to an Album.  Is the Signac numbered?  Are either signed on the stone? Thanks, mike ""William Weston"" <ww@williamweston.co.uk> on 10/27/2000 11:14:22 AM 
Dear Mr McConnell Thank you for your e-mail of the 20th October. I apologise for the slow reply but I was travelling when it was received at the gallery. I now have 'pointillist' colour works by Cross and Signac which might be of interest to you. Both are from the collection of one of my clients. The Signac is similar to the work that you liked on the website. The details are: Paul Signac Le Soir - Evening Jetty at Flessingue Original lithograph in five colours. 1898. From the issued edition, commissioned and issued by Meier Graefe for the album 'Pan', Berlin 1898. Drawn and printed at the studio of Clot, Paris 1897/98.

Image: 8 x 10 3/8ins. o2500 (US$ 3750) There is no illustration of the Cross on the website. If you do not know the image then we could arrange for a printout in colours to be sent to you by Fedex (we do not currently have scan available for e-mail) but we would need your full mailing address. The details are as follows: Henri Edmond Cross - In the Champs Elysees. Les Nourrices. Original lithograph in colours. 1898. Numbered in pencil from the very scarce de-luxe edition of 75 impressions. Prior to the regular issued edition for the album. Commissioned and issued by Meier Graefe for 'Pan, Berlin 1898. Drawn and printed at the studio of Clot, Paris 1897/98. Exceptionally fine fresh impression of the rare de-luxe edition. On china paper mounted on a japan backing sheet as issued. Full margins. excellent condition.

Mike, Is this something that you and Jeff are interested in doing for the EGM nominees?  The list Brian attached below for Frevert includes only ENA employees.  Just let me know if I can do something to help. Thanks, Billy 
Dave/Mark: I have attached a list of the ENA/EGM/EIM employees nominated for the Chairman's Award.   Mark, could you send them a brief personal congratulations email? Thanks, Brian 
Mark, FYI, here is the latest update on our Q4.  We are making headway and the list shows how we intend to make up the short fall.  As I stated on my voicemail yesterday, upon our return from the holiday,  I will be even more proactively managing the Q4 P&L. Have a great holiday. mike 
Latest 4th Qtr. earnings outlook with changes from last week noted.  Call me if you have any questions. 
Jim, Thank you so much for all your help on this matter.  I know how difficult your job is day to day without items like this popping up.  I spoke with Carol Randall and Cindy Levi, the principal of the school, and they are so appreciative it is hard to describe it.  The school constantly talks about Enron and hundreds of children are using the donated computers and now printers. Thanks again and have a good holiday. Sincerely, Mike McConnell 
All, Below is a resume of Manuel.  I met with him and has a good background and is a superior performer.  He is willing to locate from Manilla and would go to Sydney and Tokyo.  Interesting origination oppt. Mike List

Jeff, FYI, good summary email. As we get bids for Project Jose, we should keep him informed but move forward with getting the competitive bids. mike 
Several developers in your groups have asked questions recently concerning the future of EECC and whether EECC would be there for them in the planning process for future Enron turnkeys.  Some of these turnkeys, like Venezuela LNG, we are currently working on but there's some uncertainty in their minds whether or not we'll be allowed to do the project.  Let me clarify the current situation. Lou Pai and I have briefed Jeff Skilling as part of the 2001 budget process and obtained his approval for EECC to continue with the following role: EECC will manage Enron's technical and engineering risk for large asset construction projects.  EECC can perform the Enron turnkeys when we mutually agree that we have the market price and schedule. EECC will shut down third party work (not related to Enron projects except for NEPCO and power projects). EECC will leverage its approach to technical engineering and construction risk management to develop new products and services, for example, lender's engineering due diligence, etc. EECC will develop an Enron Construction Risk Book for all Enron projects, including NEPCO.  (This process is underway with the help of Rick Buy's group and should be completed by mid-December.) EECC will transition NEPCO into our project power company.  I'm beginning this transition by moving the Enron Brazil projects and their project teams under the NEPCO umbrella.  However, NEPCO cannot manage the Arcos project in Spain, which has already begun engineering, and I will grandfather Arcos (and probably the second project in Spain) inside EECC. As before, business units can bid for outside prices and schedules.  I think in that regard nothing has changed.  I would like to continue working with your teams to continue looking for the best deal for Enron on every project, whether that's an EECC/NEPCO EPC or an outside EPC.  I think we expect to manage the outside contractors when a decision is made that the best choice for a particular project is a third party contractor.  I would like to follow up and meet with you in due course to answer any other questions. LI49700 
Lisa, Thanks for the email and invitation.  I am out and will be unable to attend. Thanks, mike Lisa Yoho@EES 11/15/2000 10:33 AM 
Wendy Gramm invited Jeff Skilling to attend a social event for Senator Lugar (R-IN) in Dallas on Sunday, November 19th.   Jeff is going to be out of town, so I wanted to know if you are interested in attending on Enron's behalf? I'm told it's going to be a small gathering of CEOs from Texas companies. Senator Lugar is the Chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over the Commodities Exchange Act legislation.   Lugar is a senior player on ag issues, and will be very influential in the farm policy debate -- which begins anew next year.    He's also involved in foreign relations issues, and is pro-trade. Let me know if you're interested (and available) to attend this event, and I will get additional details to you asap. Thank you. Lisa Yoho Government Affairs X5-3837

Mike, We met back in the early summer and made a presentation to you, Steve Horn, and Allan Sommer regarding SeaLogistics.  Since that time, we have completed a merger with one of our primary competitors, launched our bulk shipping/e-chartering exchange and now have begun trading on the site.  We currently have support from charterers representing approximately 10% of the global petroleum shipping spot market volume and from ship owners representing approximately 15% of the large tanker fleet. I saw that Enron announced last month its entry into the freight futures market for bulk petroleum shipping.  Given this event and our marketplace momentum, I thought it may make sense to have a more strategic discussion around possible opportunities between Enron and SeaLogistics. Please let me know your interest in discussing further a potential joint opportunity. Best regards, Brad W. Brad Browning Chief Executive Officer Phone: 713.751.3000 e-mail: brad.browning@sealogistics.com SeaLogistics Open Seas  Open Market TM

Mike: I enjoyed your remarks and meeting you after your speech.  I remain quite interested in your comment that Enrononline expects to trade more coal that natural gas or electricity in the future. As we discussed, we are the dominant software fossil fuel developers in the generating space, having our operating systems installed in 23 of the largest generating companies.  The largest of our customers are also the largest consumers of coal, and include TVA, Southern, AEP, First Energy, CP&L, Exelon, New Century/Excel, and Southern Energy, among others.  At several of the companies' request, we have developed our Fuel Optimizer Module (FPO), which tells the fuel buyer what the delivered cost to a plant specific specifications is, once the coal cost is factored into the equation. Attached is an overview of our system, and the specs on the FPO.  Please forward these on the appropriate people in your organization.  I look forward to hearing from them. Thank you for your time.

I am sending the message again with only one attachment and then will follow-up by sending the remaining two presentations under separate messages due to the size of each of the files. Sorry for the delay. 
Ahmad, Thank you for the email.  I enjoyed our visit very much.  I wanted to thank you for taking the time especially during your weekend to spend time away from your family.  I learned a lot during the trip and I believe in the Dolphin project.  I also liked many other of the project Rick's team has put together in the Middle East.

Please pass along to Kathie and Michelle the name of a contact person in your group that will be responsible for providing updates for the weekly newsletter.  Kathie has assured me that the person providing the information is not required to do the actual writing, but provide bullet points which she will then prepare in paragraph form.

Jannell grabbed me today to ask where we stand as I think she still has an interest in coming to our group. I asked her if she had been contacted by anyone in power marketing and she has not. Could you have Janet talk to her so we can either move forward or move on. thanks.

Mike: Many thanks for all of the support in the placement of the former CALME employees.  We are done to just a very few at this time. It appears that your new squad is getting some traction on building the LNG business.  I'm pleased to hear that. I look forward to hearing how our transportation or logistics business is developing.  Perhaps we can get together sometime during the San Antonio conference to catch up. All the best.  Shawn PS.  the following is an interesting article about the online intermodal landscape.

'Dot-coms' explain how they hope to compete in intermodal market and among themselves With some 150 websites devoted to transportation, e-commerce companies acknowledge that it's difficult for potential customers to cut through the confusion and figure out who's doing what and who's going to be with them for the long term. Because of the competition between their respective railroad partners, one of the bigger questions for intermodal shippers is the relationship between Arzoon and Freightwise. There has been speculation that after Freightwise was established by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, four competitors -- Union Pacific Railroad, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway -- teamed up with rival e-commerce site Arzoon in a response to BNSF's proposed merger with Canadian National Railway. However, both Freightwise and Arzoon claim that's not the case. ""I'm continually asked, 'What's up with the four railroads and Arzoon?'"" said Charley Eisele, UP senior vice president, strategic planning.

John, Thanks for the email.  I enjoyed my visit to the middle east and our discussion.  I really appreciate your insight.  I am very committed to the project and many of the other opportunities that Rick's team has put together. I'll see you in the new year. Sincerely,

Joe, I think the entire event was outstanding.  I also enjoyed it but my hand still hurts!  Ken went through it today at the executive committee and he talked about the incredible potential and the job you were doing. Congratulations again, mike PS Weekly calls are a favorite of mine as you know. Joseph P Hirl@ENRON 11/02/2000 07:16 PM 
Mike, Certainly appreciate you visiting the office and helping with the opening... not the least shaking over 300 hands and breaking the barrell.  Sorry we were not able to spend some time discussing business.  We did get some good time with Jeff on Wednesday.  I understand we will now be on a weekly call. Ken seemed to be satisfied with the opening.  His visit has done quite a lot for us. thanks, Joe 
Mike I will pledge 500 usd to JD and I am also pledging an additional 200 usd to Joyce down on our floor. I know this is an important cause to you and sincerely hope that your efforts and those of others succeeds in finding the cure. 
We did fall apart in baseball this year.  We are not a 1 sport team we are the sport team.  Football is just a tad more important then the others.

Mike - I enjoyed your presentation  and comments about Enron Global Markets last week. Your comment about being passionate about things which add value to the company is important for success at Enron was very helpful. I am an originator in EIM for our pulp & paper businesses. I am starting business development effort in Asia for Pulp & Paper which I am very excited about. I will be in Asia visiting potential consumers and producers in major countries in Asia e.g., Japan, India, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Australia and others. I would like to know if you recommend someone in Enron offices in these countries who may have originated businesses with major pulp & paper clients for other products e.g., energy or other commodities. Thanks for your help in advance. 
Thought you might enjoy the past and present 
Cool! 
Christine, I so rarely write love notes.  17 years ago it was common place, even a daily event.  What happened to that guy?  I could have been a cartoonist in another life. I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying  by China, soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.  You said something very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the airport.  You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by yourself.  I can certainly understand that.  I seem to have a l lot of that on this trip.  I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out trick or treating.  I bet they look great. As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality and realize just how lucky we really are.  I turned to Ken Rice at the ceremony yesterday and said, ""What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House, breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV.  The Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is out of a job on a no confidence vote last night.  (Really bad luck for Enron here) I would have liked to have met him.  Actually, the ceremony was neat and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it.  You should see me in a Happy coat.  I'll explain when i get home. Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even imagining what are lives are like today?  We are so blessed.  Even more than that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and wondering why God let me find you so many years ago.  I must have been a priest in a former life. Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this airplane.  Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.  Although I am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the internet. I love you and miss you very much. Eternally, Michael See you soon and in time for soccer. xxxxxooooo 
Dear beautiful and majestic butterfly and wonerful wizard Harry Potter, How are you!!!!   Did you have a great time trick or treating?  I so wish I could have been there.  You know I wouldn't have missed it if I could have possibly been there.  Did Mommy take a lot of pictures?  I hope so.  I can't wait to see them. Will you show me what you looked like when I get home? I love you, Daddy 
Brent, I would like this to become formal policy within EGM as well. I know that it exists and is around but no one is familiar with this or exactly how it works.   We have made strides with credibility with RAC regarding coal and we are doing a better job of seeing deals in general but I would like to put out a policy like this for us.  Please take a look at this and draft a memo that can be sent out addressing the approval procedures and the guidelines and limits around them. Thanks, mike 
Yes, there is a formalized process.  After Credit and Legal, and in most cases RAC, look at transactions, a VP or higher will sign the Dash.  For Doug to sign the Bahamas option contract, I need to know the premium.  Please contact Brent Price for our DASH.  (Deal approval sheet) Jeff Merritt Thomas                10/23/2000 04:51 PM 
Jeff, I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I can't seem to get a straight answer from anyone - when one is signing a contract around here, is there a form you fill out for approval?  In London, everyone fills out a CACS form (Contract A uthorisation Control Sheet), and if the deal is > $0.5m, then a DASH is required as well.  Brad seems to think that if a DASH is not required, then the business unit head signs off on the expenditure?  Is there a formalised global-markets process for this, or is this a product-by-product thing?  (in which case, I'll assume LNG has no process, and I'll direct Eric to implement one...)  (Doug Arnell needs to purchase his option for the Bahamas land thing, thus the reason for the question). fyi, attached is European CACS form. Thanks, Merritt

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading exchange.? We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going quite well. However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration, as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Enron Global Markets. My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.? I have been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work. I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com. Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking and capital markets. Attached is a copy of my resume.? My goal is to procure a challenging leadership position within your group in the capacity of Business Developement, Corporate Finance, Mergers & Acquisition, or Venture Capital.? I would be open to other suggestions. Please review my resume when you get a chance.?

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication Mike Brown, David Terlip, Janice Moore and I met today.  Plan is for Mike to get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens. If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy. This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo ""off spec"" demand separate test using ""ashing"" technique (more likely to pass) and if it passes using ""ashing"" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute over acceptance of ""ashing"" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected (either because First Gas refuses to accept ""ashing"" or because off spec even with ""ashing"") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery. This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on spec. Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a status report. Please let me know if you have any questions. Cheers.  And congratulations on the Sooners' win.

Rick, While in Tokyo, Sanjay grabbed Jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking at the existing LNG fuel deals for Dabhol.  The bottom line is that he believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post phase 2 and if we could redo the LNG contracts and allow more flexibility we could help them, thus help ourselves.  We need to look into this and I would like your initial opinion.  This is complex to say the least and it would involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.  He believes that there is some flexibility in the shipping and Oman contracts to address these issues. If it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for transport.  Is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place? Lets discuss when I am in Dubai.  Sanjay is not going to let it go so you need to think about who can look into this further.

Cindy, I have a friend that is a principal in a company called Nexstar.  The company  is on a roll and offers an interesting product.  I have attached his email and basic presentation but I thought it was interesting enough to bring it up to you.  Also he is a friend and I don't want to ignore him.  Do we do anything like this with our employees? I would really appreciate some feedback on this.  Unless you think it is a total waist of time, I would appreciate you and some other appropriate members of your HR team to attend 1 intro. meeting to listen to their pitch. I would of course attend as well if you like.  They have an impressive customer list already. Let me know what you think and I'll help co-ordinate the meeting. Thanks, Mike 
Vance, I've been attempting to call you .  Your voicemail is full and my return voicemail keeps getting rejected.  I suggest you clear out some room. I would be happy to change my schedule and meet either at 12 or 12:30.  I don't really want an hour with him but will do what you need.

FYI m 
Guys, what do you think?  Any ideas or interest? m 
Mike: One of the things I wanted to discuss in our meeting was your advice on one of the CALME personnel for deployment, Antonio Jenkins Lara. He is a very solid candidate that I'm confident can add great value in Enron. Antonio has been a strong performer for us in his short stay with us.  He joined us around the middle of the year, so we did not have much data when we conducted our mid-year review. He is an entrepreneur with strengths in logistics and systems.  He has both technical and commercial backgrounds. During this year, he used is background in logistics and management to identify $1.8MM in recurring annual savings for Ventane, one of Enron's businesses in Venezuela. I had initially placed him with Dan Reck because of Antonio's background in logistics.  However, it appears that Dan is more interested in bringing on people with a background in trading, which is not Antonio's strength. I encourage you to closely examine his resume and I appreciate any good ideas. I'm also looking forward to getting together with you soon. Many thanks.  Shawn 
CP, Please send on and co-ordinate a 30 minute meeting with Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen for discussion.  They might be able to use him as well. Thanks, m

jim, i don't really have an opinion but i certainly won't get in your way on the approval. 
Maryfran, I would like to thank you for your very nice nomination.  As flattered as I am, I believe that our current Chief Technology Officer, Philippe Bibi, is more appropriate as a nominee from Enron.  I am very proud of our accomplishments when I was responsible as CEO for Enron's Global Technology group but my tenor was only about a year.  In August I was asked to take on another assignment as CEO of Enron Global Markets.  Although this was an even more challenging position I will say that it was a tough decision to leave the technology world. Philippe Bibi has driven our technology group for many years and deserves a great deal of the credit for Enron's recognized technology advantage and innovation.  He has been in the tech business for about 17 years. Sincerely, Mike S. McConnell Premier100@Computerworld.com on 10/20/2000 09:13:50 AM

Rick, I am scheduled to be out on vacation but I think you should have the meeting if it still fits peoples schedules.  I am doubtful but will look at later. m Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/25/2000 03:45 AM 
Mike/Jeff: Each year at about this time I hold an LNG Offsite meeting to review the progress of the year and to set direction for the next year.  This year's offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech. Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual. I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day. This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on ""mark to market"" mechanics, the LNG ""book"", enron online and any other similar topics that may be appropriate.  To that end, we are working on the following agenda: Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:  Mick Mcconnell/Jeff Shankman LNG organization and strategic objectives:  Rick Bergsieker/Eric Gonzales LNG risk book:     Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch?? Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brad Hitch Mark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brent Price 2000 review/objectives for 2001: Eastern Hemisphere:  Clay Harris Atlantic Basin:  Doug Arnell/Emilio Vicens Shipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne Perry Legal:  Dan Rogers Several questions: Mike/Jeff:  would either or both of you be available to participate,at least for an hour or so to get us started? Eric:  can you be there at least for Monday? Jeff:  have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations? Brent:  can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including key contractual provisions required)? FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements for this offsite. Rick 
This is the proposed invite list to the LNG offsite that has been scheduled for the Woodlands on Monday, Nov. 20. Please send me the names of any additions you suggest. I would like to get out a note to people on this ASAP. We plan an all day meeting on Monday and Golf, etc for those that want to do so on Tuesday. That way those that need to travel or work are only tied down one day. I would also appreciate any agenda ideas you may want to include. Thanks Wayne

Jay, thanks for the donation and commitment.  the check should be made out to JDF.  We'll do all the matching. Hope all is well. mike Jay Fitzgerald 10/24/2000 10:44 AM 
Mike- I received your letter about the JDF just last week, although it was dated September 29th.  I would be proud to donate to this cause.  I have commited $200 to others for this already, so I will commit $300 to you.  I appreciate all of your help with my various fundraising activities, and am happy to help with yours. All the best, Jay 
Cool.  Thanks for sharing that with me. m

Sunday, November 5th, is the big day.  Although we have less than two weeks left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place. All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the following activities this week: Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480. Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October 27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the purchase of raffle tickets at the same location. For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make you feel great.  This is a world class event. Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join the fun. Steering Committee Members: Blanca Bollom  X66091 Deb Gebhardt  X39606 John Godbold  X30623 Cathy Phillips  X36898 Debbie Yates  X35305 Thank you very much for your support and generosity.

Dear Mike: I apologize for my tardy response to the JDF Fund-raiser.  The letter went to my old office at EnergyEcomm.com.  Unfortunately, that office has closed, and it took a bit of time for the mail service to forward the letter. 
Gary, 1.  Correct 2.  Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for all of it's employees.  Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year. The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance.  It is a very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent performance.  The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous sources.  It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver. Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC. 3.  I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the process as well as our group looking at it the same way.  An example would be that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest and greatest technology.  and could look at embedding a new system in the company because it is the latest technology and is very cool.   I would ask what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a competitive advantage.  It was a very customer driven (internal and external customers) process.  It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the bottom line rather than simply a cost center. I hope that helps. Sincerely, Mike ""Gary Anthes"" <Gary_Anthes@computerworld.com> on 10/24/2000 03:09:48 PM 
Hi Mike, three more questions. I hope I'm not wearing out my welcome. 1. Is Philippe Bibi spelled correctly? 2. You said, ""When it came to the review process itself, Global Technology ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated."" I may not have gotten this down correctly, but I don't quite understand it. Are you saying that IT basically just lists the people but the business units actually rate them? 3. When you refer to taking a ""commercial"" view of technology, what do you mean exactly and how is that new? Thanks again. Regards, Gary Anthes Gary H.

Jeff, Sorry for the slow response. I don't have a strong opinion either way.  I am fine with the combo idea. In the future, please let me know if something has a short fuse.  I am still slower on email but I do respond very quickly to voicemail.  I am almost caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and best way to communcate. Thanks, 
Jeff, Let me know what you think of this guy.  Wade Cline and Tim Det. are both high on him.  Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday. During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.  I think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get a part time guy in the process.  He could also report to us obviously (like Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.  What do you think? If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.  I thought he was all right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an innovative thinker.  He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus. 
Jeff, I like the memo and I'll keep my ears open for feedback.  Your presence is needed more than I thought.  My gut told me that they really needed your help but its more than that.  Taking contol of that P&L is the highest return of your time and talent for EGM and for Enron, atleast for this quarter.  They will learn or they will be out.

What ever happended to the saying "" the more things change, the more they remain the same""?  Things have definitely not stayed the same. Anyway, Dorothy asked about you and I encouraged her to call you, and I think she will. JMoore 
Guys, Attached below is a presentation that I put together for M Frevert for the latest analyst presentation.  We kept it to only a few businesses -  they didn't end up using any of it.

Don't worry about power point, simply the dot points that you want on the page. Thanks, mike

Warmest regards, Virginia Repasky Christopher-Clark Fine Art 
Doug, Last week, you referenced that there are a lot of deals that come up during the day for various regions and companies around Enron that your group doesn't get any monetary recognition for but that they need to be done or are provided as a service to save money. By the way, saving money is real money to Enron.   Would you please provide me with some examples of that so I can put it in context? Thanks, 
Jim, I think it does.  I am usually unable to attend so I would really like you to stick with this as our rep.  Also we will talk about the best uses of your time after this weeks budget meetings.  I'll give you a call. Thanks, Mike James C Lewis@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/12/2000 04:22 PM

Erin, here are a couple of responses.  Please rewrite as you see fit. Mike 1. Agriculture.    We are currently looking at and studying the industry.  We have traded some commodities as well.  We believe that there may be large opportunities to apply the Enron model to the agriculture industry.  We have spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our strategy.  This is very early in development but we have high expectations in this area.  I don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time. Gary Hickerson is responsible Enron's ag business. 2.  Rail.  We are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and transportation businesses.  I haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of rail.  It is an interesting concept and one that we will look at.   Dan Reck is now responsible for looking at transportation opportunities in the US. 10/10/2000 09:08 AM Erin Rice@ENRON Erin Rice@ENRON Erin Rice@ENRON 10/10/2000 09:08 AM 10/10/2000 09:08 AM 
Mike, have you had a chance to look at the questions below?  I'd like to post the responses while the meeting is still fresh in everyone's mind. Thanks. - er 
Mike: The following questions were asked but not addressed in today's all-employee meeting (no, they'renot about your wardrobe this time).  Would you please respond?  I will route to Ken, Jeff and Joe for approval, then post the questions and answers in eMeet. Thanks for your help. - Erin (Internal Communications) What is our strategy/plan in agricultural commodities trading? Energy opportunity:  Have you thought about supplying electricity to railtrack for its EC4T (Electric Current for Traction), i.e. all its traction power (overhead power lines and 3rd rail system).

Ron, Hello.  I am back in the country -  I've been out for 2 weeks since I picked up the car.  I am very happy with the car and your contact treated me very well.  The transaction went smoothly and they worked with me to get the car before I went off to Asia. I wanted to thank you again for all your help and efforts.   I have had many comments already and there is not doubt that this will lead to a new wave of Enron purchases of Mercedes. I am a Mercedes believer. Sincerely, 
Virginia, Thanks for the email.  I apologize for the slow response.  Life is crazy and I have been back on the road again. I am interested in purchasing ""Blue Note"" and I understand that the price is $4,500 framed as before.  I am chasing down another piece, as i think i have stated before, but have not closed yet on it.  It is significantly less but I have not closed the deal.  I would like to own the piece.  Do you think there is any room on the price from your seller?  I will commit to you but I can't leave a couple of thousand dollars on the table because of my impatience. That being said, i do want it and this one is found and ready to go.  I will commit today to purchase the picture in this condition for $3,500.  you can tell the seller that I will commit with American Express immediately at that price.  I don't know if that works for you or the seller. Please let me know what you think.  I am in this week. Thanks and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  I am ready to make a decision. Mike ""Virginia E. Repasky"" <virginia@clarkfineart.com> on 10/03/2000 02:31:55 PM Please respond to virginia@clarkfineart.com

George, Attached for your review and commentary is a copy of a first draft of a presentation that i am creating on EGM.  This is for an upcoming analyst presentation and for our ongoing use.  Please review and make any comments you feel are needed.  Especially focus on coal which is on page 5.  Please take a quick look and return your initial comments quickly.  I need to get out a new and better draft ASAP.  Also, how do we illustrate your business graphically.  Please decide, fill in and I'll have our graphics guy make it look pretty. Thanks, mike 
Rick, Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am putting together for EGM.  I would appreciate your comments on the presentation but especially need your input on your section.  The LNG page is on page 6 and needs some work.  there is also a typo.  On the graph, we need to find a way to illustrate our business graphically, what do you think? I would appreciate a quick turnaround of your initial changes.  After we complete this first draft, this will be a continuous work in progress. Thanks, Mike 
Thanks.

Mike Hi. I hope everything is going well at your end. I would like to announce some good news. I have decided to get married at the year end on Saturday, 2nd December to be precise. The lucky or should it be foolhardy ladies name is Jaya. I would like to extend an invite to you and your family, a formal invite will follow in the post. I hope you are able to attend even if it means combining it with a business trip to this region. (December climate wise is the best time of year and the Taj Mahal is very romantic place and being one of the seven wonders of the world worth a visit). Good wishes to your family. Regards Sunil 
Thor, A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank you for all your effort. I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to discuss some of the ideas you presented. 
Gary, There were two such events.  On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on technology.  None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.  It inspired me to keep going on a ""nontraditional"" path.  The other big  impact moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of Cisco.  It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, ""its a matter of survival"" speech.  That really hit me and our conversation was also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.  He gave me a positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron in the eCommerce world.  It was going to take a different kind of technologist.  That moment had the most impact on me of the two.   I saw John again and spoke with him at an Economist  conference in Laguna Nigel and told him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.  He also was very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well. I hope that clarified things,  good luck with the piece. Thanks, mike ""Gary Anthes"" <Gary_Anthes@computerworld.com> on 10/09/2000 02:06:52 PM 
Hi Mike, just one more: You said, in describing the Sun breakfast, ""I'll never forget this; this had a huge impact on the way I ran that group for the next year."" What did you mean by that?

Mike - I wanted to follow up with you regarding Billy Lemmons.  As you know, both myself and Gary have spoken to Billy about an opportunity in the Ag effort.  I think Billy could help us pursue the origination opportunities we discussed on Wednesday and help us develop many more.  In addition to the tremendous experience he would bring to our team, he seems genuinely interested and excited about the opportunity. I know you and Billy have discussed the Ag effort and I wanted to know if you felt this would be the right move for Billy at this time.  Certainly, it is his decision but I believe he is looking to you for EGM's committment to Agriculture. Please let me know if I can answer any questions you may have. Thanks,  Elsa Piekielniak (37613) 
Gary, Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it helps. 1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant feedback.  It was vitally important for the ""customer"" to be happy and that the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated. 2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing around the world. Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the next level that are IT executives. 3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the world.  He chuckled and said something like, ""That sounds like Enron, it always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize it and change its culture"". 4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that. Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions. Mike ""Gary Anthes"" <Gary_Anthes@computerworld.com> on 10/06/2000 04:18:40 PM 
Hello Mike, Thanks for sending me those presentation slides. They are good background. And thanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most interesting and helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering a few more questions? 1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you ""seeded people out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had those people be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head."" So, at that point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersed thoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT organization for things such as standards, is that correct? 2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,500 IT people essentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT organization? Roughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two of the three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does any given IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT and to a business unit? 3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you said about Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast. Could you repeat that? 4. You said: ""We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'll 
Charlene, Thanks for the email.  I have talked with Sally several times on this last= =20 couple of days and I understand that OU has a different recruiting schedule= =20 then other schools.  Enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future a= nd=20 I have asked Sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on th= at=20 trip.  I believe that she has been able to schedule this so I believe that= =20 from an OU perspective it may be a mute point now.  Doing that should be ab= le=20 to maintain the momentum that we have developed at OU and all the work Lexi= =20 has done.  By the way, the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very= =20 successful. If you have any other questions or comments please let me know. mike Charlene Jackson@ENRON 10/05/2000 06:34 AM 
Sally, Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and= =20 Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis= h=20 that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin= g=20 difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was= =20 available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any= =20 member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to= =20 explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set = it. You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20 permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As= =20 you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting= =20 firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark= et=20 research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20 required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20 shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10= =20 years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm= s,=20 begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20 actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns= =20 until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,= =20 Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first= =20 year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui= t=20 in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for= =20 ""spring"" internships. The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last= =20 year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &= =20 February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that= =20 did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope= . =20 We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20 because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms. Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s= ummer=20 interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and= =20 40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20 summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20 assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20 offers to join Enron.  =20 The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20 summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20 undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20 particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms= =20 that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20 undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20 continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the= re=20 were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs). With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about= =20 which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y= ou=20 indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve= r,=20 provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken= =20 therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU. While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained= =20 from UT. o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20 o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on= =20 campus conduct interviews in the fall for ""summer"" internships.  Cindy=20 attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring= ,=20 or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct= =20 all interviews  at one time. =20 o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting = on=20 campus recruit in the spring for summer internships. We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t= he=20 statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such= =20 information. =20 It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20 different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20 individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for= =20 the discrepancies. While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20 different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie= ve=20 that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20 supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20 already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview= =20 process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in= =20 most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by= =20 the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would= =20 like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this= =20 fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to= =20 support your efforts. I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20 frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20 manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i= f=20 you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20 Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20 interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance. Charlene

Steve - Can you please give Michael Brown, Mike McConnell and me an update on this. John 
The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti cargoes direct to the third parties) . Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in the early 2000. As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name (and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk that a Spanish liquidator contest our position. We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and stop payments... GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for.. We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company cannot get sold. Thanks Michel 
Howdy from Tokyo.  Brutal trip.  Thanks for your follow-up 
Sally, Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines. Please keep me up informed on this matter. Thanks and good luck with the students. mike Enron North America Corp.

thanks, i like the letter. 
Rick, Obviously we want to control access to the LNG terminal.  I don't really understand why it is so difficult if we go to 50%, its a negotiation item. Or at least a cheap retention option not to be given away for free. After your follow-up meetings, please let me know if we need to get more involved. m Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/30/2000 12:07 PM 
Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling this terminal We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any thoughts or suggestions Rick 
Carol, Thanks for the email.  Please send it to the office upon your receipt.  On the coat, I don't have time to think about it now.  Thanks for bringing it to my attention. 
Joe, I enjoyed it as well.  We all have a lot to do and money to make!  I got a long voicemail back from K Lay on my message to him and he heard me on the ePower side.  He also said that he had heard similar concerns as well. Rick Bergseiker (LNG) will be calling you.  He left me a voicemail that he has been working with ePower quite a bit and has talked about 2 LNG facilities.  i told him to work with you. Cheers, mike Joseph P Hirl@ENRON 10/02/2000 03:18 AM

Carol, I brought in a check this morning for $250 for JDF.  Can you help me set up the Enron match and then contact a coordinator so that we can show our support. Mike, Thanks for you sponsorship of this effort! 
It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself. Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it. If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.

Don, Howdy from Tokyo.  Thanks for the email.  It was great hearing from you.  I would be happy to talk with you in Dallas about your business. In the mean time, why don't you send me a new email (without the personal stuff) about your company and references to your website and i will forward it to the appropriate people within Enron with a note to insure that it gets the proper attention. Thanks and see you soon. Mike ""Daniel, Don"" <ddaniel@nexstarhome.com> on 09/28/2000 09:59:11 AM 
Hey Mike, It's been a long time since we last spoke, hope all is well with you and the family in Houston. I saw Jonny & Brenda in Telluride this weekend and he mentioned we would be getting together in Dallas. It will be great to see yall again.  It's already that time of year for the big shoot-out when the Horns tangle with the Sooners. It looks like this could be another very interesting game, no telling what will happen with the way both teams are playing this year. I have been thinking of you and I had planned to call you to talk a little business. Our company, Nexstar  is now up and running and working with major corporations like Enron to provide mortgage loans to their relocating employees and as a benefit to the general employment base. We are a high tech , high touch approach to mortgage lending providing employees with internet and/or telephony interaction with Nexstar. As a follow-up to our discussion in the bar last year in Dallas, I thought we could chat about what's going on in the financial services industry and if Nexstar's products and services could be of any benefit to Enron. If you have any interest you can view our website at nexstarhome.com. Please drop me a note or give me a call so we can catch up and even talk a little business. I also wanted to talk about that ballpark with your name on it. I have not had a chance to see it yet but plan to when I get down to Houston. Take care, and don't forget to HOOK-EM  Horns! Don 
Beverly, Wow!  Fantastic.  Thanks for sharing your success and letter. mike 
I wanted to give you an update on my progress in EES with the JDF - - - -as of this afternoon, I have collected (with Enron matching) $4,600. This is the letter I sent to my solicitation list last week - .....  Pretty good for one week, right? Good afternoon. My 17 year old son has had diabetes since he was 2 years old.  Imagine this - as of today, Austin has taken more than 16,425 shots and more than 27,300 finger sticks.  It never gets easier for him and it will never go away until a cure is found.   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult blindness and non-traumatic amputations, a leading cause of nerve damage, heart attack and stroke.  Until a cure is found, his health is better today than it will be tomorrow. Please let me know if I can count on you to walk with me or help raise funds for Juvenile Diabetes.  84% of the money raised goes directly to diabetes research.   My commitment to you is this - walk with me - I guarantee you a morning of fun, good times and the opportunity to meet a large, dynamic group of people committed to finding a cure.  Sponsor me - you will help millions of kids like mine that are desperately looking for a cure. The walk is on Sunday, November 5, 9:00 AM - 4.5 miles at Sam Houston Race Park.   If you cannot join in the walk but want to help monetarily, please send your check payable to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) to my attention - 1400 Smith Street, EB 760 / Houston, Tx 77002. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.    My son and millions of other kids with diabetes thank you as well. 
Virginia, Thanks for the update.  I will not have an opportunity to talk with you right now.  I am in Tokyo and my next destination may change due to business events in the middle east. I am very interested in acquiring Blue note, however,  I do want to know more about the price.  I was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay for a lot less.  Also, your price was $4,500 for the same piece framed.  Is there room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.  The ebay price is significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet either.  If you can't get them down on the price,  it is worth me chasing down the other option for a while. Please let me know via email and I will attempt to be responsive via odd time zones. Thanks, mike ""Virginia E.

Dear Mike: Glad to hear from you. The Lichtenstein ""Composition No. 4"" is exactly like the one you saw except that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition.  The price is $4,500.00.  That is unframed.  We can frame the artwork like the Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.  You have that option. I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail. The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited. I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse ""Icarus"" artwork. When would be the best time to contact you and Chris? As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily replaced.  Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working with clients and galleries to place this artwork.  I mention this only to encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork to your collection. I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.

FYI, project Dragon.  It looks like it is done.  i replied that we understood and it was fine. m 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels - At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns. Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2. Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco. The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates. The following is a summary of these competition provisions: Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk management services. There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction. ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix). ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii). It does not include Japan and Australia. The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003. Thank you, 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region 
Thanks, understood and good luck. 
Cool, This is a big deal and a deal we should highlight as an example of our vision of the future.  Congratulate the team. m Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/25/2000 11:04 AM 
FYI, the ""Hanjin Muscat""  sucessfully delivered our Oman spot cargo at Lake Charles and departed without incident on the evening of 24 September Because of the high price differential (ENA bought the LNG from us at $4.23 Henry Hub price) we drew down on the LNG heel and thus discharged more LNG than ENA had committed to buy.  By doing this, we picked up perhaps an additional $50 thousand of income in excess of what was originally intended. I expect that our total net income from this cargo will be about $175 thousand 
congrats.  see you next year. 
Thanks I know they are meeting but didn;t specifically know about LNG.  I'll let you know lhow it comes out. m Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/25/2000 11:10 AM

Mark, Attached is the information you requested for your presentation to the analysts.  I didn't know exactly what you were looking for, so I listed out a lengthy laundry list of facts and philosophies for each group for you to pick and choose what information and style that you wanted.  I didn't attempt to put this in a final set of dot points.  I realize that this is a lot more than what you wanted but I didn't know your other pieces or what was needed to be consistent with the other sections of the presentation. I hope this is what you were looking for and i apologize for the delay.  If you want anything else or more specific types of other information, please let me know via email or preferably via voicemail in Houston.  I'll be Singapore until Wed. evening when I arrive in Toyko.  I am 13 hours ahead of Houston time. Thanks and have a good trip.  Let me know if you want me to look at a draft copy. Mike PS;  good luck with Eric ""boy do i want to be in LNG"" Gonzelas 
Jeff, I don't know if you got this.  What do you think?  Interesting background and info for Net Works or our moving into the Chemical business. mike 
John, I just realized that I didn't return your call on Friday.  I ran out of the office on Friday after two difficult days and had Cathy collect all my stuff for my trip.  Jeff and I landed in Singapore last night at 1am (it is odd leaving for the airport on Sat. morning and arriving on Monday morning) and are in the office for a while this afternoon.  I'll give you a call a little bit later.  If your call is urgent, please don't hesitate to give me a voicemail if our time zones don't match up. Thanks and sorry for the delay. 
Robert, Attached is the draft review for Steve.  Please review and make changes/corrections as you believe are necessary.  I could use the help, this is a tough one.

Thor, I'm out of town again and will calll you another time.  I plan on bringing the plan  on my Asia trip which begins on Sat.  Both Jeff and I will read it then and provide comments. Thanks, 
Joe, Stan Horton has been invited to attend a series of meetings associated with INGAA in Tokyo.  I believe that Stan is the Chairman of INGAA.  There are some Tokyo companies that are a part of the organization.  Bill Smith, CEO of Sonat (now El Paso) and will be talking about LNG and Japanese requirements and will be going to Tokyo.  Stan has asked both Sherriff and me if this is worth his attendance.  I thought you would be the best answer to that.  I also told him that you could represent Enron very well in any meeting in Japan. Please call Stan at 713 853 6177 and discuss with him.  He can fill you in better on the details.  Your call. Thanks, mike

George, I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29 credits.  This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will have approval issues with RAC and others.  I want Jeff and/or I in the meeting. Thanks,

no thank you not at this time. 
Vanessa, Thanks for the note.  I'll check out the book but I don't think I'll stop my insulin! mike Vanessa Kyama@ENRON 09/11/2000 08:22 AM 
Hi Mike, I don't know if you'll appreciate the following info, but there is a book called ""The Cure For All Diseases"" by Hulda Clark. She outlines how to cure diabetes so there is no need to take insulin.  It worked for my hypoglycemia, and a lot of other things. Vanessa 
Lacye, Thank you for your note and help!  I look forward to seeing you at the walk. mike Lacye Brymer@ENRON 09/11/2000 07:51 AM 
I do not know you but I work for Brian Redmond.  I am on Kathy Benedict's team and am happy to tell you that I have already received pledges for over $500.  I do not see this function as a competition, only as a wonderful opportunity to help so many people fight a disease that touches too many lives.  I have not worked for Enron for very long but I am happy to know that we have been #1 for 5 years!!  I hope that I can help to keep it that way again!!  I think that what you are doing is so great and I just felt like telling you!  Hope to meet you at the walk!! Sincerely, Lacye Brymer Trevino 
Wanda, Thanks for your story and support.  We will have great event again this year.  Let me know if there is anything I can do with your business unit to help you. Mike Wanda Chalk@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/11/2000 09:04 AM 
Mike: You can certainly count on my support.  My son Brandon Johnson was diagnosis with JD when he was 11 years old.  Needless to say my family was traumatised by the event, however my son handled it like a trooper.  He is now 16 years old and has very good days with his blood sugar, but then he has his bad ones as well.  I have walked since he was first diagnosed with JD and will continue to provide my support. Thx Wanda 
It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself. Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it. If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week. Thank you very much for your support.

Great, m Enron North America Corp. 
Dan, Fred has not had much luck with getting attention with this.  This sounds like it should be in your (new) group.  Please give Fred a call, I think this sounds very interesting and is worth a follow-up. Mike 
Congrats to all.  Jeff and I believe that EOL is a vital part of growing our businesses and your focus is appreciated. mike 
Nice job, John.  Keep the volumes and information flows growing - $$$ will follow. George John Massey 09/01/2000 01:50 PM 
August EOL EmissionsTrades exceeded projections and posted another record trade month. We continue to show signs of strong trade growth and gaining market share. I am hopeful that Arizona Public Service & Conectiv will use the system more heavily in the future (hedge option trades) and that we can obtain at least one new counterparty a month vis-.-vis EOL marketing/and or our own internal marketing.  Our gain in market share has not gone unchallenged. Bloombergs Powermatch system has been more active in the last month and bid/ask spreads continue to narrow. To combat this we continue to show (90% of the time) the tightest markets and obviously offer a cost advantage over the Broker market & Bloomberg.   The increase in EOL volume has increased liquidity in the whole market.  I am hopeful that overall market volumes continue to grow as we get closer to compliance. Number of Trades: 77 Number of Allowances: 192,500 Approx. Notional Trade Value: $28,875,000 
Ron, Thanks for the great news.  Also thanks so much for the gifts that I just received.  I wrote you a separate note on Friday, but I wanted to thank you again. The car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very pleasant distraction. I am gathering information on my BMW so that I can sell that to the dealership at the same time I pick up my new car.  I will have all my lease information with me.  I have a few months left on the lease and will have all the needed information to complete the transaction.  If you would, please forward this to or let me know who I should deal with at the North side dealership.  I don't want another Bob Brooks situation to occur.  Also I don't want him dealing with the purchase of my BMW since I believe he is in that part of the dealership now.   I expect a fair price for my car and with our history, I don't want him involved in pricing my car.  I am confident that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal with my cash purchase for the CL.  I guess I just need a name at the dealership. Thanks, mike ""Ron Shangle"" <SHANGLE@mbusa.com> on 09/08/2000 12:05:13 PM 
FYI, I've had a meeting with oxley on this. m 
David: As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel. We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people. Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list. The enclosed list indicates the current proposed ""New Roles"" for each of the Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees among: Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to complete) Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals LNG/Middle East to go to EGM Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses) EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain technical/operations people) The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to ensure that no individual falls through the cracks. The column ""Calme"" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and you may wish to ignore it. Please give me a call if you have any questions. Shawn 
Gary, Thanks and good luck.  Be sure and thank your wife for me for all her efforts. 
Thor, I've been out and forgot to call you back.  sorry for that.  I'll take a look at the plan when it comes in and if there is some other information that Jeff or I want to see, we'll let you know. Thanks, m Thor Lien 09/08/2000 02:53 AM 
Mike I'm running a bit late on the Bplan Is it soon enough for you to get it on Monday Thor 
Mark, The bigger issue is what are we going to do with EE&CC.  If their time is coming and we need to split them up then I would agree with this but otherwise I am not sure this is the best thing to do.  I have had very little actual work with EE&CC in the past year and can't really comment on their effectiveness. mike 
Larry: This fundamentally changes the entire basis of our approach to EECC and the way that the engineering organization works. The idea was that the engineering expertise resides in EECC.If u want to change that, it requires a broader discussion. Larry L Izzo 09/08/2000 04:37 PM 
In light of the lesson learned on Project Lightening and in view of the recent CALME reorganization, I suggest we simplify the payroll structure for Development Engineers (DE's).  Currently, the DE's listed below are still on EECC's payroll, although they are direct-line support to the Regions/Business Units.  I suggest that all DE's transfer from EECC's payroll to the Business Units they are supporting.  Some DE's are already on the regions' payrolls  I don't think this will have a budget impact, because at this time each region below is paying the total costs for these engineers, through EECC invoices. Please let me know if each of you agree and I will have HR do the payroll switch.

Stuart, A quick second follow up.  I talked again with Cindy Olson and she has discussed the issue in detail with the Astros organization.  They are going to think about this and examine for next season.  They did say that this was the first time this was brought up but they want to be sensitive and will consider at change. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

Fitzgerald 2115 Mount Forest Drive Kingwood, Texas 77345 281-361-6054 Mfitzgerald99@aol.com September 6, 2000 Dear Mr. McConnell: I have been referred to you by a neighbor of mine, George Fastuca. I have known George for approximately 18 months and when he heard I was looking to do differently he strongly suggested I contact you. I am searching for a position that will permit me to utilize the broad based business experience I have acquired in commercial and investment banking, industry and public accounting. Most recently, I was Vice President for American Electric Power Energy Services, a natural gas and electric power trading start up, responsible for business development. As Senior Vice President of Capital Markets at Chase Manhattan Bank, I launched an extremely successful derivative products/structured finance business in Texas and contiguous states. At Continental Bank, Citicorp and Motorola, Inc., I was responsible for a variety of innovative marketing and financial initiatives which included establishing new businesses, restructuring existing businesses and refinancing established or newly acquired businesses. Attached is a copy of my resume. Qualities which have contributed to my success are: ? Entrepreneurial. 3 of my last 4 positions were start ups or turnarounds. Experience with early stage ventures and acquisition identification. ? Partnership. Ability to build strong relationships by providing solid counsel and negotiating skills. Established and maintained excellent working relationships with other senior operating managers. ? General Management. Have held full P&L responsibilities. Established policies, programs and procedures to achieve growth objectives, including recruitment, evaluation and development of personnel. ? Core Competencies. Development and refinement of organization infrastructure, including external marketing, joint venture relationships, internal operations management, strategic planning and new product development. Have identified and concluded acquisitions. International experience. I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about opportunities at Enron. I will call Cathy this Friday to see if there is an appropriate time when we may speak next week. Sincerely, Michael E. Fitzgerald - Vcresume.doc 
Julie, Thanks for the email.  I have moved again within Enron.  I am now President and CEO (about 3 weeks ago) for Enron Global Markets, a new business unit within Enron's wholesale group.  This group is responsible for all Crude and Products, Coal, Emissions, Global Risk Mgt. (insurance), weather, LNG, F/X, interest rates, equities and agriculture.  It's a wild time yet again for the McConnell family.  It's nice to be back in the energy business. On the technology side, Phillipe Bibi is the Chief Technology Officer for Enron Net Works and he would be a good contact.  His email address is phillipe.bibi@enron.com Thanks and I'll pass on SMU news to Chris.  Her email address at home is mmccontex@aol.com.  Say hello to Bob. Mike Julie King <j_king@gvastrategis.com> on 08/30/2000 04:32:28 PM Please respond to ""j_king@gvastrategis.com"" <j_king@gvastrategis.com> 
Tell Chris that we are heading up to see the SMU ponies in their new stadium!!  Know you are busy, but have been trying to find out the contact person in your new business unit.  Just completed two more assignments for dot.coms, and have two others on the crest of huge developments.  Any help would be appreciate, as we might be able to explore some mutual business opportunities.  Thanks..

CP, Attached is the latest draft copy of the memo.  Each group has had an opportunity to comment and it has been amended several times. I would like you to take a look at it and add your comments and changes.  You are always the key to a good memo and your changes are vital to making this a first rate memo.  Also Freight is in blue and i don't know how to take it back to normal. I would like this out on Tuesday evening.  After i get your version back, go ahead and make your changes directly on the memo. Please send to Jeff for final review and one more pass thru the business units on Monday. Thanks, m 
I'm there! mike Office of the Chairman - Enron Industrial Markets 
Thanks, good luck. m Patrick Wade 09/06/2000 06:20 PM 
Mike, I am in the middle of the Project Triple Lutz data room and unable to attend the OU recruiting meeting tomorrow - HOWEVER, I will do anything you or the recruiting office needs me to do to get more Sooners down here.  Let me know what I can do to help. Patrick 
Wade, Thanks for the email.  I would be an angle investor in your 24 hour a day extension machine.  If anyone could do it, it would be Sanjay.  I would very much like to meet with you.  Jeff as well.  I""ve got several openings that I can create on Wed Sept 13th.  10:30 - 11:15, 1:30 - 2:00; 3:30 - 5:00. Let me know what works. Mike 
Mike, I saw today's announcement regarding you taking responsibility for the Global LNG work. This is great news, and congratulations. And as soon as I fine tune my invention for Sanjay of granting more than 24 hours in a day, I'll forward it to you also, as you both need it. I would like for Sanjay and me to have an opportunity to discuss India and its LNG potential with you. Both Sanjay and I are in town next week for the PRC process, and I am tied up Monday in that and you and Sanjay are busy Tuesday with PRC. Would it be possible to visit with you sometime on Wednesday, Sept. 13 for 30 to 45 minutes so that we can give you an overview of the India LNG market, discuss some opportunities and challenges we have learned in our couple of years of marketing to downstream customers, and perhaps some things that Enron can do to really take a dominant position in the India LNG market? I'll put together a brief overview presentation, and we can walk you through that presentation. After our meeting with you, I would be happy to discuss this with other members of your new team as well. Please let me know if a meeting on Wednesday works for your schedule. Thanks, Wade 
FYI m 
Hope all is well with everyone. An old high school / college buddy sent this to me. It is better than most. Andy ---------- 
Dan, Fred has not had much luck with getting attention with this.  This sounds like it should be in your (new) group.  Please give Fred a call, I think this sounds very interesting and is worth a follow-up. Mike 
Ron, I'm back in the office today and was of course thinking about my car.  Did we make the dates you referenced earlier?  I have a weekend in Oct. that will require a drive to Dallas to meet many of my old school friends and was wondering if I would have the car.  Also, I have an extensive international travel schedule coming and I can schedule around a possible delivery date. Thanks, 
Thank you for signing up to attend the JDF Kick-off Luncheon and for agreeing to be a team leader for our campaign this year. I look forward to seeing each of you at the luncheon tomorrow, Wednesday, September 6th, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in the Imperial Ballroom at 11:30 a.m.  Enron has reserved several tables, so be sure to join us at one of our tables. Again, my sincerest thanks for your commitment to JDF and our campaign.  See you tomorrow. Mike - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - By now all of you should have received an invitation to the JDF 2000 Walk to Cure Diabetes Kick-Off Luncheon on Wednesday, September 6th, 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  I would like to take this opportunity to personally invite and encourage each of you to attend and join me as we represent Enron at this important meeting. Our plan is to reserve several tables at the luncheon just for Enron. Whether you have received an invitation or not, I would like for each of you to make plans to join us at the luncheon.  In order to reserve sufficient seats at the luncheon (and even if you have already made a reservation with the JDF office) please send a brief Lotus Notes message to Cathy Phillips or call her at X-36898 to let her know if we may plan on your attendance. I look forward to seeing you at the luncheon and working with you on the fun and exciting JDF campaign that we have planned for this year.  Thank you. 
Jane, I certainly fine with joining the board. 
Pup, Howdy.   Back from the UK and Norway and am off for vacation to Boston and area for a wedding in Chris' family at lunch today.  There will be 65 Flynns there.  Hopefully it will be cooler. Update for Dallas.  Golf - tee time for 4 (I didn't know if anyone else would join us) at 1:28.  Spa - Brenda and Chris both have 1 1/2 hours massages at 1:50 pm.  If Brenda wants anything else she can call the Four Seasons but at least they both have a spot.  I look forward to the weekend. This is the most prepared we will have ever been for the weekend. Mike ""Jonny Jones"" <jjones@jonesenergy.com> on 08/18/2000 03:39:29 PM 
We have a reservation and made one for you as a backup which I will cancel. Golf & massages sounds great.   1 pm on Friday for golf would be great.  I have the tickets covered. 
You are the first to be invited and there are no plans yet other than showing up.  Will you handle your own reservations? 
We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering staying at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you think. 
Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age. You and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive. Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my friend. Jonny 
Please consider this as authorization for use of this room. Mike Daniel Reck 08/28/2000 06:45 PM 
Mike: Your authorization is required to reserve conference room EB3014 from August 29 - October 15 for the McKinsey Railroad study.  During this time the room will not be available to anyone other than McKinsey team. My assistant, Angie has received authorization from Lisa Cousino, ENA/EGM floor co-ordinator, to utilize EB3014 for the period mentioned, but Lisa needs to hear directly from you that this is ok. Thanks for your help, Dan Reck 
Fred, Louise Kitchen was going to look into this.  Please give her a call and get an update. Thanks, mike Enron North America Corp. 
Fred, thanks for the info and I am going to give it to several people to look at.  I do need to move our meeting.  I'lll be in touch to reschedule. Thanks, mike 
Joe, Sorry for the big delay in all my responses.  I'm out on vacation Wed - Wed. and can't make the video call. Please don't hesitate to set up with Shankman.  In general he is very on board with a big effort in Asia and realizes my views on Asia and that we have issues in Singapore.  Japan will be a  real focus for Enron Global Markets.  He could use an update. mike Joseph P Hirl@ENRON 08/27/2000 05:49 PM 
Mike, Would it be possible to get yourself and Shankman on a video call sometime this week?  While we have given you an update a little over a month ago, quite a bit has happened since then.  This might also be a good intro for Shankman, particularly before we can you the both of you over this way. Wed your time would be preferable... but we are flexible. Joe 
Apologies again, we do need to talk.  Asia is critical to our growth and we do need to talk.  My schedule is a mess but as i stated in last email, go ahead and call Jeff and discuss.  LNG is ours and thanks for the input.  We will be making big changes and growing without incumbency.  Mike Brown does work for us but I dont really know what he does and would like your input. mike Joseph P Hirl@ENRON 08/21/2000 10:01 PM 
Mike, Any chance we could set  a time for Jonathan and me to speak with you and Shankman on crude & liquids possibilities in Asia?  Also has Mike Brown and his group now moved under Global markets?  And lastly, any further thoughts on LNG?  These LNG guys showed up this week without much direction and it turns out the person they were going to meet with is not even here.  In effect, they have come to Japan to make a conference call. Joe 
Understood, here's to hoping. m Darren Maloney@ENRON 08/28/2000 04:30 PM 
Agreed, Mike.  I think they are a strong company, however I don't think they will be looking for another round. I think the 2nd round takes them through the critical mass of content...... --Darren Mike McConnell@ECT 08/26/2000 08:43 AM 
Darren,  thanks for the email update.  I still like this deal.  I hope that we can get back in some day. m 
I got this resume this afternoon.  It sounds like a possible fit for what George was looking for.  Do you know this guy? m 
Mike:  Randy Maffitt, recommended I send you my resume.  I would be very interested in talking with you about activity within Global Markets at your convenience.  I am currently in ENA, but with the scaling back of our development efforts and my Int'l experience, I thought we would have a lot to talk about.  Thanks, Thomas x58286. 
Tom, Thanks for the email.  I talk around the group and see if your background fits our needs. mike Thomas Suffield@ENRON 08/28/2000 09:12 AM

I just read the announcement.  Congrats, I like the structure you guys put in place and I was happy to hear your announcement in particular. You'll do great.  If there is anything I can ever do to help, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Marty, I just read the email.  Congrats, it sounds like a great opportunity, I like the structure.  You'll do great and if there is anything that I can do to help, don't hesitate to contact me. 
Our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.  I would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined below: IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour. New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted. Any change requests that have already been received are currently being considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head. If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH 7/25 Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise. Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near future. A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only. Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if you have any questions or issues related to phones. All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow later): 1 Mega conference room 1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities 1 Large conference room - no videoconference 3 Team rooms File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned file space as close to each individual group as possible. At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries and distribution. Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues. There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the new building. I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great and everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as possible. 
John, Attached is the latest draft for your review.  I changed the format on your section and some of the wording.  I was attempting to make this easier for some of your employees by the wording. Are you sure you want to separate out Doug F from Randy's group?  I also added Doug L in there as well. Please check the wording and spelling of everyone's name carefully. Please make any changes on the attached word file and return. I'll cut and paste your new section in the master memo. Thanks, 
Yes, I thought it went well also.  We can find a way to get a long term commitment from EOTT, thus changing their organization, without taking on the price risk. On the hiring, I think that is a good idea.  If it is put in a way that due to the extensive growth that we expect to have, you want to be in the hiring loop, I don't see how people can object.  It is not a trust situation but an additional reference point.  We are here to help. mike 
Cathy, before I forget, would you please make a tee time of approx. 1pm for 4 people at the golf course at the Four Seasons under my name (friday).  Also if you would set up massages for Brenda Jones and Chris at about the same time or later.  I would really appreciate it.  All can be a little later but cant be any earlier.  We need to begin golf by 2pm to finish. thanks, 
Guys, I received this today.  FYI and follow-up if you're interested. Hope all is well. Mike 
Dear Mike, Rene Ortiz, the recent Minister of Energy for Ecuador (1998-1999) and former Secretary General of OPEC (1978-83) is Conference Chair for a major gas and power conference in Quito, September 18-19.  The Conference is expected to attract key energy leaders from latin America.  I understand that former Sauid Minister Yamani and Fadil Al Chalabi will also attend. Rene is an old, old friend. If this is of interest to you, ENRON please let me know.  From your description of ENRON ONLINE at the Price School of Business in April, I think this is a natural. My Institute for Energy Economics and Policy will also partner with Global Change Associates and a number of major services providers to hold a major conference on energy ecommerce in Beijing, May 24-5, 2001. Again if this is of interest we would welcome ENRON's participation on the program, as a sponsor and/or an exhibitor. Please let me know the next time you visit OU.

Dear Mr. Lay: Because you were recognized Business Week in 1999  for ""taking Enron into the red-hot communications industry"" by ""developing an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business and building a market for trading bandwidth"", we'd like to get your opinion on how we can contribute to your initiative. TBD Networks is a Secure VPN Management software company here in Silicon Valley. We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by: 1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of VPNs. 2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point. 3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific interfaces. 4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service monitoring. We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact? Sincerely, Simon Stokes Director of Sales TBD Networks sstokes@tbdnetworks.com Office (510) 979-1104 Cell (510)593-3771 FAX (510) 687-0206 www.tbdnetworks.com

Thor, Thanks for the email.  The timing of it is amazing.  We were talking about this yesterday late afternoon.  Jeff and I will be in London next week to meet everyone and to get a full briefing of activities and everyone's views of their markets.  Cathy Phillips, my assistant, booked us to go to Norway to meet you and hear about all the activities that are going on there.  I hope you are in and can give us a full download on your business and obviously weather.  We made arrangements to go on Thursday and stay Thursday night.  We made these plans in advance of knowing your availability.  Do you have dinner plans on Thursday evening?  We are scheduled to leave on Friday morning to return to Houston. Please send me a return email to confirm availability and Cathy will add to our schedules.  I look forward to meeting you and learning about your successful business.  Jeff and I will be available for your entire staff, if you would like us to talk about what is going on back in Houston. Thanks, mike Thor Lien 08/17/2000 02:55 AM 
Mike My name is Thor Lien I'm the head of Enron's Nordic Operation and also heading up European Weather.  I would like to connect with you as soon as possible to talk to you about where you see our Weather activity should go, and after having Weather here in Oslo now for a couple off months I also have some comments about Global weather in general that I would like to discuss Thor 
18, 2000 
FYI, are you aware of this?  Were you planning to attend? m 
Greg, Thanks for the clarification.  I guess I was too serious and in a business mode.  By the way, I don't have any photos, all they would do is scare people, especially me. Mike GKarnes@aol.com on 08/16/2000 01:09:18 PM 
God, or Mike I mean to say- I think I may have confused you a little. I don't think we need a picture of you presently (unless you have any nudes, especially a picture of you with a morning missile). What I was trying to say was that I saw one or more pictures of you in the brochure the actives prepared for last year's President's Trophy competition. What I was hoping was that the actives could have some more of those brochures printed up for distribution. You might enjoy a copy. I'm not sure, but I assume they will do another one next year. If so, they might appreciate a new photo if they include an alumni section. It is basically their deal. The alumni did not help them on this project. Greg 
John, Thanks for your outlines.  Here are a couple of others that aren't kid related.  The Choice is just 1 small piece but I love it.  Actually,  The Choice moved me so much, I sold my piece of the business (Excel)  and returned to Enron -  the rest is history. Enjoy, Mike PS - We are way to similar! 
Everett,  congrats! mike 
George, Thanks for the email.  Congrats on the getting non-binding bid, I think. When we get a chance, after Sempra closes, please set up a meeting with all of us and Frevert to discuss in detail.  Also include Jeff Donahue. You are aware of my concerns and issues and we need to discuss them in great detail before we move forward with Pacificorp. Mike 
Greg, I didn't realize you were doing that, that's great.  I am sure they need your help, so few people are willing to give back to their old collegiate experiences.  My thanks as a Sig Ep. I just changed jobs within Enron  (again) and have had a wild and difficult morning and your email made me chuckle.  I have done a few things at OU, and may be coming up in Sept. for a speech, and I'm not sure what pictures you are talking about.  The business school took some pictures and so did the Energy Management Program (the old PLM school) but I have not seen them nor do i know what they did with any they took.  If you are talking about a formal picture, I could provide one with my corporate bio if you need it for some reason. Thanks for the chuckle, mike PS:  I have been called a lot of things including ""that God damned McConnell""  but that is as close as it gets. GKarnes@aol.com on 08/16/2000 09:10:27 AM 
Spot-I don't know if you know it or not, but a year ago I started serving as Treasurer of the Sig Ep alumni board. It has been an interesting experience. Some months back, it came to my attention that you have on occasion dropped by the house. I am not sure what you said or did, but some of those actives now think you are God. In fact, they put together a brochure that helped them win the President's Trophy, signifying the best fraternity at OU, and pictures of your visit were prominent in the brochure. We were kind of hoping that some more copies could be printed, but I am not sure where we stand. Just the same, I thought you would get a kick out of knowing that some of these guys are now getting down on their knees and saying their nightly prayers to you. It has created a bit of a problem in the pledgeship program. If you recall, many of the fraternity's principles were based on God, and some of the pledges seem to think Carter Ashton Jenkins was referring to you. I think with some hard work, this will not be an insurmountable problem, however. HFF, Greg 
Chris, Thanks for the response and thanks for the consideration.  I accept and we're done.  I will have a check out to you today via overnight mail. Price:  9,500 less $500 plus $150 = $9,150 Please ship to: Mike McConnell 13451 Belhaven Drive Houston, Texas 77069 I look forward to doing business with you in the future.  I'll let you know the next time I'm back in the market for a specific piece or artist.  Also please give my home a call (281-895-6855) when the piece gets in the mail so that I can make sure that my wife is around to accept delivery. Sincerely, Mike PS - Your price was right on the mark for an easy personal decision.  My wife actually preferred another piece that was slightly cheaper and this let me get my favorite piece!

Family 
Dons loss was a shock to all of us and his family is in our prayers.  He was a very nice man and his sudden death woke us all up about our priorities. mike Philip Conn@ENRON 08/10/2000 06:28 PM 
Mike, I wanted to personally thank you for your support to the fund that was established for Don's family.  As of today, we raised $4,106.62.  We have now closed this account and are in the process of distributing this money to his family.  I have personally spoken to his family regarding this fund and they were very thankful and speechless at the generosity that the Enron employee's have shown by attending his funeral, creating a scrapbook in his memory, and contributing to this memorial fund. I assured the family that Don would be sorely missed, and although I did not have the opportunity to personally know Don, he must have been a very special person to have touched so many lives, both in his personal life and at work. Philip Conn SR HR Representative 
This year may be more fun.  We are very thin and if our QB goes down or doesn't perform, it will be a long year.  It will definitely be more fun however. m 
Jeff, Attached is the first draft of the first organization announcement.  Please add your changes, ideas and corrections and return to me.  Once you have provide comments, I'll send to sally and Brent to make sure all of the that part is accurate.  Also I have a call into Jere confirming the move on the Corp insurance piece.  I didn't but in anything about Cindy Skinner, go ahead and add that as well. Please don't hesitate to make wording changes.  I don't have any pride of authorship here. Thanks, mike 
Paula, Thanks for the email.  I do have a question.  I am talking with these folks because of your personal reference but how does this work with Project Summer.  Although we don't talk about this, I have heard (not first hand) that there will not be an opportunity for people transfer because of the deal.  I don't want to waste anyone's time if this is just an exercise  What is the scoop? Mike Paula Rieker@ENRON 08/09/2000 02:28 PM 
Mike - As a followup to my voicemail, I am forwarding the resume of Rafi Khan.  I have worked directly with Rafi previously and have a very high regard for him.  Currently is Enron's Middle East/LNG group, Rafi's experience spans tax structuring, financial analysis, risk management and deal structuring and origination.  He also has completed his law degree. Rafi is seeking a Houston-based opportunity and, with his global finance and commercial experience, would be a strong candidate for a position in your new business.  Please expect a call from Rafi.  Thanks, Paula 
Lea, I like this and it gives us something to start with. Let's us this as a ""living"" document and expand it with the thought that we can present this to Ken as a presentation. A few thoughts: Add a section of what the collection will not be. e.g.:  not so contemporary that majority of people will have a very negative reaction.  Understanding that not everyone will ever agree on everything Address a few ideas on key locations and options per key areas.  For example:  5 key large major areas could contain the following themes - 1 large painting by commissioned contemporary recognized artists.  Present a few artists as options and ideas.  Key trading areas:  could be modern and high energy to reflect the culture or the opposite, more serene commentary as a balance.  pick artists as an idea. Address key themes:  trading are will have xxxx, individual business unit common areas can be distinct to their culture with guidelines such as xxxx. Describe the area reserved for Enron  memorabilia? General theme considerations and guidelines: Innovation, global, as you've already addressed List out options with front entry area (Nevelson) Address old building and what we are going to do with the collection:  for example art work will be more consistent within business units and will be re-aligned, common areas will link with new concepts and themes A few thoughts on budget and generally how it will be spent as a guideline: e.g.:  20% will be spent on 5 key areas, 10% on trading floor areas..... Timeline and the need to start now Update:  RC set up and ready, funding by Andy Fastow I hope this helps and gives you feedback as you wanted.  With Jeff and my new responsibilities, we have even less time to spend on this then before.  We should discuss and address now so that it is fair on you and we put that plan tougher as well. Thanks, Mike PS:  I'm sorry but I forgot to address the sponsorship idea you had.  If you still feel strongly about it send me an email and I'll run it through the channels. 
I agree, congrats. mike 
Pup, That sounds great to us.  I take it you are not bringing the kids.  Have you already made reservations and a tee time?  Who else is included in this? Also, am i interfering by inviting ourselves in your plans! Mike ""Jonny Jones"" <jjones@jonesenergy.com> on 08/07/2000 03:27:44 PM 
We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering staying at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you think. 
Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age. You and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive. Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my friend. Jonny 
FYI and follow-up. m 
Mike, It was nice talking to you at the EGM info session on Monday, the 7th at the Hyatt.  As we discussed, I am interested in opportunities within your group, specifically the LNG arena.  I interviewed and discussed this issue with Greg Curran and Doug J Arnell on Tuesday the 8th.  I strongly believe in the mutual benefits derived both from my learning and ability to contribute to your efforts. I am currently in my second rotation working for Dan Leff and Dick Leibert in EES.  I have been at Enron since 1996.  In my former role, I served as the controller for GPG Operations Support (CO 423).  There I managed 25 cost centers which perform O&M, Procurement, Document Mgmt, and Regulatory Services for GPG and other assets across the globe.  My role was the sole source for general administration, budgeting, planning, and financial reporting.  This included management of $19.5M on a gross basis and overseeing the day-to-day operation of the Mustang timesheet system.  I also represented my organization as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the July 2000 implementation of SAP within GPG. In my first rotation in Enron Energy Services I performed analysis, forecasting, and pricing of power and gas risk management instruments. Currently I am working on projects ranging from Customer Satisfaction, system development and implementation, budgeting/space management, California Crisis Taskforce to new business ventures and cost savings initiatives.  Although an American citizen by birth, I have also spent 14 years living in the Caribbean.  I am a team player and a very motivated, high energy individual. My experience, the responsibilities bestowed, along my willingness to give 110% will provide a valuable asset to a group.  I would like to generate a dialogue with you regarding the issue.  If there are any questions or requests of me, please feel free to let me know.  Thank You Adrian Woolcock 
Hope I explained it correctly. He is moving to Houston in 1-2 weeks, so he must be very busy. You should call him when he gets there, I would say. Fernando Herrera 03/27/2001 02:58 PM 
Hi Eric, I started last Monday and this is VERY cool. It is also going to be quite a challenge, as the deals are much more complex than what I had the chance to see in Europe. Seems that I am going to learn a lot!! so far, expectations are met. I am also writing you because I have been contacted by an associate who is very interested in joining the LNG group. He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has been involved with gas transportation and EES. He heard about the Bahama project and thought that he could add tons of value there, as he was raised in Jamaica. He also wants to be involved with a group that allows him to have international exposure and, ultimately, the possibility of working abroad. I am attaching his resume, in case you are looking for people for your group. Have a nice trip back home. Fernando 
Dan, I have read the Synfuel marketing plan, it is excellent work and I would like to see this duplicated (or amended) with AIG or other concepts like this as they develop. Thanks, 
Dan, Thanks for the email and quick response.  I am in the process of discussing this with various people.  A couple of observations that have become clear and  I want to pass them on to you.  Overall, the size of the transaction is not going to fly.  If we brought in other players and significantly reduced our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play, it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal.  Rick Buy stated firmly that Jeff will not be interested in taking this type of deal to the board especially with what just happened with Ecogas and Kafus. I called George last night and touched on these topics but they have been reconfirmed this morning.  I understand that the deal is very active and needs to move forward now, but I think we should inform Pacificorp that we will not take the entire deal.  Last night George stated that he may not want to tell them that and I agreed.  But upon reflection, I think that needs to be re-addressed.  The original deal size is DOA and if I really believe that, then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal potentially closed with these guys.  Also having them assist in bringing others to the table might be beneficial. I'll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more. Mike Daniel Reck 08/07/2000 06:34 PM 
Mike and Jeff: Attached is a copy of the Pacificorp presentation from last week.  To reiterate, the key commercial risk issues are: 1)  Tax--Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the qualifications of the Pacificorp machines.  Thorough due dilligence will be required to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling applications. 2)  Syndication--Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find monetizers.  Ideally, the monetizers would close when we do.  Realistically, we have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we can shed our ownership.  Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in as 25% owner, which should reduce the bridge risk, since we can show the former owner staying in the game. 3)  Operations--The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the equity.  Post-syndication, the new owners can contract directly with an operator.  For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk.  We will guide the monetizers to this risk.  If we have to indemnify them in this area, we will need to better understand the available insurance products. 4)  Marketing--This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.  The desk believes that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over the next 12-18 months.  We have put $6.00/ton into the model, and the desk will buy $3.00/ton today for seven years.  The current market is anywhere from $1.00-3.00/ton.  We have also developed a list of strong sites that are looking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or marketing agreements. The economics of the deal are compelling.  We put out $100mm to Pacificorp as an equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).  We collect $30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity origination. Commercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure around the risks.  The decision we need from senior management is whether this is a game we want to play.  The machines fit into the letter of the law.  Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined in the reindeer games.  We can put on the position we want by bridging this deal. On the flip side, people have heartburn over ""spirit of the law"" issues and those are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance to move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this week whether to put resources on it.  We can back out later (our commitment so far is non-binding), but we can't get back in. Please let me know your thoughts. Regards, Dan 
Dave, Per my voicemail.  Please give me a call on this. Mike

Kevin, A quick question before our meeting.  Didn't we have a little different form that you used at HPL?  I thought I remembered a little different version of the Contract Approval Sheet.  One that had more detail and description of the risks. Thanks, 
FYI, mike 
Jonny, Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more ""success"" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual, it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we can help others and what can we do to really make a difference. The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my love to your family.

Randy, Thanks for the email.  Yes,  life is wild at Enronville.  It was a very difficult decision to leave this group but I am enjoying my first week. I keep up via old channels with your company.  I am so glad that it all worked out and I know you will have continued success. I'll give you a call when things settle down.  I hope all is well with you and your family. mike 
Thanks for including me. Sorry I was unable to attend. 
Greg, Thanks for the email.  I hope all is well with you and your family.  I appreciate you including me in the notice.  This really makes you realize what is truly important. Mike GKarnes@aol.com on 08/07/2000 01:42:24 PM 
Just wanted to let you guys know, that while on a family vacation last week in Red River, New Mexico, the youngest sister on John & David Denner was killed while driving one of those 4-wheel motor bikes. I guess John had to hold on to her lifeless body for about an hour until help could reach the spot on the mountain where she had the accident. I spoke to John on Saturday, and at that point he seemed to be handling it well. The funeral is tomorrow. 
Thanks.  Not going to buy now, closing on a Bonnard.  I will have an interest later. 
Stuart, Thanks for the email and raising this issue.  While reading it, I must admit I was very surprised.  I am not a big baseball fan and have been to only 2 games this year and I hadn't noticed it.  I just called Cindy Olson and left her a voicemail with your concern.  I will not forward your email and I will respect your privacy request.  When I hear from her, I'll let you what she says. Thanks, Mike Stuart Cichosz@ENRON 08/07/2000 11:20 AM 
Mr. McConnell, I went to Enron Field this past Fri.  and saw something disturbing.  Just after the Astros pitcher stuck out a batter, a cartoon came on the screen. The cartoon showed 3 K's dropping on a batter, turning him into a small black puddle. The 1st thing that ran through my mind was the Klue Klux Klan, and some extremely unpleasant memories I've had with them. If I'm alone in my thinking there should be no problem, however if other people have similar thoughts, this could raise some bad publicity. I did not feel gong through the proper chain of authority would be correct in this situation. (The less people that know, the better)   I do not know who the proper contact is to voice this concern, but felt you would be in a better position than me to decide if this is an actual problem, and how to resolve it if it is a problem. Stuart 
Bob, I hope all is well.  I appreciate your thoughts of including me and sending me emails but I need you to take me off your distribution list.  This type of emails are not allowed at Enron and there are consequences with opening them. I hope you understand. 
Brandon, what is the status of the dash? m Brandon Luna 08/02/2000 05:11 PM 
Jeff, do you know this publication? mike 
Mike, We have an opportunity that may interest your management team.  We publish LNG Express and the related website www.LNGExpress.com.  LNG is a unique form of natural gas trade, representing some $20 billion per year and growing at 7-8%/year.  The industry is a fairly insular community.  Our publication, website, industry reports, databanks, annual conferences and consulting services have grown to be possibly the most visible. LNG has a growing spot and short-term contract market. There is currently no exchange for global trades.  Nor is there an exchange for carrier vessel capacity, excess plant capacity, e-procurement or remote gas leases. LNGExpress.com could be platform for such an exchange with content and readers already established.  We might also assist Enron sign up exclusive agreements with LNG suppliers and/or buyers. Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  I suspect this window of opportunity will close quickly.

Jennifer, Thank you very much for your email.  I can still watch everyone's success! I enjoyed working with you and your group.  Best of luck to you in the future. Mike JENNIFER STEWART@ENRON 08/02/2000 02:03 PM 
Mike, Congratulations!  It seems that you might never get to see the fruits of all your labors before they send you off to start-up another organization. Once again congratulations. Jennifer 
Cool,  I don't know what it tells me but I love it.  It looks like a map of world domination! 
Joe,  of course, I'll ask Cathy to set up a time for a call.  I hope all is well.  Things are crazy here,  crazy but great. mike Joseph P Hirl@ENRON 08/06/2000 09:03 PM 
With all of your new responsibilities, is it possible we could set  a time to catch up.  As I mentioned in the voice mail... is this new org change responsible for the recent stock price runup?? :) Joe 
Ted, thanks for forwarding.  They are great. 
Jay, I think that should be looked at and re-evaluated. The way I had it, AS, PB, DB and I (we had commercial and IT infrastructure covered in  1 call) all attended the video calls but I primarily drove the business activities and co-ordination.  I had envisioned Allan and your group taking over directly pre my change and pre other international ongoing activities.  I suggest that all of you re-look at it and do what you want but there are obvious big changes coming that will affect your decision and how we will approach the business opportunities.  I believe they are a great resource for future development and they really appreciated the communication effort and we really helped them. Good luck, Mike Jay Fitzgerald@ECT 08/03/2000 01:50 PM 
Who is to be responsible for these guys and their involvement with NetWorks going forward? Mike.McConnell@enron.com on 08/02/2000 08:31:47 AM 
All, FYI, here is the latest draft of their business plan for your review and commentary.  I had the video call yesterday and went through all the org changes.  I did not provide any commentary on the specifics for obvious reasons. Mike 
link: Mike McConnell) I think there are 2 principal drivers: (1)  the respective Business Unit heads inside of Networks (Houston or elsewhere ) need to know who Steve and I are, that we're involved and that we have a      mandate ( actually this probably warrants some clarification vis-a-vis the Argentine office, as well; especially given the hiring of Bastos - I for one would like      to get a clear and substantive understanding in regard to his trading background, priority for physical vs. financial products, and expectations ) and (2)  we (Enron SA) need an invitation, but also need to probably be more aggressive about participating in meetings, discussions - both strategic and       functional for each of  the Business Units Once we reach a consensus on an Enron SA Bus Plan with focus, targets will establish some parameters to participate inside the group going forward. Mike, your efforts to communicate both updating events vis-a-vis the weekly call and overtures outside the group have been a great initiative and much appreciated.  It's made an important, productive impression on Enron employees ""outside""of Networks.  Look forward to further discussions all around. Steve Nagy 07/21/2000 02:19 PM 
Mike, Per your request, attached is the draft Business Plan for South America. Due to agenda constraints, Joe Kishkill has not yet had the opportunity to review. As part of structuring the regional effort, it would be important to streamline and coordinate the due diligence and market study efforts. There appears to be some confusion between Houston and S?o Paulo over who is responsible for what. We may need to formally announce D'Arcy's and my roles, including the need to channel information through us into and out of the region. Please let us know your thoughts. Thanks, Steve (See attached file: Business Plan Enron Net Works South America.ppt) - Business Plan Enron Net Works South America.ppt 
Great news!  Im glad you and the baby are doing well.

Louise, I do agree.  I haven't really looked at or studied the plan because of the pending changes.  There are some good guys down there and I believe they can do some good work to help you in your quest for world domination.  Good luck with this. Cheers, mike Louise Kitchen 08/02/2000 11:34 AM 
I think there is some duplication from these guys internal to Argentina.  As you know we had a visit from Patrick Hansen, Bastos and Mike Guerriero recently where I think we agreed on the concept behind www.enron.ar - ie using our vertical concept. I think Steve and the team who came here probably need to get on the same page as the presentation doesn't quite reflect where we (Dave Forster) thought they were going. We are not worried if they want to go that way - the budget plans are way out of line though (but they do need to tell us to stop the development we are doing for them). Dave, if Mike agrees - the easiest thing to do would be for you to ring Steve. Louise

I am glad to hear that all is well with you and your family.  I don't have a trip planned currently but I am sure I'll be in London at some point during the year.  I'll give you a call.

introduction 
Jeff, FYI and consideration, here is another speaking oppt!  Jeff S. is the keynote and our group has participated with Bob, Suzanne's husband, before. This is the conference when we came out with EOL last year. mike 
introduction Bob, Thanks for the email and invitation.  I am out of the office traveling right now and must get back to you on my availability. Mike ""Bob Nimocks"" <bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com> on 07/20/2000 04:05:27 PM 
Bob, thanks for the feedback and I enjoyed catching up as well.  Chris and I both enjoyed our discussion and introductions at the dinner too. As far as the 9 initiatives, that number includes all of our activities not just new ones.  We don't have 9 being cranked out in 90 days, at least not yet! When we get closer to your conference, I would be happy to give you a count for your intro. with Jeff. Thanks, Mike ""Bob Nimocks"" <bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com> on 05/17/2000 12:51:47 PM 
Mike, Good to catch up with you and congratulations on a fine opener this morning. I think I heard you say that Enron currently has nine e-business ventures underway and your development cycle from concept to implementation is just 90 days. I would like to use these factoids in Jeff's introduction unless I heard you incorrectly. Kind regards, Bob Nimocks P.S. We're beginning to assemble the program for Interactive Energy 2000, Oct. 23-26, in Houston.  I will e-mail you an invitation to participate on the senior management panel Tuesday morning Oct 24th. 
Steve, thanks for the email.  I will not be attending.

David, you can take me off the distribution list now. Thanks, 
Chris, I got the pictures yesterday.  They looked great and were very clear.  I am interested in buying a Bonnard and am ready to make a decision on the one you have as well.  I will send you a check via overnight mail if we can come to an agreement.  What is your best and final total  price for the work?  I will make a yes or no answer upon my receipt of your email.

Fred, thanks for the info and I am going to give it to several people to look at.  I do need to move our meeting.  I'lll be in touch to reschedule. Thanks, 
Wade, Thanks for the email and invitation.  You never know when I may show up!  I look forward to learning more about this and how our groups work together. Is John's group doing a good job for you? Mike 
Mike, Congratulations on your new position with Enron Global Markets. Obviously, this is very exciting for you and for us. You probably took this job to get away from India, but actually John Nowlan's group serves as the fuel manager for liquid fuels (naphtha and distillate) on the Dabhol project.  So the standing invitation we issued to you when you visited us last still stands. Come over when your schedule allows. Marc de la Roche in your group has been threatening to get me out on one of the tankers during unloading while bucking in the monsoon tidal flow. Maybe you can join me. Wade 
Mark, Thanks for the email.  Yes it was a very difficult decision to leave our group.  I've really enjoyed working with you and your group;  I think we have a great group.   I know you that you are working on  this side of the business already and I will be giving you a call to get your input and direction. Cheers, Mike Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 
Thanks. I'm looking forward to working closer with everone.  Lets get together for dinner.  I'll  ask Chris to call your better half. Mike Brian Redmond 07/31/2000 07:29 PM 
Welcome back Mike. Brian 
Richard, Thanks for the voicemail and email.  Congrats to you also.  Hopefully we will get a chance to work together more often.  I'll give you a call on my next trip to London. Mike Richard Harper 08/01/2000 02:52 AM

Tom, as we discussed, attached is the ENW presentation from the analyst show. It was nice getting caught up. mike 
Thanks for the email.  Reorganize and grow this business?  Not me??!  Upon first look, this business appears to have huge opportunities and ones that can be executed upon, especially if they consider themselves a core business.  It will  be a big challenge but we will make it work in a big way.  A lot of people have tried to make this business work. I'll follow-up on Treasury Connect, thanks for the heads up. By the way, science is Gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and MS in chemistry.  He might be an interesting guy to get involved (at least at the edges) with this project.  I told him about it and he really would like to get invited to the next meeting.  What do you think?  It always helps to have an avid supporter in a new business. Mike 
Congrats!  Those guys better watch out, you might organize them. FYI, we have an investment in a company called Treasury Connect that has an interest rate swap portal.  Gary is working with them to do a trade.  They are currently negotiating with the World Bank to provide a private label product to them. TC's clients include Xerox, GE, Duke and us.  I know with the webification of everything that we will be looking at those markets, but I would like to make sure our guys evaluate their technology offering before you move to far into their market.  They are focused on the very low value, commoditized transactions, so I don't know if it is an area Enron will compete for. Thanks, Mark 
David, Thanks for the email. On metals, I believe all of that will remain under John Sherriff and not our new group.  Paper will remain in NA as well.  Both will be re-examined at some point but not now.  I like Cindy as well, she sounds fine to me.  Who is better, Cindy or Hoyt? Do you want me to co-ordinate with Cindy while you are on vacation? Thanks, Mike David Oxley 07/29/2000 07:51 PM 
Mike, I asked team to get you some org charts, personnel numbers and PRC results on Friday. They may be a little sketchy but we can refine for you over next few days. I specifically want to go over employment agreement and comp information with you. Couple of things of immediate note: - MG metals is an issue from an HR stand point. I believe (possibly wrongly) that much of the NA end of this will fall in your world. Immediate issue appears to be desire to let go some staff that MG hired immediately before deal went unconditional that now don't fit. Hickerson is aware of where we are and I'll keep you informed as things develop. - I am planning to dedicate Cindy Skinner (Shankman asked me specifically for her and I think she is ready for this challenge) to the new business as your lead HR person but I also have Hoyt Thomas (you may remember him from 96/97 era) in the team for the next 6 months (he is on a contract at present and we may make it permanent). I'd like to discuss this with you next week. - I am planning vacation for about 10 days from Weds of next week, but will leave you contact numbers. David 
Billy, I like it.  My only suggestion is to put in a statement like - that after all your discussions with business unit head and AAs  we are (changing) improving the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see.  I think this could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally. Just an idea, I like it very much as it is. Good luck,

The opportunities to continue to grow our=20 natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical = to=20 Enron=01,s future success that we remain focused on expanding these busines= ses=20 and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets. It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside = of=20 gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnin= gs=20 growth.  We have made significant progress in developing these businesses i= n=20 North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net Works business unit= . =20 Included in these developing businesses are our efforts in crude and=20 products, coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest=20 rates, paper and pulp, and metals. While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to=20 accelerate the growth in these new businesses while continuing to=20 aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North Americ= a=20 and Europe.  In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize = on=20 the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today= =20 announcing the formation of a new business unit =01) Enron Global Markets. = This=20 new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in= =20 scope, but outside our traditional gas and power markets.

Allan, Would you please contact this guy and see what he wants.  We need to follow-up because his dad is on the board with me for JDF and he was the number  2 guy at Compaq with Rod Canion.  He is a Ken Lay buddy as well. Please find out if there is any synergies here and if not please simply respond and say thanks no thanks.  We just don't want him to think that Enron blew him off. Thanks and i hope it is not a waste of time. Mike 
Scott, I was following up on a few old items, has anyone contacted you from Enron?   If yes, please let me know, if not please resend email and i'll follow-up to make sure you get a response. Thanks, Mike McConnell

Jeff, yet another email.  This article just got re-written but obviously needs to be updated.  What do you think about putting in your name on this? Mike 
Hi Mike-- Thanks for the added comments and corrections to the first draft.  Here's the final, if you'd just send me back an okay, so we can move forward with it. Thanks again for your cooperation. Doug 
Jeff, Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.  I told him that I am not available but it does look good and it is in a nice place - also the speakers are first rate.  What do you think?  If you are interested please let Steve know.  I told him that I thought everyone was busy. Mike 
per your request, attached is a list of speakers at the Industry Standard conference.  It looks like a very strong list. They would like to get an answer by Thursday. My suggestion would be for me to go ahead and RSVP that I will do the speech. If McMahon is available and wants to do it then we will have the slot held. 
Hello Stephen, As you requested, here's a list of confirmed speakers. Enron will get a prime slot on Thursday September 7, though we can move it to either Friday or Saturday if that fits your schedule better. And you'll have a keynote session, whereas many of the CEOs below will be on panels. Hope to hear a confirmation from you very soon.

Joe, Attached below is a draft of an EGM update and org announcement.  It will be broad in scope and will address many areas.  Please review and provide comments especially on the Japan part.  I went ahead and took a stab at the first cut here and expect you to make all the changes and emphasis you feel is appropriate.  We are a couple of weeks away from discussing every player (Morten Erik) that is why I left it very broad.  Please take a moment, change and send back to me for examination and incorporation. I wanted to get this out on Friday, but may have to wait until early next week while i am on the road. Thanks, Mike 
LK, Nice presentation, I'll give other comments later. 
Matt, I did send on your email to 3 people at EBS:   Ken Rice, CEO; David Cox, MD; and Kevin Garland, VP of investments.  They are all out of the office thru next week.   If you don't hear back from someone in a couple of weeks, please let me know. Thanks and good luck.  Say hello to my good friend Robin. 
David, Attached for your information is an email from the CEO of Six Foot Studios. This guy is the brother-in- law of Robin Gibbs, one of the top litigators in the country.  Robin and his firm is used a great deal in our key cases for Enron.  This looks like a cool company but I have no idea if you have any interest in his company or it's products.  I do, however, need someone to follow-up with him, even if it is a polite discussion that we don't have any interest.  We need to respond in some manner.  I forwarded this a while ago but he didn't hear anything. He is successfully getting in to companies in Houston and Compaq is a big supporter.  I hope there is an opportunity here. Thanks, Mike

Greg and Jeff, Attached is the draft announcement for the organization changes.  I am sure you will want to change the ENW piece, so far the focus was on the wording from the wholesale side but the titles should be correct for ENW. Please provide your comments and I'll make sure they get included correctly. Thanks, Mike 
Mark and David, David I got your latest comments this morning.  I like them and added the correct Enron Net Works changes. I will send this to Greg and Jeff immediately to work on the ENW piece, I am sure they will add to it and change it. Thanks, Mike PS;  Mark, I haven't seen your draft, what do you think about this one? 
David, Thanks for the comments and updates.  I didn't know exactly how it was structured.   I am waiting on the revised draft from Frevert.  After I get that one I will circulate it to Greg for his additions for the Net Works pieces. I don't believe that we are going to add Shankman to the executive committee right now.  I am assuming the same is for Lavo.  There may be an appropriate time in the near future to make changes to the committee and they may be considered then. I don't think they want to add any additional people at this time.  Mark may have a different opinion and if he does, I am sure he will add it. I do think we should add that Mark is Chairman of all the organizations. Thanks, Mike David Oxley 07/27/2000 03:37 PM 
Mike, I'll review first para. and get a revised version back to you. Believe Mark was discussing/;looking at eblow but FYI my comments on the rest are: - Wasn't clear on emmisisons, but believe that is McGowan who reports to McClellan - Tawney reports to Overdyke - Thought Overdyke was Insurance and Weather -  Won't Shankman also get elected to to the Exec Committee? -  Above being case I would suggest we announce same for Lavo. - Should we add that Frevert remains Chairman of Europe and ENA. David 
Steve, Sorry I missed you yesterday.  There is a lot going on here and in S America and we can probably discuss it next week.  I agree with your assessment of and the need to clarify roles and implement the business plan.   We will address all but there are some things going on that make it appropriate to wait a little.  If you have any questions you can address them with Joe but I would wait and keep moving forward on your daily business and projects. I like the plan and we will discuss my comments next week. Thanks, mike
