Can you come down to my desk around 1:00? D 
Do you have any time this afternoon or Monday to look at the Tenaska spreadsheet?  I am trying to close out Jan 2001 and I have some questions. Megan 
Megan, I changed the demand fee for Jan.  It looks like Trisha has changed the Transport ticket for the $.11.  I agree with the header charges. D 
TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and $0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18. Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called ""Compression & Header Expense if Utilized"".  The current rate for 1856 is $0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair. Thanks, Megan Daren J Farmer@ECT 03/13/2001 10:54 AM 
I have made the changes mentioned below.  I've also adjusted the spreadsheet based on our conversation yesterday.  Take a look at it when you get a chance. D 
We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it. Deal 514353		Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113 Deal 384258		Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11 I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms. I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV. Thanks, Megan <Embedded StdOleLink> 
FYI 
Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the delivery period .  If you need any additional information or have any questions, please contact me at 35656.  Thanks.  EMV 
Tim, Please forward this to the appropriate person. Scott Berkman with Bruggers Bagels is looking to buy gas delivered to their chain of stores.  He mentioned locations in Minn, Iowa, Detroit, Pitt, Cleveland, Boston, and Albany.  His phone number is 802-660-4020 ext. 264.  I would apprectiate it if someone would contact him regarding this supply.  Thanks. 
Aimee, Please take care of this in POPS.  It looks like we've already hit the 50,000 mark on #572910. D 
Diane, I apologize for getting this to you so late. I should have no staffing additions next year. Staff Manager 1 Sr.  2 Average to High Training Both Seniors should attend 1 personal enrichment class (Effective Communication) and 1 Technical class. I think that everything else should roll for next year. Let me know what else I need to give you. D Diane H Cook 09/14/2000 03:12 PM 
SALARIES, SALARIES, SALARIES!!!   Everyone is having problems. Unfortunately, many of you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your staff's salary is.  I have the average salary for each of the different staffing levels.  I have asked the HR department to also give me the low and the high.  Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most likely are not what they are going to be next year!  To much movement of people.  So using estimates and averages will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels. Here's what you can do: 1) Make a list of your staff just their positions. 2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to average, etc. You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that position, etc. 3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget. 4) Here is the average: Sr. $4,961 Spec $3,964 Staff $3,026 Sr. Clrk $2,548 Clerk $2,264 Asst $3,162 Your list would look something like this: Assistant Average Clerk  Very High Sr. Clerk Low Specialist Low to Average Specialist Average Sr. Specialist Average to High Analyst  (They are all allocated at the same amount) You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them.  It's up to you. Next Item - TRAINING!!! Here's what you can do: 1) List your staff and the type of class they need 2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what type of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip) 3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700 4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000. 5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest. Next Item - Headhunters! Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees. Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the year that people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts).  If you forget these items, I will make sure it is added to your budget. Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will review them so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully this helps you some. Diane x-37059 
BH, I plan to be on vacation July 5-6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the 7th.  While I am out, Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during trading.  Stacey will be in charge of everything else.  I am comfortable that everything will be covered. I will be back in town Thursday night.  The primary flight for the customer trip leaves around 11:30.  Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).   The latest idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the office for half the day.  I can also come in for the half day on the 7th if we decide that is needed. 
We did buy 5,000 from Beamont Meth.  The sale on 603107 should have been confirmed at 18,000 and the buy on deal 611178 should have been confirmed at 5,000 for the 9th. D Aimee Lannou   03/19/2001 09:44 AM 
Daren - did we have a purchase from Beaumont Methonal on 2/9?  I show a deal of 5.000 on deal 611178.  I confirmed a total of 13.000 (deal 603107) for that day.  Were we buying back 5.000 or was the deal reduced to 13000? Aimee

We should not be paying Tenaska's Lone Star transport for Sep.  That should be paid by Tenaska IV.  We took over the payments with October production. D Katherine Benedict 12/05/2000 04:44 PM 
Hi Guys, Please do me and Bob Fisher in the Transport Settlements group a huge favor......Please let us know when the TXU/Lonestar  transport deals for Tenaska IV Texas Partners have been entered into Path Manager (for September 2000). I am holding the transport invoice from TXU/Lonestar for September 2000....waiting to enter the ""actuals"" into our system for payment. Thanks, Kathy  :  ) 
HOw much does that cost?  I mayh run it through Tom's RC. Laura Harder@ENRON 12/13/2000 08:46 AM 
I had Daniel Queada request CQG for Stacey, and when I checked the status of the request, it shows that it's pending.  After trading, and when you get a second, can you go into the IT website and approve it?  Call me over if you want me to show you how to do it. Thanks, Laura 
possibly friday.  I will take Mon the 18th off also. Laura Harder@ENRON 12/13/2000 08:37 AM 
Just wondering ... are you going to take any of the vacation days that you have written in the calendar for this week? 
In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing money to Tenaska IV. I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in the future. Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this. Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim. Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we reimburse Tenaska IV. D 
I created # 529824 for Nov and Dec. D 
I created deal 682029. D Michael Olsen@ENRON 03/20/2001 12:55 PM

Gary, The deal with Williams Terminals expired in Oct.  However, about 3,800 flowed for Nov.  Do you need to renegotiate this deal for Nov.  Or, do we roll it under the terminated k?  What do think about Dec? D

Mike, You can come down anytime.  The mornings will be the best time to learn, but you can spend as much time as you want.  Since things are so crazy, I may not be able to answer all of your questions immediately, but can answer them later.  I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.

Daren, I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that it would help me better grasp the process as a whole. I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day, morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good time.  I think it will help me very much in my role. Thanks. Mike 
I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal numbers you listed are WRONG. Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.  It has a zero nom.  You can send that to POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on. I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2). Deal 529738 is valid for mtr 1598.  It has a zero nom, also.

Daren I have three meters that have flow in Feb but no deal. 1.  Meter 0416  flowed the whole month  1-28.  This our ols friends at Pawnee gas plant fuel.  Last deal used was 289396 could you extend it. 2. meter 1601 had flow on the 15 &18.  This is Southern union Lockhart.  Last deal used with them was 285350 Hpl or 259208 ENA. 3. Meter 1598 had flow the whole month 1-28.  This is MT Enterprise C/G- Panther.  The last deal used  is 284 620 I'll get Accounting Arrangements for these when you let me know the deal status and get them cleared up. Thanks.

You need to speak with Reps from Exxon and Highland.  Ask them about their Lone Star transport allocation.  They had to transport the gas on Lone Star to sell to us.  So, Lone Star should have given them an allocation on their transport deliveries at that point (or their supplier's contracts) to match the sale volume.  Adjust our purchase amount from each party based on the transport allocation. D Rebecca Griffin@ENRON 12/07/2000 02:47 PM 
I am working on clearing an old TXU Lone Star/Gas Distribution balance from 8/99 and 9/99.  We originally billed TXU on nominated quantities and they have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments.  These are brokered deals where we sold to TXU and purchased from ExxonMobil and Highland.  TXU has provided meter support since the deals were on Lone Star pipeline, however, I am unsure how to have Volume Management reallocate. For example, we originally sold 10,000 mmbtu on 8/3/99 to TXU and purchased 1,200 mmbtu from Highland Energy and 8,800 mmbtu from ExxonMobil.  TXU shows the total amount of gas on 8/3/99 was 9,240 mmbtu.  How should the purchase piece be allocated between ExxonMobil and Highland since this was a brokered deal?

Driscoll Ranch #3 Duval Co., TX Team, We are still waiting on the Agreements to be returned to us for the Camden Driscoll Ranch #3 Well.  We should receive them by Monday, December 4, 2000. I spoke with the field guy today (Bobby Husky) and he stated that the well would not be ready to turn on until 3 weeks from now.  He said that an amine plant is being installed.  Therefore, we are waiting on them.  This is just an FYI to everyone.    This will still be booked for December 2000.  Please forward this email to anyone that I might have left out. Thank you!

Megan, I have created deal 514353 to capture the $.04 agency fee for the Tenaska deal.  This deal will have zero volume and zero commodity price with a demand charge of $.04 on 45,000/day.  Since there is no volume, Mark McCoy will be scheduling this deal as a zero nom.  Hopefully, this will allow the demand charge to flow through the system.  Let me know if you don't see this happening.  For Sep and Oct, you will need to get someone in Volume Management to create an accounting arrangement for this deal (pathed to the imbalance pool).  When actuals come in, you can give me the volumes and I will change the demand charge.  I took the demand charge off of the sale ticket (#384258).

Mary, This is all the information that I have when Ami first looked at all the CES information.  It does not mention a processing agreement, but that does not mean that there isn't one. Daren - do you know anything about a processing agreement for the Devon gas at the Gulf Plains plant as it relates to the CES acquisition? 
You've got to love idiotic calls, don't you?  An onside kick after you've won the game?  What was Barnett  thinking? I don't think I'll ever watch another Aggie football game...ohh, the misery. I can't handle the emotional rollar coastar. Anyway, How was Thanksgiving?  Did you make your trip out to pick up the 15 ft christmas tree?  Or was it bigger this year?  We made the journey to Tuscaloosa.  The trip wasn't too bad.  That TV/VCR is a lifesaver.  I ate way too much, but it sure was good. Hope everthing's going good for you and the family.

If you need it, I've got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and fuel from each location (there numerous receipt points).  It is possible that we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion.  In that case, we can use the same transport contract on Lone Star and transport on other pipes also.  Any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed on to the plant. If you have any questions, let me know. D Katherine Benedict 11/22/2000 11:23 AM 
Hi Darrin, This is what Mark McCoy sent me about the Cornhusker Deal.  Please review and if there is anything else that Rita Wynne or I need to know about this deal, just shoot me an e-mail! Thanks for calling me back! Happy Thanksgiving, Kathy 
Kathy-----Here is what I know about Cornhusker: Our supply comes from Apache & Williams Our market typicially is the plant (Tenaska IV Partners) If the plant is down, Brazos Utility has the right to the gas if they want it If Brazos does not call for the gas, then we will sell off to whomever we can We just get a flat fee on this gas per MMBtu, whether it goes to the plant or not Daren Farmer knows the specifics about the deal Hope this helps, call with any questions. Mark x33396 
For October, Tenaska IV should be paying us.  We bought gas from Apache and Williams on Lone Star Pipeline.  We sold that gas to Tenaska IV when the Cleburne plant was operating.  On days the plant was not operating, we sold that gas to other counterparties (the sales on Lone Star you see for ENA). For September, we may need to pay them an amount, but I need to check into that.

Daren- There is an effective communication course on December 7 (Thursday) from 1-5pm.  Is this the one you suggested for me, and if it is, may I attend this one?  Please let me know.  It is listed through Ernie and is $200.  Thanks for looking into this.

Are we going to have some quality problems with this gas?  EDG 
Well- I have officially NOT heard from Hilcorp after numerous voice and email messages.  Please plan to have the gas rerouted back down the valley line for the Dec 1 forward.  Call if you have any questions- Daren J Farmer 11/21/2000 10:08 AM

I extended deal 461059 for the rest of October. D Mary Poorman@ENRON 11/15/2000 02:55 PM 
Daren, I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85% of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt. Mary 
Done. 
Please change the demand fee on deal 157288 for 8/00 from $9,575.45 to $6,143.64.  We need to reduce our payment to Duke.  When I adjusted the over delivery charge on the days we didn't nom,  the demand amount changed.  I waited until Duke agreed before I sent you this change. Thanks, Megan 
Briant, I'm not going to be interested.  I'm looking for a boat that is a little bigger.  Thanks. D Briant Baker 03/21/2001 08:17 AM 
I checked the boat and it is 17 ft, 7 in. long, it is a Capri model # 1750CH, it has a am/fm cass.  The motor is 3.0L MerCruiser Alpha Sterndrive (135 hp) 
The buy and sale should net out, nothing to be billed to paid to TGLO.  The volumes should be the same on both sides.  Whoever backs up Tom should reallocate in POPS to make this happen. We had to show a buy/sale in order to schedule the delivery to TGLO on a third party pipe. D Katherine Herrera@ENRON 11/17/2000 04:30 PM 
Daren- Deal # 421859 Sales Deal # 421847 Purchase Settlements is showing both a sales and purchase for Texas General Land Office and they are stating that they should not be billed or paid for anything. Are these deals suppose to be a washout and netted together? If so, the volumes are not matching: the sales on HPL are 7,440 mmbtus on deal #421859 and the purchase on MidTX is 6,629 mmbtus. Let me know what type of deal this was intended to be. FYI I was told that Tom Acton was handling this deal, but I believe he will be out until after Thanksgiving. 
Done. FYI.  Due to scheduling concerns and contract language, I changed the delivery point on this deal to Eastrans pipeline, instead of HPL.  This should clean up the allocations for this area.  Also, beginning on Nov 15th, we cut the swap to zero, and I purchased the gas at Cotton Valley under a spot agreement (#484935). Let me know if you have any questions. D Enron North America Corp. 
Hey, AC! How are things going for you?  Liking your new freedom, wild girl?  I hope your having fun.  I'm sure missing you on Entex.  I'm already feeling the heat from TM.  With the cold spell and the change in weather forecasts, I have to re-evaluate Entex everyday.  But, that's the way it always is over here.  I've been meaning to e-mail you, but I always remember after I leave the office.  Anyway, let me know how it's going. Later,

Bob, I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket. D 
Daren, Please read this memo and the one dated 2/21/01 from Vance.  He told me all new production should be entered at IFHSC.  The deal in question is 634075.  Do you want it changed to Gas Daily?  Please advise.  Thanks. Bob 
I added these days to #483894. d Aimee Lannou   11/13/2000 11:54 AM 
Daren - meter 1601 has flow from 11/8-11/10.  There is no deal for these days.  Last deal used was for Oct. - 413538, counterparty Southern Union. Will you let me know if you set a deal up for this? Thanks. Aimee 
This has been corrected.  A transport usage ticket should have been used, instead of a desk to desk. D Enron Capital Management 
Why is there a different deal?  And what is the price? D Mary Poorman@ENRON 11/14/2000 08:54 AM 
I need HPL Sales and Purchases, back dated to 8/99 between HPL and TECO to book any processing revenue or losses.  Apparently this is in addition to the current deal in place and is priced at at different rate.  Please let me know when these tickets are in place so that I can get track id's and finalize this issue. Thank you, Mary 
I think I hate football too.  4th and goal on the 3 yard line, to win the game, and RC decides to change his lifelong coaching strategy from run, run, run, to pass the ball.  Why not Ja'mar??  The guy who carried 3 defenders into the end zone earlier.  Anyway, we beat the spread and I got $20 from your friend Mary.  So things are not all bad. How did the Corn boys lose?  If I would have known about it on Saturday, I would have called to console you and the family.  Maybe it's time to just turn our attention to the NBA and leave this heartache behind.

A meeting was held on November 1, 2000 at 3 pm in EB3270 to resolve Exxon's residue volume issue at Teco's Indian Spring Plant.   Exxon's issue is that the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to PGE. Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved: 1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production. 2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL. 3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes. 4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must pay to Teco an additional $500 per month. Solution: 1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884 that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line. 2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL Meter #986884. 3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes. 4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d. If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please let me know at X-36650. Thanks, Clem

I rolled deal 418382 for Nov 1st. D Mary Poorman@ENRON 11/08/2000 01:39 PM 
Daren, I have flow at this meter for the first, 118 Dth.  There is an expired purchase from Highland at the meter, but, this deal ended August 31st.  HPL had a deal with Highland in October to purchase these volumes (deal ticket 418382).  I think that the deal needs to be extended, it looks like the valve was not completely shut by 9 am.  Pat has asked that this issue be resolved today, so, your assistance would be greatly appreciated. Mary 
Gary, Do you have any record of this? D 
Daren - was there a deal for 5.000 at CP&L on Feb. 21?  CP&L shows 5.000, but I have looked in MOPS and there is not a deal.  Can you verify whether or not there was a deal for that day?  Thanks. Aimee 
Aimee, I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct? Thanks for your help. Rebecca 
The deal with Oxy Vinyls (#276478) will covers the volume for all of October.  We had zero in the system after the 6th because the plant was down.  The deal should have been nom'd at zero on these days. D Susan Hadix@ENRON 11/07/2000 10:33 AM 
Daren, A sale to Oxy Vinyls went into effect 10/01 through 10/16 for 5,000 per day. We also delivered gas to Entex, 10,000/day for the entire month.  More gas was pulled towards the end of the month than confirmed and I need to know if Oxy Vinyls should get the swing for the remaining of the month even though their deal went to zero.  Please advise. Susan

Hey, Dwight. Everything is going fine here.  Thanks for your message.  I'm feeling pretty confident with how things are going.

However, I would like to discontinue our sessions for the time being. When I'm in need of some ""managing expertise"" in the future, I will give you a call. Again, thanks for working with me. 
I created #454057 for the flow at Mtr 5192.  Canny Conner is looking into mtr 6387.  I will let you know when he determines what we will be doing. D Aimee Lannou   10/26/2000 10:01 AM

PW, HPL's spot and base purchases by zone for April 2000 are reported in the attached file.  Let me know if you have any questions. D 
Susan, Are you clear on what you need to do with this? D 
FYI.  You may want to check with someone to see if this will affect you this weekend. D 
The POPS Production database server will be down over the weekend for a 3 hour period for memory upgrade. Please let me know if there is a preferred 3hr window, if there is no problem with y'all,  can we will request the maintenance  between 12-3pm Saturday 10/21/00. I'll inform y'all of the actual timeframe once its finalized, since there are other systems running on that server. thanks Romeo 
Robert will be coming too.  He said that he will be buying your lunch, since you wouldn't accept his x-mas present last year. Just kidding. D ""buylow"" <buylow@houston.rr.com> on 10/19/2000 02:20:05 PM 
32nd floor ----- ok. ? If Lauri or Carlos want to go that would be fine with me. I'll  leave that up to you. ? See you then ............................. If I can find  somewhere to park. ? Ken 
We are on the 32nd floor now (Thru the glass door and turn right), if your badge still works.  Or, give me a call from the Lobby and I'll come get you. Would you like me to invite anyone else to go with us (Carlos, Lauri, etc)? It doesn't matter to me. 
On Feb 7, we sold 10,000 to Duke Energy Field Services at Waha.  However, I entered the deal (#603484) under Duke Energy Marketing (Can you believe I made a mistake?).  To correct this, I created a new ticket (#700132) under DEFS. Mary - Please repath these deals and let Megan know when you're done. Sorry for the extra work. 
Please join us in wishing Ami good luck in her new endeavors as she is moving to California ... DATE:   Thursday, Oct. 19th TIME:     5:00 p.m. WHERE:   Cafe Noche - The Patio (2409 Montrose Blvd.) The reservations are under Ami's name.  Also, if the weather turns ugly, Cafe Noche will make other arrangements for us, so please come celebrate with us! 
Lee, On deal 413447 (Chevron @ Olefins), we have a flex nom of 6,000 to 12,000/day.  Is this a monthly nom or daily nom?  Will we have a swing deal with them for the winter?  The current swing deal is for Oct only.  For Oct, they have pulled an average of 16,000/day. 
We have adjusted Suemar in Sitara.  And will probably adjust it again in a few days.  Since we bridge back estimates daily, the production at the Berryman well has been adjusted in the economics.  So, this will not have an impact on UA4. D Mary Poorman@ENRON 10/18/2000 08:34 AM 
Daren, As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is that we are ""overproduced"" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not, please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month UA4. Thank you, Mary 
Why don't you come to the office around 11:00.  (I'll be trading Waha until 10:30 or so.) You can come up and say ""hi"" to everyone.  Or, we can just meet in the lobby and walk over. 
Another national crown ... It must be nice.  We have to keep referring back to our one and only in 1935.  But, we will never forget it!  I am looking forward to the 28th.  Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game.  We'll see how that goes.  Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that weekend.  That should be a good battle.  OU also has a week off to get ready for you.  (I think they should be rated #2). Things are going ok here.  I can't remember if we've talked about the sale of HPL.  That is getting closer to happening.  I am hoping it does.  I'm ready to go on to something else, and that would make it much easier.  Ami Chokshi decided that she would leave the co. this week.  She is heading of to San Fran.  No job or any specific plans yet, but it's always something whe has wanted to do.  It would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like that. How's everything else going for you and the family.  We are all doing pretty good.  I actually took last week off.  The only plans I had were to spend time with the family.  It was great!  It really drove the point home that I need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities. Anyway, would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday?  I'm sure it's been a while since you've had your Treebeard's.  Let me know.  Sorry I haven't talked to you much.  I'm going to end up losing all my friends if I don't change my ways. 
FYI. I changed the pricing on the September deal (#386540) to IF HSC-.05 from HSC GD. D 
I created deal #439909 for August. Jeff - I am assuming that the price for August is Gas Daily.  Currently, we have the September deal priced at Gas Daily also.  Since this was flowing on the first, should the price be at Inside Ferc HSC for September? D Mary Poorman@ENRON 10/13/2000 03:42 PM 
Sorry about that, I had some tech difficulty with the first version and the subject line, which was pertinent, was not included. Mary - Good catch Carlos 
JM, Is the contract for this deal still valid?  I want to roll the deal for Sep and Oct. D 
Daren--- I need some help with meter 5892 for September 00 due to a feedback error. Deal 133196 (purchase from Duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due to it's expiration date of 8/31/00......however it still showed up in POPS (w/o a nom) on 9/1.  Volume management allocated volume to it according to the allocation statement.  Should this deal be extended?  I noticed it is not out there for October either.  I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if you want to see them. Let me know, Mark x33396 p.s. Fred Boas said you used to handle this and you were very wise in the art of allocation......so I am expecting big results Grasshopper! 
You're right.  I have corrected the ticket. D Tina Valadez 10/17/2000 09:20 AM 
The buyer's name on deal440093 is Koch Midstream shouldn't it be Duke Energy Field Services? Daren J Farmer 10/17/2000 07:09 AM 
I have created two new deals in Sitara.  You will need to get with someone in Volume Management to reallocate volumes from the old tickets to the new deals for Jan-Sep.  The Logistics group will be able to adjust October forward. Deal #s: 144052 --> 440092 144049 --> 440093 Let me know if you have any questions. D Tina Valadez 10/16/2000 11:50 AM

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say that Duke should be paying us for the gas. I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard back from anyone. This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct contract in place for the deal. D Tina Valadez 10/10/2000 10:18 AM 
I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue? Thanks, Tina Valadez 3-7548

A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a record of a spot deal with them for that day. Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If you don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is. D Rebecca Griffin@ENRON 03/27/2001 04:08 PM 
Daren, I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this? Thanks for your help. Rebecca

JM, The message below is related to deal #138094.  According to Joan, October is the last month for this deal.  However, the evergreen flag is activated in Sitara and a new line has been created for November.  Can you look into this please? D

Has this been resolved? D 
Liz or Stacey - There is flow at meter 74 on 9/14 (499 dth).  The deal for this meter (400289) did not start until 9/15.  Could one of you extend the deal for this?  I would be greatly appreciated. Aimee

Sandi, The exisiting contracts on Lone Star are sufficient to cover deliveries to the plant (95,000 Mmbtu maximum daily quantity).  In the event that we have to transport excess gas to alternate locations, we will be using an ENA transport agreement and charging the expense back to Tenaska IV. D 
Megan, For 8/1/00, allocate the receipt of gas a Cotton Valley to the exchange deal.  Since we did not deliver anything to them on that day, the settlement will occur at GD-.10.  Originally, we were working on a spot deal for this day.  Then, after the fact, we agreed to let the deal fall out under the exchagne deal.  I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket. For the weekend of 8/5, we need to prorate the gas over the weekend.  Due to operational issues, we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the deliveries on Monday.  I apologize for not getting this info to you earlier. D Enron North America Corp. 
Sandi, Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week. The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will be adjusted yearly based on CPI. Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do you agree with this? D

The price should be 3.56.  There had been alot of price and volume discussions for this gas day and 8/1/00.  I checked the notes and found that we actually settled at 3.56 instead of 3.58. D Katherine Herrera@ENRON 10/05/2000 08:11 AM 
Daren- Sell to Tenaska Marketing July Deal # 399791 Tenaska is indicating that the sale for July 2000 should be priced at $3.56. Could you confirm our sale price should have been $3.58?

Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized through legal.  However, we were able to ""get between"" a few deals and make some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with the customers. Buy from Tenaska IV July 399763 Aug 399773 Sell to Tenaska Marketing July 399791 Aug 399797 Sell to ANP Aug 399814 The trading desk these are on is ""ENA-IM Cleburne"".

Please advise. Below, you will find the number of cards we have that were purchased for your group. Thank you, Heather Choate, x33278 
Matt, Each month, prior to bidweek, I pull up a monthly range in Path Manager to get a feel of how many of our swing customers operated in a prior month (or a month in a prior year).  I have never had problem with this before, and I have done this task every month since Unify was put into production.  When the problem occurred this month, I was attempting to view Apr 1-30, 2000 on Houston Pipe Line, with HPL as the shipper.  This information is very important for my bidweek preparation.  So, I need to continue perfomorming this operation each month.  If needed, I can wait until 5 pm top view the range. D 
FYI.  Forward the info to me for anyone you want to send cards to.

I had problems in getting the newest version of Access.  So, please see the attachement below related to the OPM Hours Survey. 
Megan, I have made these adjustments.  HOwever, I would like for you to double check August.  We knew that Pan Energy would be over delivering at Cotten Valley for 8/9/00 through the end of the month.  So I changed the pricing on the deal to the GD-.10 settlement price for that time period. D Enron North America Corp. 
I fixed it. Enron North America Corp. 
Done.  I could not seperate the excess charge and cashout charges under the demand expense.  They are combined on the ticket. D Enron North America Corp. 
I have no idea why payment would be suspended.  I don't remember having any problems with Ocean Energy.  Sorry. D Cynthia Hakemack 10/02/2000 05:19 PM 
Daren, There are five HPLC purchase deals for 09/99 from Ocean Energy Inc. They were Craig Falbaum's deals.  A person who is no longer in my group suspended payment for these deals.  Gary suggested that I contact you and see if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended, or know anything that might help.  Thanks. 
These are not spot deals.  PanEnergy did not receive gas on the exchange. However, they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley.  According to the contract, when volumes are overdelivered, HPL buys the gas at GD-.10.  So, in order to correctly estimate our economics, I changed the price on the delivery to reflect how the deal will settle.  This occurred in August and September.  Any spot deals will be on seperate tickets. Days 5 & 6, as well as 9-31 should be settled as if the exchange was in place.  (PanEnergy overdelivered about 7,800 per day, which we buy at Gas Daily -.10) D Enron North America Corp. 
I rolled this deal for day one in October only. Bob - Please check with Vance on this deal.  Has it terminated or should it roll for October.  I don't think that Vance nom'd anything. D Aimee Lannou   10/02/2000 10:49 AM 
Daren - Meter 9707 has flow for Oct. 1 (1.459mmbtu).  Deal # 125786 was used for Sept. 2000.  Could you please extend the deal or have a new one created?    Thanks. AL

Purchase Deal #157288 It appears that the price on PGEV should be Index less $.06 not Index less $.05 for the redelivery. Let me know which is correct per the exchange agreement. Thanks- K 
The Cleburne Plant will be down for an outage during the following time period: 9/24  1/2 day 9/25-10/4 entire day So, we will have about 45,000/day to sell.  The supply costs are $2.777 for 25,000 & $2.742 for 20,000. 
Please read the message below.  What do you think about increasing the fee? D 
Darren, How are things going?  Just a note to reiterate what we talked about yesterday.  Rick Hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee was for an outside counterparty.  This admin fee would be for the life of the project (through 2019).   Also, Mike Mazowita should be calling you to talk about the plant being down this week through the end of the month.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks. John 
Well, I got selected.  The judge estimated that we would probably be there through Friday.  I will be in the office each morning until 9:15 and may return some evenings.  If you need anything, you can leave me a voice mail or call Liz and Stacey. 
FYI. I will be out of the office tomorrow, 9/19/00, for jury duty. Please contact Stacey Neuweiler (3952) or Liz Bellamy (6029) if you need anything. 
Kris, Please forward this to the appropriate person. We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) Pipeline.  This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.  Duke (Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 5 months.  The deal in Sitara is #145125.  Please look into this and let me know where we stand. Thanks. 
Nagesh , I would like to have the CPR Position Manager resorted for the TEXASMKT screen as Follows: Houston Pipe Line East Texas Gas Systems NNGB Humble Gas Pipeline Channel Industries Gas Centana Pipeline Oasis Pipeline Comp PG&E Valero PG&E TECO Lone Star Gas Remaining pipelines in alphabetical order.

Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized through legal.  However, we were able to ""get between"" a few deals and make some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with the customers. Buy from Tenaska IV July 399763 Aug 399773 Sell to Tenaska Marketing July 399791 Aug 399797 Sell to ANP Aug 399814 The trading desk these are on is ""ENA-IM Cleburne"". Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany mail.  (I received both invoices this week) I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks. 
Julie, In Sitara, the following purchases expire with no evergreen flag.  Please let me know if this is correct for these contracts. Deal 138094  -  ERAC     expires 10/31/00 Deal 113858  -  Teco Gas Processing     expires 12/31/00 
Per Gas Control, this will be down until the 18th. 
Julie, Please review deal 133010.  The deal shows evergreen, but nothing rolled to September. D 
Daren - can you get a deal set up for meter 6879 for Sept. 00?  There is flow for day 1, it is a 16 day chart.  In Aug. there was a deal of 176 on deal # 133010 for Heatherloch Municipal Utility.  Please let me know if enter a deal.  Thanks. AL 
Mary, You can roll this if you need to.  I usually leave it up to logistics to update the trans usage tickets like this. D Mary Poorman@ENRON 09/13/2000 10:48 AM 
Daren, The above deal is a desk to desk for Amoco gas at Katy, which is xported on ENA's agmt on Tejas.  Please extend the deal to cover September. Thank you, Mary 
Due to the lack of space for the Sitara training, only 4 people can attend from Texas.  I think that it would be most beneficial if the newest members of the group attended this first meeting (Liz, Mary, Susan, and Sabrae). Russ will set up another session at a future date for others (Tom, Eddie, Mark). Let me know if you have any questions. D

Robert, There are three buy back tickets in Sitara for Equistar at mtr 1373.  Two for HPL and one under ENA.  Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company? Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract and HPL contract?

Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created and the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below. Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system (which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would create). Standard Pooling Stations and West Texas (Line X) Pooling Stations had no meters, so they are not set up.  I will try to find the meter numbers for these locations.  I don't think we will be using them much.  So, it may be a few days before I get the info together. The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-8477-01) was previously created as (178477), I need to know if the (01) needs to be added.  Please add the 01. We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).  Is this the same point???  This is the same point. Please let Donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red. Thanks, Faye

You may want to come to this meeting.  When we met with Bob Hall the other dayon OA, I mentioned that you and I should probably be included in the monthly meeting so that we would have an idea of any problems that were occurring each month.  If you have something else going on, don't worry about being there.  I'll relay the info to you. D 
Lee, FYI.  Enron Methanol has been taking about 5,000 swing each day for August. So, I added 5,000 for September (#139057 @ GD) in addition to the 34,000 they nom'd. D 
Enron Methanol nominates the following natural gas requirements for the Methanol Plant for September 2000: 34,000 mmbtu per day EGPFC nominates the following natural gas requirements for the MTBE Plant at Morgan's Point for September 2000: 9,000 mmbtu per day 
Jackie, What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS. D 
You need to path the change at mtr 8055.  You should not path the buyback at mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume.  All other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed with zero volumes.) D 
Please see the attached Tufco file for July.  The 2,500 under the Wagner Brown contract on the 24th has been zeroed out (no flow at LS Katy for that day).  This resulted in a change between contracts/deals on the 31st also. Let me know if you have any questions. D 
These deals should be converted to ENA-IM Texas.  Is there a way that you can change all of these deals systematically? D

No, we have transported on Tejas a few times this year also (on and off). Carlos should be able to tell you when. D Lauri A Allen 08/17/2000 03:27 PM 
Oct 99 Daren- Was 10/99 the only month we transported this Carthage gas on Tejas? 
Oct 99 I phoned Doug Trachta at Tejas regarding this issue.  I appears that nominations were made under ENA's agreement 6520 on Tejas Pipeline Company from Carthage to Indian Hills.  However, both of these points are actually on the Tejas Gas Operating.  ENA doesn't have an agreement to ship on Operating, but HPL does.   I think we need to set up an accounting arrangement to accomodate this deal, it appears as though ENA would be ""piggy-backing"" on HPL's agreement as they actually own the gas.  It appears as though we need to move the volumes from Pipeline to Operating, at the very least.  How have other months been handled with respect to this transport? Please let me know if I may be of any further assistance in resolving this deal. Mary ext. 35251 
I rolled ceal 329242 for Aug 1. D Mary Poorman@ENRON 08/16/2000 04:28 PM

This transport ticket should have been entered under ENA, instead of HPL. However, the pathing in Unify is correct.  HPL sold 30,000 on th 15th to ENA, who then transported it to mtr 628 on Oasis for .015. Daren Enron North America Corp.

Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done. Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going. Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days. D ""buylow"" <buylow@houston.rr.com> on 03/31/2001 02:24:42 AM 
Did you survive bid week? I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff left? Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one) 
I'll be there. 
Just a little explanation on what you're seeing. We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes each day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points. D Enron North America Corp. 
The new fixed price deal with Equistar is #365013. D

John, I need information on the following questions related to Cornhusker: 1)  I understand that we will be handling the invoicing and settlements of the supply, transport, and sales contracts.  Who will be handling the financiol accounting  and reporting for these deals? 2)  Is someone in Legal currently assigning the contracts to ENA? 3)  What is the name of the company purchasing the supply/fuel at the plant? 4)  Tenaska told us that we are supposed to be paying the suppliers and the pipeline for July and August activity.  Is this true?  I thought we weren't taking responsibility for this until September business.  We are not prepared to pay the suppliers for July. 5)  Should these deals be in an accrual or MTM book? Thanks.

B, I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently: 1)  After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to interview her.  Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times, even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.  Pat Clynes fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately called Toni to get it straightened out.  Toni called me at home, which is good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to discuss information with me. 2)  At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.  This has improved over the last week.  She has called me a couple of times awaiting my decision on salary concerns.  So, I think that she is trying to stay on top of this now. Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting. 
FYI 
The term contract with Four Square attached to deal #138049 has been terminated.  Therefore, we need to take that deal to zero for August 2000 forward.  Additionally, we entered into a base load (August only) deal to purchase the gas from Four Star at mtr 6599 (#348446).  The 1,500/day should be schueduled on this deal. Let me know if you have any questions. D

PanEnergy purchase: Deal #231758. Gas in the amount of 271 mmbtus for April 1st was purchased from PanEnergy on deal # 231758 . However, scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day one and as a result, it is not pathed in the system. Could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn't be a sale so that Scheduling can either path April 1st or I can dispute the volume being billed to us by Pan Energy. This is part of Pan Energy's exchange deal. Katherine 5-8643 
Katherine As I  told Thu before (see below), I did not see any volumes for that deal in 4/00. I think this volume is some residue that flow from the last day in March and probably should be allocated to that month. I dont show a deal to purchase or sell that gas in April. If you have any more questions please let me know, thanks. Carlos Katherine Herrera@ENRON 07/20/2000 03:50 PM

Mary, Please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter.  I am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect. In POPS, the estimates vs acutals look odd.

Normally we inactivate old deals on the first Sunday of the month that lies closest to the 10th. The job takes a long time and is run over the weekend. This Sunday (the 8th) we will inactivate all the March deals. This is done to reduce the volume of deals in Sitara so that performance (speed & stability) can be enhanced. The only application that this really affects is Position Manager. Our IT department has asked if they can do this for all the April deals on May 6th next month. Any concerns, please call the Sitara Hotline 853-7049 Thanks GG

During June, Coral transacted on EOL.  However, they selected a July thru October deal by mistake.  The marketer immediately called the desk and we agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a second deal in EOL.  Coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it was unwound.  But, since EOL deals are automatically processed and are firm transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to zero volume and price.  Logistics will be brokering the transactions in MOPS.  Please be sure that Coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals. Again, they will not have a record of the deals. The Sitara deals are: 287946 and 288653. Let me know if you have any questions.

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th. (Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact. Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and schedulers on call. Let me know what you think. 
Wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might involve your desks via EOL in the near future. We already have one in the East.  I stressed to the Sitara/EOL folks the importance of adding comments to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is happening.  One side of these buy/sell or exchange deals will be ratable and the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality.Comments will include the corresponding deal number, that it is in fact a buy/sell or exchange deal and the delivery time period(3,5 or 10 days) that the counterparty desires. I hope this helps...THANKS!

Deal # 157288 Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production. Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract the price for this redelivery point. Thanks Katherine 5-8643 
Beverly, Please include Carlos Rodriguez on the CES e-mails.  He will be handleing the scheduling for us.  Thanks.

Hey, I spoke with Ronnie Skerrik and Charlie Stone this morning and they agreed that if Lonestar does not bring the gas back to HPL as nomed that the gas will continue to be sold to TXU.   This should elevate any higher vol re-deliveries/Make up to HPL. Please call me with any questions, Janet

I have made the changes mentioned below.  I've also adjusted the spreadsheet based on our conversation yesterday.  Take a look at it when you get a chance. D 
We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it. Deal 514353		Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113 Deal 384258		Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11 I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms. I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV. Thanks, Megan 
Bob, I highlghted some changes on your spreadsheet.  Look over these and call me if you have questions.  A couple of the deals have Gas Daily tiers, so I moved them down in the sheet.  I would like for you to make the changes tomorrow after trading. D 
Daren, Please click on the Supply Analysis tab of the attached spreadsheet to view the wellhead volumes through 4/4/01. Bob

This was a weekend deal with Mirant.  On your spreadsheet, the volume shows 4429.  This is also the volume that I confirmed with Mirant.  The deal is in Unify for 5429.  Could you please check and let me know which volume is good. Mike

Rob, I got your name from Doug Leach.  He  thought that you would be the person to talk to about this. I got a call last night from Rudolph Maldonado.  (The operator forwarded him our way.)  He stated that he has some natural gas to sell in Saudi Arabia. His number is 562-866-1755.  Could you give him a call and check this out?  I told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with. I can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions. Daren Farmer

Nagesh , I would like to have the CPR Position Manager resorted for the Texas/HPLC screen as Follows: Houston Pipe Line East Texas Gas Systems NNGB Humble Gas Pipeline Oasis Pipeline Company PG&E Valero PG&E TECO Remaining pipelines in alphabetical order. In addition to this, please sort the location level (zones) under Houston Pipeline as follows: 01-Thompsonville 14-South Texas 02-Robstown 19-King Ranch 11-Corpus 03-A/S South 04-A/S Central 07-A/S East 08-East Texas 15-Katy 16-West Loop 10-Ship Channel Remaining zones in numerical order Let me know if you have any questions or problems.  Thanks. 
I received a call from Jill Zively about our supply at mtr 5999.  Late Friday night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into Midcon instead of HPL.  The nomination into HPL for the 10th through the rest of the month will be 11,300/d.  Jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at Gas Daily.  I changed deal #278748 to reflect this change for Saturday forward.  Since this is priced at Gas Daily, there will be no mark-to-market impact.  We need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume changed and adjust if necessary. 
Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000 forward to deal #292249.  This should help some with amount of time it takes to update and bridge back this deal.  He is adjusting the swap tickets also. You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok. The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time involved in updating the deal. 
In 1925 Houston Pipe Line Company was formed to fuel a growing Houston economy.  Over the past 75 years, we have expanded our physical network across the Texas Gulf Coast, and we now offer a wide range of financial, commodity and risk management services.    HPL is the largest single supplier of gas to Entex and is one of the most flexible intrastate pipeline systems in the country due to our 118 Bcf Bammel Storage field. To celebrate our 75th birthday, I am pleased to invite HPL employees and their spouse or guest to a company-sponsored event on Saturday the 9th of September at Moody Gardens in Galveston, Texas.  The attached invitation provides the details.  Additional information will be sent to you over the summer.  Please mark your calendars with this date, and I look forward to seeing you there.

Attached please find the Activity Survey for the month of May, 2000. I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this month as the ""bar is being raised"" by the management of Energy Operations for data quality and timeliness. The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of day Friday, June 2. Please note the following updates: For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please provide statistics accordingly If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email Jennifer Reside If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction, please call or email Jennifer Reside If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next month, please let Jennifer know. Please contact Jennifer Reside x3-5971 with questions (Shari is on vacation this week), or if you are unable to complete the survey within the allotted time. 
I changed the dates to 1999. D Fred Boas 06/07/2000 10:09 AM 
Daren: Thanks again for your prompt attention to this matter, I appreciate it. There is a slight problem however, I couldn't find the deals for July and November 1999 in Path Manager.  I looked in Sitara and I see where you put the deal 269123 in for May 1999, but it is also in for July and November of 2000.  Did you mean to put the deal in for July and November of 1999 and inadvertently put it in for July and November 2000?  If so would you put it in for July and November 1999 and send me an e-mail when you are done. Thanks, Fred Daren J Farmer 06/06/2000 10:32 AM

I never heard back from Aimee on which Transport contract to attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still allocated to the Strangers Gas contract.  Aimee is out on vacation until mid-June so I put in a call to Daren Farmer to find out which Transport contract I should attach the deal 269123 to. When I find out which transport contract to use I will set up the accounting arrangements and then get Robert Lloyd to put the contract in POPS and reallocate. Fred

BH, Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.  I left the office sooner than planned.  This list is pretty slim.  I spent much time trying to learn to trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing reults for you.  With me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to hire an additional person, this will change.  Let me know if you have any questions on my list of accomplishments. D

Please extend the sale at Lockhart  to Southern Union for two extra days at the same price. Thank you, Janet 
Can you please extend deal #254839 to cover flow for 5/20 and 5/21?  On the 20th, 578 decatherms flowed.  On the 21st, 109 decatherms flowed. Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 
Steve, I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 2000.  Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.  But since our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.  ENA then transports the gas to a delivery point.  If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery point.  This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and completing the scheduling in reasonable time.  Plus, it just doesn't make sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as HPLC.  Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned. Thanks for your help. Daren 
Steve, How are things going with this request? FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA. Thanks. Daren

Daren - Is there a reason there is a nom of 20.000/day at meter 385?  This is a non-allocatable meter. AL 
Bob, Go ahead and accept the nom revision.  I believe that this is with PGE, not El Paso.  How do the rest of our noms compare with EOG?  I f they have a higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom there.  In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as possible to what we have in the system now. D Enron North America Corp. 
You need to get with the East desk on this.  Were they allocated this volume on Tetco?  If so, you can adjust the deal and have the East desk approve it. If they were not allocated this flow, the volume should go on the OBA. D Jackie Young 05/31/2000 08:54 AM

Hey Daren, We're back on this issue again.  There is gas out there for days 1-3 and 6-20 but the deal is only good for 21-31. Can you assist Anita and I w/a deal number to place the 1st 20 days on. Anita is attempting to close this issue. As usual, thanks for your help. -Jackie- 3-9497 
Jackie, We are back on this issue again...........the deal was only good for day 21-31, don't we have to find out who this gas belong's to for days 1-20? Stephanie still thinks this should be for Encina.   Please advice. Thanks Jackie Young 04/03/2000 05:19 PM 
I've just reallocated the meter.........................give a minute 
yes Jackie Young 04/03/2000 05:10 PM 
Daren, The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st thru the 31st to the 215? I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal. Thanks -Jackie- 
Jackie, any luck on the issue w/ the gas allocated to ""stranger's gas"" at this meter.......... 
Let's keep the current noms in the system for now.  After a few days have flowed, we will look at all the wellhead volumes and adjust if needed. D Enron North America Corp. 
The position reports to me and is budgeted. 
Toni, Attached is the job posting for my group.  Please process this as soon as possible.  Thanks. Daren 
June volumes on Tejas are attached. 
I will be out 6/9 on a customer trip (San Antonio with Aquila). I will be on vacation in July from 1st-7th. 
CR and AL, We bought 8000 from Richardson (#245410) at Teco - Lone Star Katy and sold it to Tufco at that point on 5/12/00.  At 3am Tufco cut us on the sale, resulting in only 6,000 flowing to Tufco for the day.  We need to find out what PGE did with the remaining 2,000 we bought from Richardson.  Did they deliverit to us at HPL?  Or did they cut Richardson?  Or, are they showing that we have gas stranded at that point?  Please look into this and let me know. 
AC, You may need to fax a copy of the invitation for the July trip to Tim.  When I talked to him today, he hadn't seen anything.  (My fault, I turned the names in late.)  The real invitaion should be delivered to him soon. D 
Good Afternoon All!! I have attached the invitation to our 8th Annual Enron Customer Meeting to be held at The Don Ce Sar in St. Pete's Beach, FL. Please feel free to fax or email to your customers as you see necessary, but please use the RSVP forms for the trip they will be attending (July or August).   The 'invitation' attachement is generic and should be used for both RSVP forms. The original invitation will be going out in the mail this evening.  with a requested return date of June 8, 2000. If you have any questions or need an assistance, please call me at x33278. Thank you, Heather Choate 
After comparing HPL's numbers with PG&E's numbers I have found a few discrepancies with the Tufco volumes. HPL   PG&E 5/8   137.500   139.583 5/11   103.750   100.833 5/19   108.333   8.333 Days 8 and 11 have small discrepancies.  I got with Carlos on the 5/19 discrepancy.  He checked the numbers sent to him by Tufco.  He verified that it should be 8.333.  I also checked with Steve in Gas Control regarding what flowed for Tufco.  Steve told me 8.300.  I have gone back into MOPS and corrected these volumes.   This should impact the UA4 number.  Also, this decreases the MidTexas cumulative imbalance.  As of 5/23 PG&E owes HPL 4.649.  If you have any questions, please let me know. -Aimee 
HPL is ok. 
Julie, What info do you have on the Praxair deal (#70171)?  Should this be on ENA or HPLC? D Cheryl D King 05/23/2000 09:27 AM Sent by: Cheryl Dudley 
Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.  I have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that Brenda needs.  I am confused about Praxair though. The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99. The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial Agreement. Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If it really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment to HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair. Please advise. Daren J Farmer 05/11/2000 03:11 PM 
Cheryl, The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are: City of Brazoria Central Illinois Light Company D & H Gas Company, Inc. Markham Gas Merit Energy Partners Praxair Reliant Energy - Entex Reliant Energy - HL&P Southern Union Company Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co) Union Carbide Corporation Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.) All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let me know if you need something like that. Let me know if you have any other questions. D Cheryl D King 05/10/2000 08:42 AM Sent by: Cheryl Dudley 
Just to update you on this project's status: Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off of HPL's pipe. Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc. Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc. Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P Central Illinois Light Company  Southern Union Company D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc. Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the above contracts. 
I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for which she is looking. She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is doing off of HPL's pipe. I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will this give me everything that I need? Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  -- ?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara? Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!! Thanks in advance. 
Tom, Please handle this.  The deal is already out there for this time period.  You will probably need to send a zero nom. D 
Daren - During the Saxet Thompsonville outage, May 8 - May 11, the meter flowed a small volume with no nom.  Can you set up a deal for the days that flowed? 5/8 .012 5/9 0 5/10 .087 5/11 6.970 - Aimee

Nagesh, Please resort the pipeline order on the Texas/HPLC position screen in CPR. The current sort makes it difficult for us to manage our trading position each day.  The arrangement  (from the top of the screen to the bottom) that would most benefit us is listed below: Houston Pipe Line East Texas Gas System NNGB Oasis PG&E Valero All remaining pipes listed in alphabetical order by pipe name. Please look into this and let me know of any problems in making these changes. Thanks. Daren

Mike, This is what I was talking about in our staff meeting.  Let me know if you can make this. D 
I've created deal 269123.  The pricing below looks in correct.  I have used 85% of Gas Daily, instead of Gas Daily less 85% (That would only be 15% of Gas Daily.)  Please verify the price and let me know if we need to change the deal ticket.

Hey Mr. D  I see that the  aggregate ( not Aggie) meters need to be trued up,  do you want me to do that or are you.  Let me know if your booked up and I'll help ya out.  TOM. 
Cheryl, The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are: City of Brazoria Central Illinois Light Company D & H Gas Company, Inc. Markham Gas Merit Energy Partners Praxair Reliant Energy - Entex Reliant Energy - HL&P Southern Union Company Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co) Union Carbide Corporation Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.) All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let me know if you need something like that. Let me know if you have any other questions. D Cheryl D King 05/10/2000 08:42 AM Sent by: Cheryl Dudley 
Just to update you on this project's status: Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off of HPL's pipe. Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc. Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc. Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P Central Illinois Light Company  Southern Union Company D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc. Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the above contracts. 
I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for which she is looking. She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is doing off of HPL's pipe. I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will this give me everything that I need? Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  -- ?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara? Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!! Thanks in advance. 
I have created deal 266962 for the volumes at mtr 6757. What price is Duke reporting for the mtr 5192 volumes?  The only activity we've had out there is payback with Koch. D Aimee Lannou                05/09/2000 03:30 PM 
Daren - Have you had a chance to look at this? - Aimee 
Daren - Can you set up new deals for meter 6757 and 5192?

There is flow for May, July and Nov. 99. Will you please let me know if you set up new deals for these meters? Thanks. Aimee 
Aimee: The Crow O'Connor, meter 6757 has its gas allocated to Strangers Gas for April and May 1999 and Duke has been calling Settlements asking for their money.  I will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter for these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and valid deal # for this transaction. In addition, the Sarco Lateral, meter 5192 has its gas allocated to Strangers Gas for May and July 1999 and Duke has been calling Settlements asking for their money.  I will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter for these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and valid deal # for this transaction. I would like to get this done ASAP since the customer is calling Settlements and we start close next week. Thanks, Fred 
That works for me. D Enron North America Corp. 
Tom, Let's leave everything as it is currently and review the meters in a couple of days to see if the increases actually occur. D Tom Acton@ENRON 05/10/2000 10:40 AM 
Daren,  Shore line would like to take meter 9781 from 460 to 1  for the 11 th gas day.  It flowed the nom for April so they must be having well problems this month.  Meter 9680 has a change from 739 to 1200.  It flowed in the 700 for April .  Could be new production coming on behind the meter. Texaco would like to change meter 9826 from 1201 to 1500 for the rest of the month.  In April they flowed from 1000 to 1300. 
That's fine. D Tom Acton@ENRON 05/09/2000 08:43 AM 
Shoreline wants to increase the volume at  meter 9830 for the 10th gas day. This is a new meter so there is not much history to it.  They want to go from 535 to 750.  last month it flowed in the upper 500's  but it didn't come on till the 21st of the month.

Bob, On the Texas desk, the majority of our deals are nominated manually (on Excel or preprinted forms), with most of the information pulled from Sitara instead of Unify.  So, these noms were not late.  For a couple of 3rd party pipelines, we do use Unify.  But we did not have nom changes for 5/4.  Our only problem was sending noms to HPL.  Which is sending information to yourself, but it still delays the confrimation process for the pipeline. This nom was sent about 30 minutes late.  Let me know if you have any questions. Daren 
Please provide Bob Superty with a list of pipelines whom were late or had nomiation issues as a result of this mornings Unify problems.

Daren- Please enter Texas purchase from Cannon Interest and a Texas sale to the Storage Book in the sitara. George and Aimee-  Please coordinate with Daren so your entries are entered on the same day. Mary- The contract agreement, I assume, is already in place. Lisa, Rita, & Stephanie-  Please be sure the payment of  $2,428,130.32 is wired to Cannon Interest @ the corrected ABA on May 20th. If I missed anyone who needs this information, please forward it. Thanks, Kenny 
Mike, What is the status of the list we compiled a few months ago?  I had a few items on that list, but I can't remember the details now.  Since I don't deal with Unify as much as I used to, the only thing that I can remember is: We need to add a column with the initials of the schedulers responsible for each meter. 
Yes, Who is this? SPIWAREHOUSE@cs.com on 04/27/2000 03:59:58 PM 
Hey Daren, Is this your e-mail address?????? 
I've changed the deal to 1 for the rest of this month and for May. d Aimee Lannou                04/25/2000 12:14 PM 
Daren - Have you had a chance to check this out?  I know you are busy.  At least we can get a head start on May. - Aimee 
Daren - Meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom.  This meter is has been over nominated.  It has had a nom of 1.000/day (429.000 total mmbtus) since 1/28/99 and has flowed only 11.692.  Am I correct to say that this meter needs a lower nom?  Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom in May.  Pat seems to think this may be affecting the P/L for April.  We only have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2. Please let me know if this makes sense. - Aimee 
Go ahead and make those changes. D Tom Acton@ENRON 04/20/2000 07:02 AM

March 2000 Daren - Would there be a problem if I created a desk to desk for meter 378 for  March 2000 going forward?  It would help out with the allocation process.  The kind of deal I need is the total opposite of deal # 115101. Please let me know if there is a problem. Volume management would like this done today.  Thanls. - Aimee 
March 2000 Aimee: The ENA 012-27049-02-002 and HPL 012-41500-02-016 contract are not at Meter 378 for March 2000.  I need for you to put the correct deal number for both contracts in Path Manager.

March is consistent with Feb. Shari Mao 03/31/2000 12:22 PM 
As you are aware, we are starting to collect data for our March price model. I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your costs from the activities to the commercial teams.  In the 'Data' tab, please select the your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver survey with March numbers for your RC by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data, please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list beginning next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next month, please let me know. Please take this opportunity to verify the following: 1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to perform these activities for each commercial team. 2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified (please let us know otherwise) 3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example ""Allocate 0469"" or ""80-20 Split""), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new allocation is). In reference to these surveys, please note: If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly among these teams. The costs for ""commercial team specific"" activities that you filled time out for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco). Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey. Regards, Shari 3-3859 
Shari Mao 03/31/2000 11:44 AM 
Hello, We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a completed ""Hours"" survey for each position within your group.  This survey will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the month of March. NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can add the appropriate activities to your survey. To fill out the survey: At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled ""Select Your RC"". Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits. Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message ""Select Position from Drop Box!"" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, specialist, etc.) and ""OK"". The choices for positions are based on information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity listed in the column labelled ""Hours"". If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position. If you do not, the information will be lost. We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two

Have you asked Karry Kendall about this meter? Jackie Young 04/12/2000 02:38 PM 
Daren, Is Fred's below concern something that you might be able to help us with?  I was thinking that (maybe) the volumes from this meter might belong to HPL. This is one of the meters that no longer go thru King Ranch. Thanks -Jackie- 
Jackie: Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract 012-41970-02-002 in March 2000.  Also last month when you were out, Robert removed the volume from the Liquids contract at this meter and temporarily put it on a Strangers Gas contract.  If you could fix both months today and let me know when it is corrected  I would appreciate it. Thanks, Fred Fred Boas 02/16/2000 04:35 PM 
Jackie: I am new at the 3 Rivers allocation so bear with me, I took this over from Anita Luong.  In January 2000, and going forward, please make sure that Meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the HPL Liquids contract 012-41970-02-002.  The contract is currently out of balance by the total volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning I would appreciate it. Thanks, Fred

Mtr 1600- A deal already exists for this meter (#159194).  If you view the meter in MOPS you can see the deal.  (It had zero volume before today.) Mtr 6725 - This gas is traded on the spot market, so there is no deal to put in. D Jackie Young 04/06/2000 10:15 AM 
Daren, I hate to be a pest but here's the deal on the above two meters: 98-1600  Sitara deal #159194 expired on 2/29/2000.  The flow for 2/2000 was on the 215K.  This meter (del.) flowed 53.863 for 3/2000.  There is no   new deal referenced, nor is the evergreen flag in effect. 98-6725  Sitara deal #214948 expired 3/27/2000.  No evergreen and no new deal referenced.  This is a little premature but this meter is active   monthly and I'm thinking that it will flow for this month with no K being applied. Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 
Mtr 1534 - I created deal 238899 for 3/2-31/00 and #238900 for Apr. Mtr 6725 - This meter is traded daily (spot) so, we can't extend the deal. When Elsa gets back next week, I will check with her to see if she did a deal with Encina on this day. D Jackie Young 04/05/2000 04:04 PM 
98-1534 is on the 215K for 3/2000 but is only good for 3/1 - 3/1 in Sitara, on deal #163005.  Can you see if it is o.k. to extend the deal for the rest of the month?  It has flow every day after the 1st. 98-6725 is also on the 215K for 3/2000.  The Sitara deal # is 214948 and covers every day except for day 16.  Can you also see if it is o.k. to extend the deal to cover this day? Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497

Just kidding.  That would not be a problem.  Do I need to give a review of our earlier Sitara training also?  Let me know what you want. D 
No, I don't want to.

The Settlement Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this change should flow smoothly.

Daren, The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st thru the 31st to the 215? I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal. Thanks -Jackie- 
Jackie, any luck on the issue w/ the gas allocated to ""stranger's gas"" at this meter.......... 
utilization - revised 
The deal for March was actually #210507.  I rolled it for one day. D Jackie Young 04/03/2000 12:04 PM 
Daren, Can you please see if you can roll deal 156657 for day 1 for April? This deal expired 3/2000.  There was no new deal # referenced nor was the evergreen flag applied. This meter flowed 556 MMBTU's on April 1, 2000. Thanks -Jackie- 3-94987 
Is this still outstanding?  Craig is back in the office now. D Julie Meyers 03/20/2000 02:27 PM 
Don't we have an OBA at this point now? D Jackie Young 03/31/2000 09:15 AM 
Daren, I know it's first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3/15 (71 dec.) and 3/23 (35 dec.) but the deal (Sitara #213005) doesn't cover these two days. Can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in Sitara so that I can clear my exceptions for Volume Management? Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 
For volumes in excess of the 60,000 on our term agreement which were redelivered to HPL at Mobil Beaumont, we agree to pay Inside Ferc HSC-.045 for the month of March.  The price at which HPL delivered the gas at Eastrans remains at Inside Ferc HSC-.04. Daren Farmer ""Bruce McMills"" <bmcmills@duke-energy.com> on 03/06/2000 10:49:59 AM 
Our nomination into Eastrans is 75,000 MMBtu for 3/7/2000. Redeliveries 7,000 MMBtu from FCV 50,000 into PG & E 3,000 at Carthage 15,000 at Mobil Beaumont Per Brian Riley, the price for the incremental 15,000 above  60,000 will be per our Transaction Agreement, (i.e., PanEnergy purchases 15,000 MMBtu at 1st of Month HSC - $.04 and sells to HPL 15,000 at Monthly HSC - $.0375. Please confirm the incremental 15,000 transaction. Thanks. 
For April, We agree to nominate 60,000 into Eastrans.

Redeliveries: 50,000 MMBtu/d into PG & E 7,800 from Fuels Cotton Valley 17,200 to HPL at Carthage Currently, since 3/22/2000, we have been at 75,000 with the following redeliveries: 43,482 MMBtu/d into PG & E 7,000 from Fuels Cotton Valley 3,000 into HPL Cartwheel 21,518 to Mobil Beaumont I previously showed 44,382 MMBtu/d since 3/22 .  Is 43,482 right? There is no change in deliveries and redeliveries for tomorrow, but could someone clarify what the nominations are on the redelivery side? 
Were these deals confirmed?  What are the pipes and contracts? D 
Daren, Do you have any information on these deals?  We cannot collect the cash from Midcon if we can't prove to them the deals are valid. Thanks, Kris Tina Valadez 03/29/2000 09:19 AM 
Pat Dresner (accountant) at Midcon Texas says she does not show these deals in her system and she can not pay on them.  You created the deals in Sitara and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someone at KN should tell their accountant about the deal. Prod Mo.

Daren,  When is the drop dead date for the spot tickets for the first of the month from Vance Wed. or Thur. 
No, deal 156071 is good for days 7-29. 
Daren, There are only two deals on PGEV pipeline: Deal #156071- valid 02/01/00 - 02/29/00, and Deal # 208083 - valid for 02/01/00 - 02/06/00.  Should there be another deal for days 7-29??  Thanks Thu Daren J Farmer 03/23/2000 11:19 AM 
The actuals should be allocated to the new ticket which has been nom'd, tracked. and balanced. D 
The actuals should be allocated to the new ticket which has been nom'd, tracked. and balanced. D 
We do not have deal to enter for this.  You need to look at the entire Midtex line for each of the days that are out of balance.  If we are short at Katy, I would think that we would be long at Dewville.  (Many times, our receipts from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the Tap.)  This should help you fix the January problem.  Also, for December, you may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.  Is it at HPL Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex line?  In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.  The only other remedy is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance. D Aimee Lannou                03/22/2000 01:24 PM 
Daren - can you set up a delivery deal for meter 8740 for Jan 00 and Dec. 99?   I checked OSS and there is an 089 operational contract that took the swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom.   Third party contracts are supposed to stay whole.  Days 12-14 did not flow enough to cover the noms for Western.  We have the same problem on Jan. 25.  Please let me know, Brenda Herod would like this resolved today, as would I. - Aimee 
Stacy- Can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for Dec. 99.  The problem with this meter is,  all third party transports should stay whole and HPL takes the swing.  Several days the meter did not flow enough and the third parties did not receive all of their gas.  I need a delivery set up so the 3rd parties will stay whole.  If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks. - Aimee 
The Methanol Plant went down about 5 a.m. today.  It is expected to be down until late Friday, March 24. 
Dan, ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines (listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can. Thanks. Daren

I have extended deal 151669 to cover mtr 9676 for Feb and Mar. D Jackie Young 03/11/2000 12:19 PM 
Robert, I've taken care of 98-6719 (as far as getting it out of my allocation exception screen).  I'm going to place 98-9676 on Strangers Gas until you hear back from Daren or Julie. Should Daren or Julie get back w/you, while I'm on vacation, please get back w/Anita Luong and provide her with the K # given to you (by Daren or Julie) as well as the dates of 2/1 - 2/29 (even though 3/1/2000 is reflected in my allocation exception screen) so that she can provide you with an accounting arrangement to place February's volumes on @ this meter. It looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3/1/2000.  I guess that the trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter. Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 
I extended the deal at mtr 6719 to include 2/10.   In the future, please run all wellhead deals through Tom Acton first. I've got a message into Julie Meyers to look into the contract at meter 9676, and will let you know what she determines. D Jackie Young 03/10/2000 10:39 AM 
Hi Daren, Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me? 98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal is not effective until  February the 11th. No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the gathering (96026573) K which is the only K @ the meter. 98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is flow for all of February 2000 with no K.

This deal was done with Greg Stockard. D Julie Meyers 03/13/2000 04:31 PM 
Daren: You put this in, do have a clue? Julie 
George, Are you looking into these variances? D 
The Cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to Cilco.  Please review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.  The biggest variance is in January 2000.  Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel. Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel. --------------------- Lisa Kinsey 03/21/2000 08:12 AM 
Kenny, Attached is the worksheet that I have been using to verify Cilco's storage balance with Vonda Seckler from Cilco.  Let me know if you need anything else. Lisa Kinsey ext 37628 
ATEs is incorrect.  There should not be a specialist in my group. D Shari Mao 03/20/2000 04:43 PM 
Daren, ATEs shows that your team has one specialist for 1497 in January and February.  Please let me know if ATEs is incorrect for the month of January and February.  If there is a specialist in your team, we have not received a survey from this person.  This lack of information prevents your expenses from being 100% allocated out to the commercial teams.

Stacy,  Bill Moore from Texaco called and the well at meter 9826 which came on at the beginning of the month at 2,000 a day  has dropped of to 1,200 a day.   Bill would like to change the nom to 900 so we balance for the month. Let me know what you think and I'll get back with him.

Hey Ken, Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you, but...We've had an interesting couple of weeks here.  Craig Faulbaum has taken personal some time off (I think that this is the 4th week).  So, we have picked up his trades.  Tom restructured the EOL trading.  Carey has gone to Gas Daily and I have taken over the Waha trading for an interim period.  (I'm still responsible for our overall position, but Ami is watching it during trading.)  In other words, everyone on my desk is doing double duty.  And, of course, Tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps (not cracks, anymore). He has two opening on the trading side that we (Stacey and I) are filling.  I don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet.  I am getting very frustrated with the whole business.  It doesn't see that he even appreciates the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack. Wheww...That feels a little better... getting some of that off my chest. Anyway, Tonya is very uncomfortable.  I think that baby is going to come along any day now (due date is still 3/18).  We are both definitely ready. The desk is really going to be in a fix when I'm out with that.  That's just too bad.  (I half expect Tom to ask me to come in some.  I've got a real quick answer to that.) How are things at home?  Linda doesn't have you working too much does she?  I just bought the materials to put a sprinkler system in our front yard.  If things get weak on your stock trading, I've got some trenches you can dig for extra cash!  It shouldn't be too bad, I bought a brand new sharp-shooter. (Of course with a new shovel, I'd have to knock some off of your hourly pay.) The grant price on the employee options is $55.50. I hope everything is going good for you.  I would like to have lunch with you sometime.  I will let you know when things work out here, so that we can do that.  Or...I can give you a call when I'm out for paternity leave and we can go one day then.  Talk to you later. 
I extended both deals. D Jackie Young 03/06/2000 11:20 AM 
Daren, I'm attempting to clean up my allocations, due to this being allocation close week for Volume Management. 98-1534 (delivery meter) overflowed into March, day 1 only,  for .30 decatherms (Sitara Deal #163005 - Start date 2/1/2000  and stop daate 2/29/2000).  The 215K is the only one at this meter for Feb. 2000 production.  I don't see a new Sitara deal number being referenced nor do I see the evergreen flag applied here.  Please apprise if you can extend the ticket for this small amount for 3/1/2000 or if you want it handled differently. 98-1052 (delivery meter), allocated flow for 2/21-2/24/2000 with no K applied.    Days 22 and 23 for February references the 215K (Sitara Deal #168884 start date 2/22/2000 stop date 2/23/2000.  Sitara deal #201636 has the same start and stop date as 168884 and neither references an evergreen flag or a new deal number). Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497

This was a late Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in POPS, the gas was scheduled on the stranger's gas contract.  However, deal ticket #143709 was never updated to reflect those late changes.  Please let me know if you want me to update the deal ticket.  Thanks, Susan.

I have identified the additional HPLC wellhead purchases and have made corrections to the interconnect tickets accordingly.  Jackie is still having difficulty identifying all the wellhead purchase.  We feel there are at least 6 meters flowing a total of appox. 7000 a day that are not showing up on a HPLC purchase or a HPLR transport.  I believe she has given you this information and will await instructions or for the purchases to be input reflecting the proper Enron Entity purchasing these volumes. We have worked very hard on this issue and I apologize that it has not yet been entirely corrected.

Can you please extend sitara deal #156657 for 3/1/00, if the deal will allow?  It was transported on the 215K, which was the only one out there for 2/00. It spilled over into March on day 1 for .423 dec. Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 
In February, 539,594 Mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from HPLR Liquids at King Ranch.  This allocation resulted in a large physical unaccounted for loss.  Effectively, the gas was being purchased twice in our systems.  In addition, a sale to the Liquids group, which should have been zero, was brokered with a purchase from Swift (2500 Mmbtu/day), resluting in additional gas being allocated to the HPLR Liquids purchase contract.  I have attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in February.  This schedule also reports the daily volumes for March which will need to be adjusted.  I have calculated (based on estimates) that we should have only purchased about 88,000 from the Liquids group at King Ranch for February.  See the following: Booked to HPLR Liquids: 539,574  18,606/day Purch by HPLC @ WH:  379,108  13,073/day Incorrect Liquids Sale:    72,500  2,500/day Adjusted purch from Liquids:   87,986  3,034/day We usually input a purchase of 2,500 Mmbtu/day from HPLR Liquids at the tailgate.  We can increase this to 3,000/day for March. The majority of gas in the 3-Rivers system is transported to the King Ranch plant through HGPL.  Some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLC, some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLR Liquids, and three producers have the option to either sell their gas to HPLC at the wellhead or to process their gas and sell the residue to HPLC at the tailgate of the plant.  It is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated correctly among parties related to these transactions.  The attached schedule should assist in doing this.  I have reported the meters at which HPLC buys wellhead gas.  The movement of this gas through HGPL and King Ranch should be kept seperate from the gas purchased by the Liquids group.  A transport usage ticket can be used to show the transfer of HPLC's gas from King Ranch to HPL. Let's plan on discussing this either Friday or Monday afternoon.  Let me know what works best for you. D 
FYI 
Heidi, yes let's check the rates on the transport usage tickets.  Daren, is supportive of this decision.  Thanks, Mary Enron North America Corp. 
I made the following industrial changes for March 3rd: Chevron  decreased to 9500/day.  This should remain for the rest of the month. Lyon-Citgo increased to 34,000.  This is an increase of 10,000 that will need to be rolled daily until further notice. Shell Cogen increased by 5,000 to 45,000.  This will need to be rolled daily until further notice. Let me know if you have any quesitons. 
Do you mean 12,000 at 6789?  If so that's fine.  Go ahead and bring the Yates down also. D Tom Acton@ENRON 03/02/2000 04:00 PM 
Daren , I think I may have lost my mind ( no comment Vance) but did I talk to you about meter 6789 taking that volume from 12079 to 1200.  Also Yates has averaged around the 3366 that they want to bring the volume down to. Let me know what you think.  Husker TOM. 
It's fine with me to allocate everything to Torch if they are paying for it. D Kimberly Vaughn 03/01/2000 04:51 PM 
Daren..  Have you had a chance to look at this yet? 
Tom, For the EOG piece, bring the nom down to 4400 through the 7th.  For the 8th forward, leave the nom as is.  When we get more information next week, we can adjust as necessary. Yates - What did they produce in Jan and Feb?  Let me know that and we can decide if we want to adjust the nom. Vintage - Adjust our nom to tie with Vintage. Tom Acton@ENRON 03/02/2000 10:12 AM 
Daren,  EOG  is having problems with that same well 6296 but this time it's compressor problems.  They think that it will be for at least a week but you know how that goes.  They would like to drop the volume again to 4400.  If we change don't Kim will have an imbalance at this meter (she wanted me to let you know that).  Meter # 6598 YATES  would like to change the volume from 4206 to 3366, and Vintage who had been over producing last month would like to increase from 270 to 320 to match the real flow.  I know these are bothersome changes but I'm trying to get the best numbers for both you and 
That's fine.  Go ahead and change the deal if you need to. D Tom Acton@ENRON 03/02/2000 10:22 AM 
Dallas at meter 986789 would like to decrease from 12079 to 12000. Let me 
Also... What is the Enron dress code?  Do my clothes have to match?   I don't think I've really ever had a professional image.  Do I have to shave?  I don't think I've ever been anywhere on time.  This whole meeting thing is going to be difficult for me.  Just thought you needed to know. D 
Do I need to bring a pen and paper?  Is that considered ""professional""?  I think it would be more impressive if you were taking my notes.  Let me know what you think. D 
Tom, Go ahead and make these changes in Sitara. Thanks. D Tom Acton@ENRON 02/29/2000 04:55 PM 
Daran,  We have a few volume changes for the 1st of March,  first EOG has changed there volume for the gas at meter 6296 from 11,036 to 7100.  I  ran into Laurie Allen in the hall and she said we were heavy there and  that she would visit with you abut it.   The second one is Cokinos, they  will not confirm the volume at meter 9656.  We have 922 and they want that they want 950.  I looked up there nom and that is what they asked for.  Not much of a change.  Last is the one that you faxed down to me this mornings.  Basin Exploration wants to drop there nom due to well problems from 896 to 1.  for the whole month.  Let me know what you think and I'LL get after it.  Tom Cat !!! 
THis is to nominate 65,000 MMBtu/d for 3/1 from HPL to Eastrans. 7,000 MMBtu will come from Fuels Cotton Valley. 58,000 MMBtu will be delivered to PG & E. 
Robert, Ken developed an industrial report before he left.  It can be found at o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly/...  There is one file for each month of 2000.  I need you to update this for March.  This will need to be distributed to Gas Control, Logistics, and myself.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
Brenda, I may be involved in an options training class 2/28-3/7 from 4:30-6:30 each evening.  This is mandatory for the commercial guys, and Tom is trying to get me in also. D 
The purchase from Swift was shown at mtr 3405 during Dec and Jan.  I have created a new deal (#204777) to add mtr 9643 to the deal. Deal 114096 is the purchase from HPLR Liquids.  This purchase is on 138544 for Jan 2000 forward. D 
I know we transported on Midcon due to problems with the plant at the point. I am not sure about the rate. D Lauri A Allen 02/24/2000 02:52 PM 
Do you guys agree with the rate? 
Midcon is billing us $.05 from Katy to Cogen. Lauri A Allen 02/24/2000 01:57 PM 
Kellie- I researched the statements you sent me and found deal ticket #109925 in Sitara which shows HPLC transporting on Midcon from Live Oak to Hardy Street for $.04/mm for the months of August and September. The statement for November covers gas moving from Katy tailgate to Cogen Lyondell and is covered by Sitara deal ticket #133257.  The deal ticket shows a zero rate, however.  Elsa/Daren- do either of you remember this deal?  It was on November 30th for 5000mm.  Kellie- what is Midcon charging for this haul? Thanks. 
FYI,  I was watching the position manager for ENA and noticed some business transactions on this pipeline.  This pipeline was bought by Duke Energy Field Services effective 8/1/99.  All HPLC transactions were moved to that pipe at that time.  The CES transactions that are current on this pipe should be moved to Duke Energy Field Services.  I believe the pipe was renamed when they bought it back in June or July. If you have any questions, or want to verify this information, I would check with the Global contracts dept. 
FYI...this well should come on the 1st week of March, but does have gas daily mid month pricing for the first month. Thanks. SUSAN SMITH 02/22/2000 01:44 PM

Please let me know if you need any additional information. Susan Smith x 33321 
Bruce, I need to hold the deliveries to 60,000 for 2/24.  I'm somewhat limited on my transport right now.  I will look into the possibility of increasing the volume, though.  If you can increase the deliveries at Fuels Cotton Valley, that will work. Daren ""Bruce McMills"" <bmcmills@duke-energy.com> on 02/23/2000 09:11:07 AM 
I meant 2/24/2000 as the effective date of this nom. 
Please incerease deliveries to Eastrans to 65,000 MMBtu/d eff 2/23/2000. 7,000 will come from Fuels Cotton Valley. Maintain sale of 500 MMBtu/d. Increase PG & E nom to 58,000 MMBtu/d. The agreement provides for up to 60,000 MMBtu at our option. Brian Riley needs to approve the increase to 65,000 MMBtu/d. 
Got your message.  Jo won't have your tax figured out until we get the Langston #.  But, she will be able to give you an idea soon.  The curtains do look good.  We are going to have to get a shade to use also, though.  The sun and lights come through pretty bright.  Gotta go.

Rita and Lisa, Why don't ya'll get together and determine a range of days/times that would work for your groups to have a training session.  (Over lunch or early afternoon)  If you are interested, I would like to discuss how we operate the HPL system and the processes we go through during the trading day.  To help with the discussion, I have maps which highlight the main points and areas where we transact.  (There will be a few for you to keep at the desks.) I did this with the Logistics group.  I think it went pretty well.  If you want to do this, we need to allow 1.5 to 2 hours to talk about everything. Let me know. 
As discussed in our 3-Rivers/King Ranch meeting, I have set up purchases from the liquids group and the other 3rd parties at HGPL mtr 0012.  Due to bridgebacks, I had to create new deal numbers for the days prior to 2/16/99. (I went back to Dec 1999, in case it is needed.)  Please see the deal #s below. Teco  113858 &169759 HPLR Liquids  114099 & 169765   (existing deal to cover excess residue) Swift  93779 & 169761 ERAC  138094 & 169760 Tejones 133173 & 169762 Mandy - I understand that you will be setting up the buy and sale with HPLR Liquids to cover the transport on HGPL.

Thu, You need to get with Aimee and George on this. D 
Tom, Go ahead and increase the nom. D Tom Acton@ENRON 02/17/2000 08:18 AM 
Daren do you want to bump that volume up per the information in this note below.  George wanted to know and asked me.  It was previously nomed at 200. Let me know what you think and I'll make the change if needed. 
George- In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month. Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King Ranch. Thanks.

I would like to talk about what we can do to make sure that effective training occurs in the future for new hires/transfers.  For example, we are giving an HPL training session today.  We should not have to give another full blown session in the future.  The group should be able to take this knowledge, add to it, and pass it on to others entering the group.  With the rate of turnover we have experienced in the past, it seems like some knowledge has been lost. 
Stella and Charlotte, I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy should have been found before we closed out January. I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS). This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group, who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas was confirmed for the 27th-31st. Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the OBA.  Unless you can find a missing transport contract. D 
Mom, That sounds good.  You can bring the curtains when you come.  What time do you think you can make it down here on Friday?

Tom, I changed the meter on deal 156161 from7012 to 7341.  You will need to repath and renom this in MOPS.  Also, you will need to make sure that the welhead meteres are linked to 7341 in POPS.  Let me know if you have any questions. D Tom Acton@ENRON 02/09/2000 08:41 AM 
Daren,   I just talked to Mary and she said that they developed the meter 987341 for the meters that you had nominated under the 987012.   Under Aggregate 7012 is 4045;  6026; 6114; 6427; 6848; 9755 ;  these should all be under the 987341.  Do we need to renominate these meters or do I just move them in pops.  Let me know Daren  I aim to please ( I think that's a southern term!!)

Daren - Can you set up a deal for the Cilco withdrawal for Dec. 99 going forward?  I know a deal has never been set up for this but volume management wants a deal set up so they won't have to set up an accounting arrangement evey month.  Please let me know, I'd appreciate it. Thanks. Aimee 
Please plan on attending a training session over lunch on Tuesday, Feb 15th. (Lunch will be provided.)  I intend to discuss the operations of Houston Pipe Line;  how gas is moved through the system, where our main supply and market areas are, locations of specific points, etc.  We will be using a map of the pipeline as the basis for the discussion.  So, come to the meeting with any questions you have on HPL, anything is fair game. Yvette is currently working on securing a room.  I will let you know when that is finalized.

Howard, The Park  and Ride deals should be booked to a transport contract.  Desk to desk deals should be on the transport contract also. D Howard B Camp 01/27/2000 10:17 AM 
Daren, Just a quick note to follow up on UA4 issues. For desk to desk deals, we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not a Co 16 contract with Co 16 and attaching an ECT transport contract to the backscreen. On Park and ride deals, I am under the impression that the Park and ride deal would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a subsequent month. If this is true, was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous Co 89 entry.  I am not sure whether an ECT transport should be attached.  I hope you have some insight on this issue. Let me know HC 
Mike, Thursday the 17th at 1:00 wil work for me.  I have reserved room 3125b.  We can meet at my desk (3138C) and walk over there.

I've extended the deal for the rest of the year, with a -0- nom. D Aimee Lannou                02/03/2000 03:09 PM 
Daren - Deal # 97929, meter 1450 expired Nov. '99.  Is there a way for you to extend the deal or create a new one since there seems to be a little bit of flow each month? - Aimee 
Aimee: There is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month.  The reason for the error is that the deal, # 97929 has expired.  Please determine if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it? To fix this I will set up an accounting arrangement but what I need from you is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to put the deal on. Thanks in advance for your help, Fred 
Hey, Mom.  I got your message.  Just send the curtains whenever you get the chance.  Jo went to the doctor yesterday and everything is looking good.  She is going to start going to the doctor weekly.  Carrying the baby pretty low, so he's getting ready.  Jo thinks he'll be coming around the first part of March, the doctor didn't say that, though.  Anyway, tell Lacy ""Good Luck"".  I love ya'll. 
I can meet anytime Monday afternoon.  I can meet after 4:00 on Tuesday, but not at 1:00. D

Daren, Wanted to let you know that there are still two sitara deals that need to have the expected volume brought down to ""0"" of the list that I previously sent you. They are 114099 and 92918. I appreciate you revising the ones that you have and you probably were going to handle the above two today.  In case you were please disregard this notice.  If you had fogotten, this can serve as reminder. As usual, thanks for your help. -Jackie- 3-9497 
Ami, Please attend this. D 
I wanted to let you know about this meeting in case you wanted any of your schedulers to attend. Thanks Tricia 
If you currently have any Kerr McGee production on your pipe, please plan to attend the meeting today in room 30C1 at 1:30. This should be a very quick meeting.  We will be discussing everyone's roles and responsibilities in maintaining the Kerr McGee tickets in Sitara. I realize we are dealing with numerous cuts and renoms during the day, but if at all possible, please try to attend.  We need to clarify some issue immediately to avoid confusion in the future.

I have scheduled a separate meeting Tomorrow from 2-3.  So exclude that time from our possible meeting times. D 
I can meet tomorrow from 1pm-3pm or Thusday after 1pm. D 
Daren, I apoligize for the late notice.  I didn't realize that we would need your help until this morning.  Please let me know the time that is convenient for you (tomorrow ?) and I will schedule another meeting.  We need to discuss the purchase deals on MidTex Pipeline, at meters 0393 and 0391 (HPL's meter#s). The first deal is with Etoco, original deal 44829 (12/98-12/99), which has been moved to 133435 for Jan 2000 and going forward.  The second meter has desk-to desk deals starting Jan 99 to present.  These deals need to be scheduled on MidTex meters instead of HPL's meters. Thu 3-7159 
Jackie and Stella, I need ya'll to get together and work out how to handle this at Stratton.  I know that we get the estimated volume from Exxon daily and I would think that this volume will need to be allocated among the different deals.  But, Exxon will not have them broken out.

Thu, I would be happy to join you in these type of meetings, but I can never meet before 11:00.  We begin trading each day at 8:30 am. D 
Can we start this meeting later?  We will be trading until 10:30.  Since Greg McClendon is out of the office, Carey Metz is trading basis for him.  Because Carey is doing that, Stacey is needed to trade Waha.  And she is my backup on managing our position.  So, I need to be on the desk during trading. Daren

Daren, The above meter began flow on 1/25/00 w/a volume of  295 decatherms versus the start date of the 26th as indicated on Sitara deal ticket 148923. Can you please notify me as to whether the deal ticket will reflect this change? Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 
FYI.  We need to make sure that this kind of communication conitinues to flow downstream. D 
Deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of January 20. The customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned turnaround. It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown. Please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer. Thanks

Here is a followup to the memo sent on 12/31/99.  FYI Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get this assigned?  I can find old notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?  We no longer do business on Enron Field Services. Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved  We should have a sale to Entex.   The deal will be enrtered in Sitara. MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved We have a sale on ECT to Entex in Sitara. Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here: 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately.  Someone needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified. 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot allocate was is not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?  Carlos is looking into this. 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved  Carlos nom'd this to Channel.  He knows the contract and rate (negotiated by Elsa). HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return. I haven't had time to do this yet.  If we haven't figured out the assignement then I will get to it asap. 
Aimee, I assume that you are looking into this. D

Please forward to logistics in your region...... Would any of the desks be opposed to enabling Unify to default the Destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the Source rankings.  There would still be the ability to change to ranking on the Destination side however, it would not  affect the rankings on the Source side.  This will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry errors.   Would you please forward comments to your manager.    Dave Nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to find out if it would be something worth putting into production. Thanks.

Hey, I think that we are coming in this weekend.  We are only going to be there through Sat nite though.  See you then. 
So, is this ok now? D 
Sherlyn, The base purchase should be brokered with the base sale.  Deal 135563 does not replace the basse purchase ticket, it is in addition to that one.  On the days where deal 135563 is applicable, the purchases and sale should balance out;  no flow. D 
Daren, Is this a buy/sell?   If not what transport contract do I use?  I also see a deal 135563 purchasing from Phillips.  This new deal is not to replace that one is it?   I just  noticed it was for 6000/day. Thanks. Daren J Farmer 01/10/2000 04:51 PM 
At Sweeney (Mtr 1517), for December, 6,000/day was confirmed to the Phillips sale.  Acutally, we should have nominated a purchase of 4,000 and a sale of 10,000.  The original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date. So, I have created deal 148851.  Please reallocate mtr 1517 with these changes; sale of 10,000 on deal 93804, purchase of 4,000 on 148851.  If you have any questions, let me know. D

I have greatly benefited from your knowledge of the market and industry; and also from your experience of just dealing with people and issues.  It has been very nice having someone to discuss ideas with and to learn from (and argue with!).  Thanks, also, for your honesty and openness.  I really appreciate you telling me when you disagree, it helps me see things from a different view.  (I just want to do the best thing for our business, and you help me to do that.)  You don't try to slip anything by, and you take responsibility for your work/actions.  That's hard to find these days.  I just wanted to let you know that.  Thanks.

Should the entire volume be moved over to ICC now?  Currently on deal 131478 (ICC), 10,000 is being sold at 2.84.  The sale on the TXU ticket has been zeroed out on the deal line, but needs to be reallocated in Vol Mgmt.  If I need to move the additional 25,000 to ICC, I will.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for your help. Joanie x36574 
Aimee, If you review that deal in CPR, you can see that this is a desk to desk deal on ECT.  This is actually our transport of Waha gas on PGE, delivered into HPL.

Mandey, The Cox contract expired effective 12/1, so we should not have any gas coming to us from them.  The confirmation with PG&E should be adjusted. The Tribo deal is good.  If PG&E allocates gas to them, we are ok.  (I don't think they have been allocated gas in the last 7 months.)  Carlos probably has a contat with Cox.  Either you or he can call them to see if they have sold any of their interests. D Mandy MacKinnon 01/10/2000 11:05 AM 
Darren,  we had a situation in December that we need your help to resolve. Deal #125836 We have been purchasing gas from Cox Exploration on PG&E Hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility.  This purchase agreement terminated 11/30/99.  I didn't path the gas on PGEH, however, I will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at Thompsonville.  I didn't catch this and the Deal on the HPL side appeared to be a valid flow issue for Kim Vaughn.  The plant continued to confirm this gas. We have tried working through the pipeline, but they state that they will not know anything until the 15th.  Can you contact the producer and ask them to reverify this with the pipeline?  I would like Kim to be able to zero confirm and send back to Pops so Volume Management will not allocate up to the producer level. Also I just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at the same meter with Tribo Production.  Should there have been an expected volume in this Deal?  Is it possible that Cox exploration sold their interest in this well to Tribo.  It may turn out that we should have flowed the gas after all. 
At Sweeney (Mtr 1517), for December, 6,000/day was confirmed to the Phillips sale.  Acutally, we should have nominated a purchase of 4,000 and a sale of 10,000.  The original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date. So, I have created deal 148851.  Please reallocate mtr 1517 with these changes; sale of 10,000 on deal 93804, purchase of 4,000 on 148851.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Kim, Deal 93485 has meter 7268 attached to it.  You can apply the flow to this deal.  You may need to renom from MOPS to POPS to get it through the systems. D 
FYI. 
Lauri ..  i have put this on strangas gas until I can get a contract from daren. 
Kim/Anita- A volume of 7247mm shows to have been allocated to the Reliant 201 contract for November.  There was no nomination for Reliant at this point in November and, therefore, there should be no volume allocated to their contract. Please make sure these volumes are moved off the Reliant contract prior to November close. Thanks. 
Why do you keep changing your e-mail address? How were your first few days back at school?  You haven't burned down your home making class, have you?  Anyway, hope you have fun this weekend. Adios,

I have asked Robert Lloyd to look into this.  He handles our Industrial noms now. 
Robert, Please look into this . D. 
Richard, Please add Pat Clynes to your distribution list.  He now manages HPL Logistics. 
Stella, The deal is in Sitara (#11121).  However, that point has been inactivated. In OSS, you can manually enter the contract you need to allocate the volumes. D 
Heather, Please include Pat Clynes on all Logistics information.  He now manages the HPL group.  Thanks. Daren Heather Choate 01/06/2000 03:34 PM

This is a follow up to the earlier email I forwarded regarding CES historical information. Note the deadline of 1/15, I believe that should be Friday 1/14 so I need your responses by Thursday 1/13. Please fill out the spreadsheet for each area and forward back to me. I will consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective. Lets have them add everything they need and if challenged we can re-review later. Thanks - Bob 
FYI 
FYI - we will probably be asked what historical information is needed in our shop from a Logistics perspective. I would suggest asking the new CES employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer and asset transactions. Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to the IT folks. Thanks - Bob 
Pat, You should have been included on this.  I probably won't go to these meetings since I won't be dealing with Unify much in the future.  I don't mind going with you for the first couple of times if you need me to, though. D

Imelda, These people still need the Sitara access they currently have.  All are a part of the Texas Region.  Thanks. D Imelda Frayre 01/04/2000 05:53 PM 
Daren, I made sure the people you listed had the necessary access for the Texas region.  The only person that you listed that currently does not have access is Pat Clynes.  Pat will need to submit a security request in order to get access to Sitara.  In addition, I noticed that the people listed below had access to the Texas Logistics role in Sitara but were not included on your list.  Have they moved on to another group?  Please let me know, so that I can update their access accordingly.  Thank you for all your help. Call me if you have any questions (x35423). Imelda Frayre

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. 
Darren please get Pat a copy of this plan and review where it says Mary Smith with her . Thanks............ 
One more update to change references to Susie LLinas to DBA on call. 
Charlotte, This is a desk-to-desk deal.  You need to get with the scheduler on the East Desk who handles Transco.  Both desks will need to tie in MOPS.  In this case, POPS most  likely tried to update the HPL side, but the East Desk has not adjusted their side in MOPS. D 
Carlos, Please look into your Black Marlin info and see if you can find anything on this.  Thanks. D 
We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket. D Aimee Lannou   03/14/2001 11:03 AM 
Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA deal whole.  What do you suggest? AL 
Aimee, This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there is another way. Thu Aimee Lannou   03/14/2001 10:23 AM 
Why do you need it extended?  This deal may not be able to get extended.  Which meter are you having problems with? 
Aimee, I am so sorry...I don't know what's wrong with me.  The deal is 343421.  If you can't extend this deal please let me know.  Thanks Thu Aimee Lannou   03/14/2001 07:59 AM

Susan, Please see the attached file for January's production estimate.  This is pretty much the final estimate except that I have calls in to Costilla & Walter (Superior).  They both said that they would fax their nom once it was complete.  Hopefully this will be by Monday.  If not, all of the traders have reviewed the estimate and made their changes.  I feel pretty confident that this is a good number.  However, if your should receive any noms before Monday at noon, please update the file and send it to Carlos and Daren.

Daren - I just received an updated tufco spreadsheet from Brian Biggs.  There are still two days in question.  He shows 100.000 on the 23rd and 142.500 on the 30th.  MOPS shows 20.000and 32.542, respectively.  Please let me know which number is correct. Thanks. - Aimee

Kim, I will be out of the office next week.  Please get with Jennifer Sabine and go over these issues with her. Daren 
Here are the issues for HL&P for 11/99: The shortage at San Jac meter 1554 (the 95%) cannot be made up at 7268 because not enough flow at the meters.  What can we do?  Buyback? Adonis has nom of 10000mmbtu on day 4, should this be kept whole?   If so, how?  Day 4 flowed of 153mmbtu at the aggregate meter. Please advice. Thanks 
Susan, I need you to do the research on this meter.  You will need to review the various scheduling systems to see how this was handled prior to 2/96.  You can also check with Volume Management to see if they have any info regarding the allocation of the point.  Let me know what you find out and I will work on getting a deal in place.

Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business. It's a little harder to get things done. Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going. Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days. D ""buylow"" <buylow@houston.rr.com> on 03/31/2001 02:24:42 AM 
Did you survive bid week? ? I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff left? ? Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one) ? 
You need to path the change at mtr 8055.  You should not path the buyback at mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume.  All other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed with zero volumes.) D
