The Commission is getting calls from legislators, DOE, etc. about the prices and is going to have to provide some response.  Better if it coincides with Enron's view and is not anti-market. We still haven't decided what we will provide.  You definitely will be included in that discussion once we get the numbers from accounting.  Thanks.

TJ-Please forward to all of Kevin's trading group.  Thanks. _____________ The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their primary business is as a utility, like Enron). In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers. 
Christi- This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or municipalities and qualifying facilities (""QFs"") must obtain power marketing authorization.  The answer is no. With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision 
Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the industrials).

The SPP members completed the first of several scheduled parallel test sessions of the new electronic scheduling system, RTO_SS.  This first session was held on Friday, April 27 from 9am CDT to 1pm CDT.  There were a total of 9 SPP Control Areas that participated during this session.  Those Control Areas included; WR, KCPL, CSWS, WPEK, GRDA, MPS, SPS, SPA, and CLEC.  Many thanks to all those companies that participated!  We are hoping for a higher turnout at the next session. If you do not plan to participate during these parallel test sessions, please contact Barbara Gibson so arrangements can be made for your schedule approvals. These parallel test sessions are excellent opportunities for training and practice on the new system with live data being imported into RTO_SS.  During the times that parallel testing is NOT in session, users can test additional functionality by creating their own sample tags and taking the various actions on those associated schedules, i.e. approving, denying, adjusting, canceling, etc.  The system is available to users 24 hours per day. There will be 3 more parallel test sessions this week and finally 3 sessions the following week. The sessions this week are scheduled for: Tuesday, May 1 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT Wednesday, May 2 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT Friday, May 4 - 12pm CDT - 4pm CDT Please refer to the attached document for more details regarding logins, test information, etc. We still do not have many sources and sinks set up for the different Generation Providers and Load Serving Entities that wish to have direct approval rights on the schedules.  If you are a GP or LSE and need to get this data set up, please call Barbara Gibson or Shari Brown at SPP. If you have any trouble with RTO_SS please contact someone listed below: Barbara Gibson, 501-664-0146 x245, bgibson@spp.org Shari Brown, 501-664-0146 x23, sbrown@spp.org Josh Kirby, 501-664-0146 x306, jkirby@spp.org Regards, Barbara Gibson Supervisor, Applications Development Southwest Power Pool 501-664-0146 x245 bgibson@spp.org

This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled, grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will follow this policy until further notice.

To alert you to another item that may arise:  Some industrials have air permits that restrict them to running for self-supply backup generation only.  In such case, the air permit may have to be amended by the industrial before it can sell to the grid.  Feel free to call upon Gov't Affairs if you have a question about this.

In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers. 
Christi- This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or municipalities and qualifying facilities (""QFs"") must obtain power marketing authorization.  The answer is no. With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision

The SPP members completed the first of several scheduled parallel test sessions of the new electronic scheduling system, RTO_SS.  This first session was held on Friday, April 27 from 9am CDT to 1pm CDT.  There were a total of 9 SPP Control Areas that participated during this session.  Those Control Areas included; WR, KCPL, CSWS, WPEK, GRDA, MPS, SPS, SPA, and CLEC.  Many thanks to all those companies that participated!  We are hoping for a higher turnout at the next session. If you do not plan to participate during these parallel test sessions, please contact Barbara Gibson so arrangements can be made for your schedule approvals. These parallel test sessions are excellent opportunities for training and practice on the new system with live data being imported into RTO_SS.  During the times that parallel testing is NOT in session, users can test additional functionality by creating their own sample tags and taking the various actions on those associated schedules, i.e. approving, denying, adjusting, canceling, etc.  The system is available to users 24 hours per day. There will be 3 more parallel test sessions this week and finally 3 sessions the following week. The sessions this week are scheduled for: Tuesday, May 1 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT Wednesday, May 2 - 9am CDT - 1pm CDT Friday, May 4 - 12pm CDT - 4pm CDT Please refer to the attached document for more details regarding logins, test information, etc. We still do not have many sources and sinks set up for the different Generation Providers and Load Serving Entities that wish to have direct approval rights on the schedules.  If you are a GP or LSE and need to get this data set up, please call Barbara Gibson or Shari Brown at SPP.

Folks  -- Attached is a summary of the Commission's Order on California by Joe Hartsoe, Vice President of Fed. Reg. Affairs for Enron 
On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the

Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.

This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled, grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will follow this policy until further notice. Jarrett Friddle Supervisor, Tariff Administration 
On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.

I reviewed the Cal ISO filings below (in Sue's note) to determine general consistency with FERC orders on interconnection procedures.  Potential issues are identified below and you all can decide if Enron should protest/intervene (the West Developers may want to review this too).   Since I am not familiar with the Cal ISO procedures, I cannot determine whether protest is necessary (for example, PJM, NY, and NEPOOL have certain interconnection policies that would not be acceptable outside the pool, but that work ok for the pool). The TOs have also filed Amend. 39 interconnection procedures, but I have not looked at those to see if they mirror these.  Maybe one of the paralegals could check that.  In addition, one of you should review the filing letter and procedures to make sure that the statements made by Cal ISO are correct. (Filing letter) The Cal ISO states that these procedures are filed in response to FERC's orders and that the Cal ISO and Market Participants are examining policies that will ensure that the ISO Controlled Grid is expanded to support competitive markets.  It also states that it would have liked to propose complementary changes to its long-term planning and expansion process, but other priorities have prevented it from doing so. Discusses the two previously methodologies regarding interconnection procedures -- ""No Grandfathering of Transmission Rights"" and ""Advance Congestion Cost Mitigation"" (which was apparently rejected last year. (Filing Letter at 10) -- Cal ISO does not propose a method of sharing upgrade costs, but states that the procedures do not preclude such a provision.  This is one we have used in other Inter. Agreements:  If required by law or if the Parties mutually agree to allow one or more third parties to use the Interconnection Facilities or any part thereof (whether by transfer of the Interconnection Facilities to an RTO or otherwise) and such use decreases the capacity of the Interconnection Facilities available to TO or the Facility or otherwise causes any detriment to TO or the Facility or benefits any party (including TO) other than Generator, or if TO is compensated for the costs of the Interconnection Facilities (in whole or in part) for any reason, Generator will be entitled to compensation from TO based upon the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO, all third party users, and Generator, for the greater of (i) whatever costs Generator incurred in connection with the Interconnection Facilities, plus interest at the Interest Rate from the date of Generator's payment of the costs in connection with the Interconnection Facilities and (ii) the value that TO receives for the Interconnection Facilities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Parties may use any other mutually agreed upon methodology to determine such compensation. 3.3 If one or more third parties are to use the Interconnection Facilities in accordance with Section ___, Generator's obligation to reimburse TO for the operation and maintenance costs incurred by TO in connection with the Interconnection Facilities shall be based on the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO, all third parties users, and Generator, or on some other mutually agreed upon methodology; provided, however, that, under no circumstances shall Generator's share of TO's operation and maintenance costs be greater than its pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities. (Procedures) The timelines for submitting applications and responding to system impact studies (SIS) and facilities study (FS) are fine, per previous FERC orders (in fact, Cal ISO asks for 60 days to complete the Facilities Study -- PGE just filed requesting 90 days). 5.7.3.1.1.(c)  I would add ""on a non-discriminatory basis"" after ""unless

MEMORANDUM TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM: Don Santa, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Joe Hartsoe, Power Marketing Working Group Chair Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy DATE: September 20, 2000 RE:  ? Cal ISO Amendment 30 ? Alliance RTO Filing Two issues arose on the weekly conference call today on which we need your assistance and feedback.  Please forward comments to Julie Simon at 202-789-7200 or jsimon@epsa.org by close of business on Monday, September 25th. 1. Cal ISO Amendment 30 On September 11, 2000 the Cal ISO filed Amendment No. 30 to its ISO Tariff at FERC.  In this filing, the Cal ISO is ""reluctantly"" asking FERC for authority to buy forward contracts to meet its real-time balancing obligations.  Costs of the forward contracts would be allocated to Scheduling Coordinators who deviate in real time from their schedules.  Interventions and protests are due on October 2nd. While EPSA has consistently opposed an ISO role as market participant, there are concerns here about the lack of alternatives available in California. While an ISO's role in the real-time balancing market should be small, as a practical matter, the Cal ISO has been forced to procure thousands of megawatts in the real time markets.  Thus, deciding how to approach this filing balances difficult competing goals.  Please let us know how you would like EPSA to proceed. 2. Alliance RTO On September 15th the Alliance RTO made a compliance filing at FERC seeking to address all of FERC's concerns about its earlier proposals and purporting to meet all the requirements of Order No. 2000.  The filing retains a transco structure, with a 5 percent ownership limitation for individual market participants and a 15 percent ownership limitation on each class of market participants.  It also eliminates pancaked rates in favor of zonal, or license plate, rates for deliveries within the Alliance and postage-rates for through or out deliveries.  While the geographic scope is unchanged, the scope will be larger than any operating RTO.  The filing includes a pro-forma inter-RTO coordination agreement to address seams issues such as security coordination, market monitoring, regional planning ATC and TTC calculations and pricing reciprocity. Until now, EPSA has not been a party to the Alliance proceeding.  With this latest filing it may be appropriate for EPSA to intervene, raising issues of support or opposition to the filing.  To determine how to proceed, however, we need input from those companies that have been more closely involved in the development of the Alliance.  Please let us know how EPSA should proceed with respect to this latest filing.

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Summary of emails detailed below: Dave Delainey and Kevin Presto have authorized Enron protests of utilities seeking to renew their market based rates for power sales.  Enron has already filed detailed protests against AEP, Entergy, and Southern Energy Marketing. We also plan to file a detailed protest of Hydro Quebec. Protests of the following utilities will be very short (shown below) stating that FERC should condition the continuation of market based rates upon the utility joining a valid fully functioning RTO.

Millions to Left and ... F Y I ______________________________________________________________________________ _____________ A Section Utilities Secretly Lobbied Congress; Electric Firms Gave Millions to Left and Right to Halt Deregulation John Mintz 05/11/2000 The Washington Post FINAL A01 Copyright 2000, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved Some of the nation's largest electric utilities have secretly funneled millions of dollars through two front groups--one headed by well-known conservative leaders to appeal to Republicans, the other affiliated with unions--to stop Congress from deregulating their industry. The campaign, which at times was run out of the offices of the utilities' CEOs, was so secret that some Washington lobbyists for these same companies were kept in the dark about many of its activities, according to documents stamped ""confidential"" by the effort's organizers. The documents offer an inside view of the industry's clandestine efforts to wage its political battle through newly minted entities with innocuous-sounding names. While the use of such groups has become a common device in lobbying campaigns, it is rare to obtain a detailed operator's manual for such an effort, complete with candid assessments of individual lawmakers' vulnerabilities and specific budgets for waging grass-roots campaigns in their districts. Although the two groups--the conservative Citizens for State Power and the liberal Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance--have advertised heavily against deregulation, until now only those involved in the effort knew the organizations were the creation of the same network of utilities. This network believed using seemingly independent surrogates made their case more believable and shielded them from political risk. A 1998 memo said the utilities ran the groups in an arm's-length way described as ""discreet, guarded and highly confidential. . . . Fear of congressional reprisals conditioned this

Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.

Attached is our protest filed last week. 
On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.

Summary of emails detailed below: Dave Delainey and Kevin Presto have authorized Enron protests of utilities seeking to renew their market based rates for power sales.  Enron has already filed detailed protests against AEP, Entergy, and Southern Energy Marketing. We also plan to file a detailed protest of Hydro Quebec. Protests of the following utilities will be very short (shown below) stating that FERC should condition the continuation of market based rates upon the utility joining a valid fully functioning RTO. ((Ameren, FP&L, LGE/KU, Cinergy, TXU, VEPCO, and Duke).  Protests will be due over the next few months. Please let me know if you want to receive copies of the protests or drafts. CN 
Kevin said this looks good w/ these changes: 
Attached are Dan's comments regarding market-based rates. - 0133731.01 
On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.

TJ-Please forward to all of Kevin's trading group.  Thanks. _____________ The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy

Sarah, I haven't heard back from Jade yet.  Beginning to think she is on vacation. In any case, looking at the questions below, I think #2-3 shold not be problematic for us to answer; seems like #4 is irrelevant; and #1 will be sensitive.  In any case, I will touch base with Jade (on a general basis) and contact you as soon as that happens.  If Michelle calls again, please tell her to feel free to call me in the interim.  I met her briefly about a year and a half ago and she may remember me.  Thanks. Lara Sarah Novosel@ENRON 12/14/99 10:57 AM 
Lara: Here are the questions posed to us by DOJ (the attorney I spoke with is Michelle Cano - Jade Eaton is the lead attorney) 1. Markets that Enron is trading in 2. More information about Enron's request to become a control area in ECAR 3. Transmission constraints 4. Enron's plans for sale of power from its new plant in Illinois Power's service territory. In addition to these Enron-specific questions, Michelle also discussed more general issues about the AEP/CSW merger such as whether AEP's ownership of coal-fired generation combined with CSW's ownership of gas-fired generation will give the merged company market power Christi told me that Enron is not planning on building a generator in Illinois Power's service territory in the near future, so we are confused by DOJ's reference to this plant. Christi is in the loop on this issue also, so please include us both on emails or phone calls. Thanks for your help Lara. Sarah 
This decision upholds the FERC order that EPMI (and other marketers) properly terminated their prospective transactions with PCA during the summer of 1999 when PCA defaulted (EPMI was not required to give 60 days notice before termination). 
(April 17, 2001) In the attached decision of the D.C. Cir., Power Company of America lost each of its various challenges to FERC's decision that the 60-day notice of termination regulation did not apply to the sales agreements with PCA that marketers unilaterally terminated in the summer of '99.

I had a question from the commercial people about whether a muni could build a new interconnection to another utility to avoid stranded costs of the incumbent utility.  While the particular question happened to be in Indiana (and I sent them to Janine), they were stating that this stranded cost avoidance is something that they may want to tout as a benefit of building new interconnections. I think that we would look initially to the state restructuring law  to see if this is specifically addressed.  However, I recall someone saying that there may be a constitutional question as to whether an incumbent utility can charge stranded costs to someone who leaves its system, but I don't think this has been addressed at the appellate or Supreme Court level.  I want to make sure that our commercial people know what is the status of the law in this area. I would appreciate any help on this.  Thanks.

Reg Folks -- Per our conversation on the RTO conference call this am, please make sure and run the proposed details/rules of any real time market you are working on by Kevin Presto and Tim Belden before Enron agrees or proposes anything.  Kevin wants to have the generation curve and demand curve available.   However, there are many ways to set up such a market and the traders need to be involved (maybe with another meeting later).  For example, there are different ways of the dispatcher responding to bids, such as set point dispatch or sending out a price signal (what PJM does)--(probably many other methods too.)  In addition, Kevin does not like the way that NY can take out of merit generators. Let's make sure and keep the communication between our reg groups and with

Agreements Do you want to get this or are you already an in-house compendium? 
FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of      information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation. Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.)) Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers includes similar procedures. What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can result in loss of queue spot. Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L 
On 12/17/00, Duke filed interconnection procedures at FERC.  It did not file a pro forma Interconnection Agreement.  The procedures are generally fine and include: Posting of a queue (should be on the OASIS now) Negotiation of milestones List of Studies performed within the last 2 years will be on OASIS and available (with the customer name redacted) A new request (new queue spot) will be required for: any increase in the rated capacity of generating facilities or any other significant changes including, (1) a site change that impacts the flow of power on Duke's system, (2) change in interconnection point of > 5 miles or 25% of the length of the line to which the generating facility is connected; or (3) delay of commercial ops date of more than 6 months.

Attached below is EPMI's request to FERC for clarification that SPP should not proceed with spending $45 million to implement a market design until FERC approves SPP as an RTO and establishes the independent board.  Our request uses FERC's ruling telling Gridflorida not to do this.  (We also filed a similar request in GridSouth last month.) 
As filed today. - SPPREHEA.WPD 
We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their primary business is as a utility, like Enron). In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers. 
Christi- This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or municipalities and qualifying facilities (""QFs"") must obtain power marketing authorization.  The answer is no. With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision

On 3/14/01, FERC upheld a provision in a utility pro forma interconnection agreement, which provides that the terms and conditions of the IA would be superseded by any pertinent interconnection provisions required by an RTO, if the utility joins an RTO.  (APS case) We have been monitoring RTO proposed interconnection procedures and IA provisions and commenting as necessary.  We need to be mindful of this order as we negotiate IAs for our sites to the extent that such a provision is 
On 3/14/01, FERC granted EPMI and Duke's request for rehearing of Arizona Public Service interconnection procedures: APS is required to specify a time in the interconnection process after which a generator is no longer subject to additional studies (we pointed out the VEPCO limitation that no further studies are required after the Interconnection Agreement is signed or filed unsigned at FERC). APS is required to include in its procedures the study criteria (for example, Form 715) that it uses for system impact studies. These changes are helpful as FERC continues to build on previous orders in 
For the East (outside of the Northeast):  I don't think we need to intervene in any of the dockets. --EPMI is participating in the Arizona Public Service interconnection proceeding and I have been notifying Mary, etal of the status.  Also, I have provided the APX filings in PJM, New England, etal. to the traders (orders approving the filings are listed in this attachment.)

Those are some of the orders that I would look to should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change. Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on ""commenced construction.""  What I mean by ""commenced"" includes the utility purchase of easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the costs.

Tuesday, March 20, 2001 Electric Power Daily ENTERGY, FPL GROUP SAY =01+ISSUES HAVE ARISEN=01, IN PENDING MERGER, WILL NEED MORE TALKS Entergy and FPL Group said Monday that they would hold talks soon to address a address =01&certain issues=018 that have arisen in connection wit= h their pending merger, which had been agreed to last July. In a joint statement, t= he companies identified =01&governance structure/value-related issues and=20 integra-tion of the two companies =01& as matters that would be discussed. The two sides refused to make any further comments on the merger, making unclear which side had raised questions about the original deal. The companies gave no dates for the new talks, and they did not say if the merg= er is still targeted to be completed by the end of the year. Under the terms of the July 29 deal, which was called a =01&merger of equal= s,=018 shareholders in the two existing companies would turn in stock and receive shares in the new merged company that would have a market capitalization of $16.4-billion and $10.7-billion in debt and preferred stock. Also under the= =20 deal, FPL Chairman James Broadhead would become chairman of the new group and Entergy head Wayne Leonard would be president and chief executive officer. FPL would name eight directors to the new groups=01, board and Entergy seven. The announcement that the two sides would hold new talks about the merger was made early Monday and during the day common stocks of Entergy and FPL both slumped but closed above their lows for the day and well-ahead of year-before levels. Entergy traded as low as $36.25 before closing down 60 cents (1.6%) at $36.90, up 85.1% from March 20, 2000. FPL got as low as $60.50 and closed down $2.44 (3.8%) at $61.81. It was Monday=01,s biggest loser among electric stocks but was up 43.5% from March 20, 2000. Under the July 31, 2000, agreement, FPL holders are to get one share of a new holding company for each of their shares, and Entergy holders are to get 0.585 shares. At Monday=01,s closing price 0.585 of an FPL share was worth $36.159, less than Entergy=01,s closing price, so the acquisition premium would be negative 2%. Lehman Brothers downgraded

I have looked through this for the East (outside of Northeast) and have alerted our folks to retail filings and the commercial people to several IAs and agreements that may be of interest.  I don't see anything else in which we need to intervene. P.S.  Dynegy (Coral, etc.) is filing a request for rehearing of the Southern source and sink approval.  EPMI intervened, but did not take a position due to our pending sale of Caledonia to Cinergy (which FERC approved on Friday). We plan to look into filing a complaint against Southern for selling parking type services.  I am working with Kevin and will keep you all informed if we proceed.

As I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection  (e.g., the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to ""Transmission Service"" not interconnection service)  Although I haven't done a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6, 7.3, and 11.  Also ""transmission service"" should be capitalized. Some Other suggestions: Preamble - Sentence three - delete: ""[t]hese Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System.""

In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as follows: Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.

A helpful FERC order as we work on asset management deals: New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc. v. Duke Power Company, EL00-101-001. Order on Rehearing. Order issued October 11, 2000 addressing a complaint by New Horizon Electric Cooperative, Inc (New Horizon) against Duke Power Co. (Duke) seeking FERC resolution of four disputed issues, including treatment of energy imbalances not prevented by dynamic scheduling. New Horizon's complaint claimed that energy imbalance service does not apply to it, since it will employ dynamic scheduling to effectively remove its load from Duke's control area. Further, New Horizon maintained that any deviation between the dynamic schedule and the actual metered delivery of energy constituted inadvertent interchange energy (which is the net difference between actual and scheduled interchange energy between two control areas) and proposed that any differences would be returned in-kind within two hours. On November 9, New Horizon filed a request for rehearing or clarification of the October 11 Order. Order issued February 26 granting New Horizon's request for rehearing or clarification of the October 11 Order. Order clarifies that, to the extent dynamic scheduling by New Horizon operates successfully; New Horizon should not be subject to charges under Duke's Schedule 4 Energy Imbalance Service. In such circumstances, any imbalances between energy deliveries on behalf of New Horizon and New Horizon's load should be accounted for by Duke as inadvertent interchanges only. In addition, Order directed parties to negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for the successful operation of dynamic scheduling. 
Currently, (for the East) Thane takes the summaries of Northeast orders/filings and sends them to the traders/originators/reg folks, etc.  I look at the rest of the East info and send it/take it to the appropriate trader/originator/developer/reg person (EPMI and EES).  I also alert someone in our group if I think that we need to intervene/protest/participate. What I will start doing to make sure the loop is complete is to email the report to Joe, Mary, Jim, Rick and Sarah with my comments on what I have done (for example, alerted traders/developers to issues, alerted state reg. people to retail filings, etc.) and whether I think EPMI or EES need to get involved in any of the cases.

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint. We expect to receive authorization within 60 days. Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the industrials to file their separate reports with FERC. Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial. We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi 37007.

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy

I just spoke with Steve Doss and explained how to get a power marketer certificate at FERC (and EWG filing if necessary depending on who West Linn's partner is for plant ownership) and the 60 day (generally) time required (Although I think that FERC would be inclined to wave the 60 days based on the supply shortage in the West).  I also explained that EPMI is making a filing this week at FERC that would allow EPMI to provide some FERC filing services on behalf of industrial customers in order to facilitate their sales to the grid (when approved, hopefully in about 60 days).  He said that West Linn has not built the 2 cogens yet (43 MWs each of which West Linn would use appr. 17 MWs/hour), but that it is interested in setting up its licenses before the start of retail access on 10/1/01 in Oregon.  (An item to think about--I don't know anything about the Oregon retail program or current rate structure with PGE, but generally the lack of retail open access will not prevent an industrial on site generator from selling to the grid, unless its host utility rate schedule precludes it from doing so). I am sending him a FERC order issued last year dealing with industrials selling to the grid (InPower order), plus will send him the EPMI filing when we make it later this week.

Hi Christi- I just met with another potential customer who is going to buy power from us intially but may want to sell us power in the future due to a Cogen plant they are building. I asked if they were going to get a Power Marketers Certificate in order to sell the power and got a blank look. I mentioned that I had a colleague that could give them more information on how to go about getting this. Could you please call Steve Doss on (503) 557-6587 to point him in the right direction to getting the PMC?  He is with West Linn Paper Company here in Oregon. Thank you, Shari 
Kim--Please make one more change: Please add ""built"" in front of ""primarily"" throughout the document.  For example, in III.  The reason for this change is that some of these generators may not be currently used for on site generation (ie, may be sitting there unused.)  I don't think that this is a change that would cause FERC a problem, since the filing will allow us to bring to the grid more generation, whether currently used or not. For now, please change the service person for EES to both me and James Keller VP & ASST GEN CNSL (713) 853-1595 EB 0844 jkeller@enron.com Send finals to me one more time for review, then we should be ready to go.

FPC, FPL and TECO filed a lengthy response to all the protests of its amended filing.  Recall that EPMI filed a protest asking GridFlorida to implement a real time energy market and remove the day ahead balanced schedule requirement.   Dan Staines and Mike Roan are doing a good job because rather than replying that the real time energy market is a bad idea, the GridFlorida utilities responded that they are not necessarily opposed as a theoretical matter, there were some practical considerations that led them not to include such a market in their proposal, including ""(1) concerns that unbalanced schedules will not work without either some form of forward market or a centralized unit commitment process; (2) concerns that GridFlorida be able to demonstrate the ability to administer a market with balanced schedules before considering unbalanced schedules; and (3) concerns about the impact of market power in the region on the larger real-time energy market that would result from unbalanced schedules.""  Grid Florida then stresses that the decision to require balanced schedules is not necessarily meant to be permanent and the ability to submit unbalanced schedules, if not raised sooner, would be an issue for further consideration in the report on market design due within 18 months after commencement and that GridFlorida has complete freedom to propose changes to its tariff, which it could do at anytime (through the Advisory Committee.) 
We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their primary business is as a utility, like Enron). In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers. 
Christi- This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or municipalities and qualifying facilities (""QFs"") must obtain power marketing authorization.  The answer is no. With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision 
Attached below is EPMI's request to FERC for clarification that SPP should not proceed with spending $45 million to implement a market design until FERC approves SPP as an RTO and establishes the independent board.  Our request uses FERC's ruling telling Gridflorida not to do this.  (We also filed a similar request in GridSouth last month.) 
As filed today. - SPPREHEA.WPD 
On 12/17/00, Duke filed interconnection procedures at FERC.  It did not file a pro forma Interconnection Agreement.  The procedures are generally fine and include: Posting of a queue (should be on the OASIS now) Negotiation of milestones List of Studies performed within the last 2 years will be on OASIS and available (with the customer name redacted) A new request (new queue spot) will be required for: any increase in the rated capacity of generating facilities or any other significant changes including, (1) a site change that impacts the flow of power on Duke's system, (2) change in interconnection point of > 5 miles or 25% of the length of the line to which the generating facility is connected; or (3) delay of commercial ops date of more than 6 months. 
FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of      information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation. Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.)) Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers includes similar procedures. What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can result in loss of queue spot. Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L

SOCO filed interconnection procedures at FERC.  VEPCO and CP&L have protested SOCO's filing stating that they perform interconnection studies differently than SOCO in this aspect: VEPCO and CP&L state that they perform studies by modeling the transmission system with the loads in the base case unchanged and the output of existing and higher queued planned generators that serve load ratched down to allow the grid to accept the full output of the new generator ""at the point of

Reg Folks -- Per our conversation on the RTO conference call this am, please make sure and run the proposed details/rules of any real time market you are working on by Kevin Presto and Tim Belden before Enron agrees or proposes anything.  Kevin wants to have the generation curve and demand curve available.   However, there are many ways to set up such a market and the traders need to be involved (maybe with another meeting later).  For example, there are different ways of the dispatcher responding to bids, such as set point dispatch or sending out a price signal (what PJM does)--(probably many other methods too.)  In addition, Kevin does not like the way that NY can take out of merit generators. Let's make sure and keep the communication between our reg groups and with

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint. We expect to receive authorization within 60 days. Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the industrials to file their separate reports with FERC. Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial. We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi 37007.

Currently, (for the East) Thane takes the summaries of Northeast orders/filings and sends them to the traders/originators/reg folks, etc.  I look at the rest of the East info and send it/take it to the appropriate trader/originator/developer/reg person (EPMI and EES).  I also alert someone in our group if I think that we need to intervene/protest/participate. What I will start doing to make sure the loop is complete is to email the report to Joe, Mary, Jim, Rick and Sarah with my comments on what I have done (for example, alerted traders/developers to issues, alerted state reg. people to retail filings, etc.) and whether I think EPMI or EES need to get involved in any of the cases. Thanks. C. 
A helpful FERC order as we work on asset management deals: New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc. v. Duke Power Company, EL00-101-001. Order on Rehearing. Order issued October 11, 2000 addressing a complaint by New Horizon Electric Cooperative, Inc (New Horizon) against Duke Power Co. (Duke) seeking FERC resolution of four disputed issues, including treatment of energy imbalances not prevented by dynamic scheduling. New Horizon's complaint claimed that energy imbalance service does not apply to it, since it will employ dynamic scheduling to effectively remove its load from Duke's control area. Further, New Horizon maintained that any deviation between the dynamic schedule and the actual metered delivery of energy constituted inadvertent interchange energy (which is the net difference between actual and scheduled interchange energy between two control areas) and proposed that any differences would be returned in-kind within two hours. On November 9, New Horizon filed a request for rehearing or clarification of the October 11 Order. Order issued February 26 granting New Horizon's request for rehearing or clarification of the October 11 Order. Order clarifies that, to the extent dynamic scheduling by New Horizon operates successfully; New Horizon should not be subject to charges under Duke's Schedule 4 Energy Imbalance Service. In such circumstances, any imbalances between energy deliveries on behalf of New Horizon and New Horizon's load should be accounted for by Duke as inadvertent interchanges only. In addition, Order directed parties to negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for the successful operation of dynamic scheduling. 
I have reviewed this for the non-Northeast and non-West info and forwarded (i) contract/deal/etc. info to commercial people and (ii) retail info to Janine.  I don't see anything that we need to participate in. 
Mary--Do they want to see filings in the East?  If so, do we send to you for coordination with PGE or send directly to Jay Dudley (or someone else at PGE)?  Thanks. Mary Hain 03/15/2001 06:47 PM 
In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as follows: Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard Sanders should be responsible for the coordination. 
Jay--Couple notes: FERC has stated in several orders what it considers ""material changes"".  You may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok with the interpretations.  Those are some of the orders that I would look to should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change. Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on ""commenced construction.""  What I mean by ""commenced"" includes the utility purchase of easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the costs.  [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC decision.]]  Thanks. 
I have looked through this for the East (outside of Northeast) and have alerted our folks to retail filings and the commercial people to several IAs and agreements that may be of interest.  I don't see anything else in which we need to intervene. P.S.  Dynegy (Coral, etc.) is filing a request for rehearing of the Southern source and sink approval.  EPMI intervened, but did not take a position due to our pending sale of Caledonia to Cinergy (which FERC approved on Friday). We plan to look into filing a complaint against Southern for selling parking type services.  I am working with Kevin and will keep you all informed if we proceed.

Tuesday, March 20, 2001 Electric Power Daily ENTERGY, FPL GROUP SAY =01+ISSUES HAVE ARISEN=01, IN PENDING MERGER, WILL NEED MORE TALKS Entergy and FPL Group said Monday that they would hold talks soon to address a address =01&certain issues=018 that have arisen in connection wit= h their pending merger, which had been agreed to last July. In a joint statement, t= he companies identified =01&governance structure/value-related issues and=20 integra-tion of the two companies =01& as matters that would be discussed. The two sides refused to make any further comments on the merger, making unclear which side had raised questions about the original deal. The companies gave no dates for the new talks, and they did not say if the merg= er is still targeted to be completed by the end of the year. Under the terms of the July 29 deal, which was called a =01&merger of equal= s,=018 shareholders in the two existing companies would turn in stock and receive shares in the new merged company that would have a market capitalization of $16.4-billion and $10.7-billion in debt and preferred stock. Also under the= =20 deal, FPL Chairman James Broadhead would become chairman of the new group and Entergy head Wayne Leonard would be president and chief executive officer. FPL would name eight directors to the new groups=01, board and Entergy seven. The announcement that the two sides would hold new talks about the merger was made early Monday and during the day common stocks of Entergy and FPL both slumped but closed above their lows for the day and well-ahead of year-before levels. Entergy traded as low as $36.25 before closing down 60 cents (1.6%) at $36.90, up 85.1% from March 20, 2000. FPL got as low as $60.50 and closed down $2.44 (3.8%) at $61.81. It was Monday=01,s biggest loser among electric stocks but was up 43.5% from March 20, 2000. Under the July 31, 2000, agreement, FPL holders are to get one share of a new holding company for each of their shares, and Entergy holders are to get 0.585 shares. At Monday=01,s closing price 0.585 of an FPL share was worth $36.159, less than Entergy=01,s closing price, so the acquisition premium would be negative 2%. Lehman Brothers downgraded 
For the East (outside of the Northeast):  I don't think we need to intervene in any of the dockets. --EPMI is participating in the Arizona Public Service interconnection proceeding and I have been notifying Mary, etal of the status.  Also, I have provided the APX filings in PJM, New England, etal. to the traders (orders approving the filings are listed in this attachment.)

See Joe Hartsoe's summaries of FERC recent RTO orders. 
On 3/14/01, FERC granted EPMI and Duke's request for rehearing of Arizona Public Service interconnection procedures: APS is required to specify a time in the interconnection process after which a generator is no longer subject to additional studies (we pointed out the VEPCO limitation that no further studies are required after the Interconnection Agreement is signed or filed unsigned at FERC). APS is required to include in its procedures the study criteria (for example, Form 715) that it uses for system impact studies. These changes are helpful as FERC continues to build on previous orders in 
On 3/14/01, FERC upheld a provision in a utility pro forma interconnection agreement, which provides that the terms and conditions of the IA would be superseded by any pertinent interconnection provisions required by an RTO, if the utility joins an RTO.  (APS case) We have been monitoring RTO proposed interconnection procedures and IA provisions and commenting as necessary.  We need to be mindful of this order as we negotiate IAs for our sites to the extent that such a provision is

FERC has noticed this EPSA/EPMI, etal. filing for comments due 4/27/01.  EPSA will send out a list of suggested comments and feels that it would be better for companies to each file their own comments.  We (working with Charles) will handle the comments for Enron.  I don't anticipate that an RCR will be needed.  Thanks. EPSA, Enron, etal 12/15/00 request for technical conference on seams issues - Function 8 Technical Conference.doc 
Attached below is EPMI's request to FERC for clarification that SPP should not proceed with spending $45 million to implement a market design until FERC approves SPP as an RTO and establishes the independent board.  Our request uses FERC's ruling telling Gridflorida not to do this.  (We also filed a similar request in GridSouth last month.) 
As filed today. - SPPREHEA.WPD 
We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their primary business is as a utility, like Enron). In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers. 
Christi- This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or municipalities and qualifying facilities (""QFs"") must obtain power marketing authorization.  The answer is no. With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision

New Horizon's complaint claimed that energy imbalance service does not apply to it, since it will employ dynamic scheduling to effectively remove its load from Duke's control area. Further, New Horizon maintained that any deviation between the dynamic schedule and the actual metered delivery of energy constituted inadvertent interchange energy (which is the net difference between actual and scheduled interchange energy between two control areas) and proposed that any differences would be returned in-kind within two hours. On November 9, New Horizon filed a request for rehearing or clarification of the October 11 Order. Order issued February 26 granting New Horizon's request for rehearing or clarification of the October 11 Order. Order clarifies that, to the extent dynamic scheduling by New Horizon operates successfully; New Horizon should not be subject to charges under Duke's Schedule 4 Energy Imbalance Service. In such circumstances, any imbalances between energy deliveries on behalf of New Horizon and New Horizon's load should be accounted for by Duke as inadvertent interchanges only. In addition, Order directed parties to negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for the successful operation of dynamic scheduling. 
Currently, (for the East) Thane takes the summaries of Northeast orders/filings and sends them to the traders/originators/reg folks, etc.  I look at the rest of the East info and send it/take it to the appropriate trader/originator/developer/reg person (EPMI and EES).  I also alert someone in our group if I think that we need to intervene/protest/participate. What I will start doing to make sure the loop is complete is to email the report to Joe, Mary, Jim, Rick and Sarah with my comments on what I have done (for example, alerted traders/developers to issues, alerted state reg. people to retail filings, etc.) and whether I think EPMI or EES need to get involved in any of the cases. Thanks. C. 
Section B2 contains the same argument that we made to FERC in GridFlorida (mentions California .p. 11)  Due Monday 3/12.  Comments welcome.

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint. We expect to receive authorization within 60 days. Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the industrials to file their separate reports with FERC. Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial. We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi 37007.

Lynette Barnes has put the RTO filings, protests, responses, etc. on CD Rom. 
The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy 
Reg. Folks -- It is imperative that the ENA structurers below are included on information that you send to the originators and traders about your regions. Thanks for your help. Edith Cross - Southeast Jim Meyn - Northeast Brad Morse - Midwest Russ Porter/Jason Wiesepape - ERCOT Plus, please include Berney Aucoin on all the updates/info.

I just spoke with Steve Doss and explained how to get a power marketer certificate at FERC (and EWG filing if necessary depending on who West Linn's partner is for plant ownership) and the 60 day (generally) time required (Although I think that FERC would be inclined to wave the 60 days based on the supply shortage in the West).  I also explained that EPMI is making a filing this week at FERC that would allow EPMI to provide some FERC filing services on behalf of industrial customers in order to facilitate their sales to the grid (when approved, hopefully in about 60 days).  He said that West Linn has not built the 2 cogens yet (43 MWs each of which West Linn would use appr. 17 MWs/hour), but that it is interested in setting up its licenses before the start of retail access on 10/1/01 in Oregon.  (An item to think about--I don't know anything about the Oregon retail program or current rate structure with PGE, but generally the lack of retail open access will not prevent an industrial on site generator from selling to the grid, unless its host utility rate schedule precludes it from doing so). I am sending him a FERC order issued last year dealing with industrials selling to the grid (InPower order), plus will send him the EPMI filing when we make it later this week. SHARI STACK 02/21/2001 12:23 PM 
Hi Christi- I just met with another potential customer who is going to buy power from us intially but may want to sell us power in the future due to a Cogen plant they are building. I asked if they were going to get a Power Marketers Certificate in order to sell the power and got a blank look. I mentioned that I had a colleague that could give them more information on how to go about getting this. Could you please call Steve Doss on (503) 557-6587 to point him in the right direction to getting the PMC?  He is with West Linn Paper Company here in Oregon. Thank you, Shari 
Kim--Please make one more change: Please add ""built"" in front of ""primarily"" throughout the document.  For example, in III.  The reason for this change is that some of these generators may not be currently used for on site generation (ie, may be sitting there unused.)  I don't think that this is a change that would cause FERC a problem, since the filing will allow us to bring to the grid more generation, whether currently used or not. For now, please change the service person for EES to both me and James Keller VP & ASST GEN CNSL (713) 853-1595 EB 0844 jkeller@enron.com Send finals to me one more time for review, then we should be ready to go.

A couple of proceedings that I listed as pending have been recently granted: (1) ENA's sale of Gleason Power, West Fork and Des Plaines to Allegheny Energy Supply and (2) the revised rate schedules filed by EPMI and others to remove the codes of conduct due to the pending sale of PGE.  These changes are reflected in footnotes 10 and 15 respectively.  I have attached revised versions of EPMI's and EES' filings, as well as redlined versions. - 0133268.02 - MBREPMI.WPD - 0137355.01 - MBREES.WPD 
FPC, FPL and TECO filed a lengthy response to all the protests of its amended filing.  Recall that EPMI filed a protest asking GridFlorida to implement a real time energy market and remove the day ahead balanced schedule requirement.   Dan Staines and Mike Roan are doing a good job because rather than replying that the real time energy market is a bad idea, the GridFlorida utilities responded that they are not necessarily opposed as a theoretical matter, there were some practical considerations that led them not to include such a market in their proposal, including ""(1) concerns that unbalanced schedules will not work without either some form of forward market or a centralized unit commitment process; (2) concerns that GridFlorida be able to demonstrate the ability to administer a market with balanced schedules before considering unbalanced schedules; and (3) concerns about the impact of market power in the region on the larger real-time energy market that would result from unbalanced schedules.""  Grid Florida then stresses that the decision to require balanced schedules is not necessarily meant to be permanent and the ability to submit unbalanced schedules, if not raised sooner, would be an issue for further consideration in the report on market design due within 18 months after commencement and that GridFlorida has complete freedom to propose changes to its tariff, which it could do at anytime (through the Advisory Committee.) 
Reg Folks -- Per our conversation on the RTO conference call this am, please make sure and run the proposed details/rules of any real time market you are working on by Kevin Presto and Tim Belden before Enron agrees or proposes anything.  Kevin wants to have the generation curve and demand curve available.   However, there are many ways to set up such a market and the traders need to be involved (maybe with another meeting later).  For example, there are different ways of the dispatcher responding to bids, such as set point dispatch or sending out a price signal (what PJM does)--(probably many other methods too.)  In addition, Kevin does not like the way that NY can take out of merit generators. Let's make sure and keep the communication between our reg groups and with

SOCO filed interconnection procedures at FERC.  VEPCO and CP&L have protested SOCO's filing stating that they perform interconnection studies differently than SOCO in this aspect: VEPCO and CP&L state that they perform studies by modeling the transmission system with the loads in the base case unchanged and the output of existing and higher queued planned generators that serve load ratched down to allow the grid to accept the full output of the new generator ""at the point of

Agreements Do you want to get this or are you already an in-house compendium? 
FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of      information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation. Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.)) Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers includes similar procedures. What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can result in loss of queue spot. Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L 
On 12/17/00, Duke filed interconnection procedures at FERC.  It did not file a pro forma Interconnection Agreement.  The procedures are generally fine and include: Posting of a queue (should be on the OASIS now) Negotiation of milestones List of Studies performed within the last 2 years will be on OASIS and available (with the customer name redacted) A new request (new queue spot) will be required for: any increase in the rated capacity of generating facilities or any other significant changes including, (1) a site change that impacts the flow of power on Duke's system, (2) change in interconnection point of > 5 miles or 25% of the length of the line to which the generating facility is connected; or (3) delay of commercial ops date of more than 6 months.

This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled, grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will follow this policy until further notice.

FYI.  This is exciting! 
On 7/31/00, FERC approved SPP's interconnection procedures.  Items of interest: Third party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and Customer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in any instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion. The current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if someone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing customer should pay for any new studies required by others.) While SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60 days, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is reasonably needed.) If transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs of upgrades that are needed ""but for"" the interconnection.  However, once transmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the network upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the expansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines. Typically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to the interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on OASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which benefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all customers. Let me know if you would like a copy of the order.

On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks. 
** High Priority ** Christi - Attached is the final filing in word.  I also sent you a hard copy on Friday. - aep.doc 
Tom May asked me to get a summary of what FERC reviewed and why FERC found that HQ had mitigated its market power initially.  HQ's 3 year update is due in Nov. HQ, acting through Select, has the ability to move the price $20 or more. In accordance with our strategy to protest MBRs for problem utilties, EPMI will most probably protest the HQ request for continuation of MBRs.  Please proceed with the RCR for Tabors and B&P to research this problem and begin work on a protest.

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.

Kevin wants to hold off filing this RTO pleading until after our meeting with Kevin on Thurs. at 4:00. 
Dan--  Please put the attachment into filing format in order to make a filing in each of the current RTOs this Thursday 11/16.  Then, our detailed protests will be made on Monday 11/20, as planned. Mark Palmer asked that you forward the Thursday filings to your press contacts with a statement that unless properly structured, the RTO filings 
Attached is the proposed protest that EPMI would file next Monday 11/20 against FPL in its request for continuation of market based rates for its wholesale merchant function and affiliates.  EPMI has already filed detailed protests (unlike the attached generic protest) against AEP, Entergy and Southern due to problems with each utility's OASIS system.  EPMI plans to file this generic protest in other large vertically integrated utility requests for continuation of market based rates.  The attachment now includes a reference to Staff's investigation that states participation in an RTO, without the proper safeguards, including the elimination of the native load exception, will not necessarily reduce the utilities' ability to discriminate against third parties.  Plus, there is a reference that Staff found a perception that the SE is the worst area for discriminatory practices. Please let me know if you have an issue with EPMI making this filing in FPL's proceeding. Also, note:  EPMI plans to file this generic protest this Thursday in the current RTO proposals -- SPP, Entergy transco, Florida RTO, Southern, Grid south.  Then on Monday 11/20, EPMI will be filing its specific protests of other aspects of each RTO filing.

One solution is to ha= ve=20 the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha= ve=20 against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide= =20 variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20 region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20 Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively""=20 receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20 behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. = =20 While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,= =20 there is evidence of discriminatory instances. Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has= =20 largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the= =20 economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs= =20 have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d= ue=20 to the inherent flexibility of the current rules. Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20 transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20 manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20 transmission system and use many TLRs. There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development= =20 of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and= =20 there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices. TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act= ed=20 as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the= =20 SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20 reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20 perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20 interconnection studies. In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20 plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida. Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th= is=20 summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than= =20 the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20 radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20 prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20 generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20 SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20 extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.) The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to= =20 discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S= E=20 (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence= =20 in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20 justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20 discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes= =20 that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20 transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns= =20 that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio= n=20 found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In= =20 addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff= =20 thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. = =20 Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20 jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20 information. The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac= k=20 of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20 addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20 capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20 interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied= =20 Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20 construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.= =20 Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20 self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory. ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20 standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20 direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati= on=20 are needed. The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais= es=20 the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv= e=20 operation of the market in the SE.

NOTE TO STEVE, RICK, JOE AND JIM -- ENRON CONTINUES TO HAVE ISSUES WITH INTERCONNECTION.  THE FERC STAFF INVESTIGATION ALSO SAID THAT INTERCONNECTION POLICY (OR LACK THEREOF) CAN BE USED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER.  DO NOT NAME VEPCO, BUT THIS IS A VERY RECENT EXAMPLE THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DISCUSS AT LUNCH.  The developers are working to fix this with VEPCO commercial people, so I have not been asked to call FERC yet. --------- I discussed this with developer, Reagan Rorschach today.  Enron was working with VEPCO to site an IPP (Enron owned) in VEPCO.  We did not come to terms on the PPA this summer.  Enron would like to keep its ability to site the plant with the associated queue position.  VEPCO basically has ""tied"" our queue position to a PPA with VEPCO and, therefore, kicked Enron out of the queue when we did not execute a PPA. VEPCO recently filed interconnection procedures with FERC that have not been approved yet (these procedures were not in place when we got in the queue--there were only very general ""ask to interconnect"" procedures then). The only place that any ""milestones"" are mentioned is in the Interconnection Agreement (which, of course, VEPCO and Enron never executed).  In addition, a generator can lose its queue stop for ""material changes"" to the project. Several parties protested this very loose terminology, but we do not know what FERC will say.  By way of comparison, Consumers recently filed procedures that state ""material changes"" mean increases in MWs > 15% or increasing the in service date by more than 6 months.  This issue will be significant because if we get our queue spot back (which I think we should), we may change the configuration (or a purchaser could change).  I think that reductions in MWs or more stable configurations should not be considered ""material changes.""  Reagan is going to speak with the commercial VEPCO people and I'll call their attorney if necessary. In any event, this again is an example of the kind of problems independent generators continue to face until FERC establishes some general procedures or an interconnection rulemaking. Tom Chapman 12/04/2000 09:31 PM 
Sarah and Christi-- I have been working with Jeffrey Keenan and Reagan Rorschack on a power plant in NC.  This plant is in the VEPCO service territory, and so they want to interconnect with VEPCO.  Originally, they were working on a PPA with VEPCO, but this PPA fell apart in October.  VEPCO now claims that because the deal fell apart, our plant should be removed from the queue. If we are removed from the queue, we will fall behind a 640 MW plant in the same area of northern NC.  This is of great concern to the developers because they are afraid that there will be no move available transmission in this area of the grid. They are looking at a number of possible avenues of recourse.  They have started to talk with me regarding handling this on a state level with the NC PSC.  But, I think that this is probably a federal issue. Do you think that this should be handled on a federal level or on the state level?  Please let me know ASAP.  Thank you. Tom Chapman IF you need more information, let me know. 
This Canadian environmental advocacy group filed at FERC a protest of HQ's continuation of market based rates (EPMI also filed a protest).  They note: 
Donna Fulton is getting FERC new iD numbers for EOL. 
Dave--Do any FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) personnel have current active EOL passwords?  Thanks. 
We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments? 
Please forward to those on 2nd e-mail you just sent. Thanks. 
Leslie,after seeing point # 3 in writing , I would be extremely reluctant to submit. This kind of conjecture about  market manipulation , coming from us. would only serve to fuel the fires of the naysayers- I would delete. Thanks. 
The article deals with the Cal ISO credit risk and the effect on power prices.  This is on the Enron web site. Maybe we work this into the talking points response? Reliant Energy: Selling Pwr To Cal ISO Could Be Risky Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dec. 11, 2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Friday) By Mark Golden LAS VEGAS (Dow Jones)--BC Hydro's concerns about the California Independent System Operator's credit have spread quickly this week to other suppliers, forcing the grid operator to pay premium prices when it can't find electric supplies, Reliant Energy's (REI) vice president for western U.S. trading, Reggie Howard, said Friday. Suppliers are concerned about the ISO's financial guarantees from the investor-owned utilities, for whom it buys: Edison International (EIX), PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Sempra Energy (SRE). PowerEx, the power marketing unit of provincial utility BC Hydro, demanded letters of credit from the utilities for ISO purchases this week. Edison complied, while PG&E refused. Sempra said that the state of California should make the guarantee as part of a declared state of emergency. Reliant is looking at the ISO credit issue, but so far has demanded no such letters of guarantee, Howard said. Other risks in selling to the ISO include the possibility that state politicians will tell the ISO not to pay its bills. ""when you have state Sen. Steve Peace telling San Diego residents not to pay their electric bills two months ago, you worry about what might be said to the ISO. There are political risks,"" Howard said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. Peace, a democrat from the San Diego area, is chairman of the California Senate Budget Committee. Suppliers also risk that prices on sales to the ISO could be reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission anytime 24 months after the transaction occurs, under the proposed FERC order on California. Prices could be lowered retroactively, and refunds from the suppliers could be ordered. Sales to other western utilities face no such review. Taken together, these risks have forced the ISO to pay a premium of at least 10% more than market prices, according to several traders attending the Day of the Trader industry conference in Las Vegas Thursday and Friday. ""It could be 5% or 20%. We have a number, but we won't disclose it because that's proprietary,"" Howard said. Reliant, which has 3,800 megawatts of generators in California, has no plans to build any more plants in the state. The company is building a plant in Nevada, just east of the California border. The optimal location for any new plant, Howard said, is near California, but not inside the state. Howard said that Reliant isn't looking for offers to sell its California plants, but if a good offer came up, they would consider it. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; 
FYI -- When Dan Larcamp was here last week, we discussed access to information.  He stated that he does not think that any utilities, including marketers, are providing enough real time data to FERC.  (We have given FERC EOL passwords.)  Lloyd told Dan that FERC should get access to the NERC information for a start and Dan said that FERC was reluctant to do that politically because FERC doesn't like signing non-disclosure agreements, but they may go ahead and sign to get the process started. We discussed the TLR issues this summer and FERC staff's finding on lack of transmission utility data noted in the Investigations.  Dan told me that FERC is currently at ""one of my favorite utilities"" [must be Entergy or SOCO] 
Steve--Joe, Rick and I expressed concerns about suing TVA under the NERC ""agreements"".   Richard Sanders wants to have a conference call next week with the outside counsel, Bob Madden. 
ATTORNEY WORK PRIVILEGE NERC is establishing penalties for violations of many of its rules, beginning in 2000.  I have talked with Kevin Presto and the other operators and transmission people and hourly desk repeatedly about this.  Generally, we feel that we can remain in compliance and many of the operational rules are valid for reliability.  However, then we run into the ""interpretation"" issues that have plagued us this summer.  I think one problem is separating the valid ""operational"" reliability rules from the rules (like ATC) that have a huge market impact and can be misinterpreted and manipulated.  Until FERC actually reviews and approves NERC rules, I share Rick and Joe's concerns. Richard Shapiro@EES 12/09/99 12:08 PM 
I have some concern over the impact to us if we were to take the  position you suggest.--  I'm not sure we would be comfortable with NERC rules constituting the equivalent of a contract given how ""wonderful"" so many of their rules are. Will be interested to hear from Joe and Christi. Thanks. 
FYI 
I promise this is the final file: 
After talking with Kevin P., he said to change the sinks on the firm you want to TVA.  Joe and I will prepare to address the tariff issue at FERC (pro forma requires ultimate source and sink) to hopefully get the pro forma tariff changed.  Several other providers have raised this issue and backed off from the requirement. Patrick Hanse 12/20/99 05:14 PM 
Per out requests on Ameren from CE to TVA, we are confirmed on 50 mw's / month June-Sept. (With TVA our SINK).  We also have another 150 mw's /month July-Aug.  w/ CE source, TVA sink, that are in  ""STUDY"" mode. Enron North America Corp. 
Enron's proposal (attached to the SERC letter) was not limited to non-firm, since we just said ""transmission"".  TVA has told us by letter and now has refused firm requests that list ENSE as the sink.  We may want to think about trying to get TVA, through SERC, to agree to let us sink at ENSE on firm, based on SERC's acceptance of this compromise (except, per NERC, with the right to park more than we had proposed here).  In any event, we should think about these issues before responding.  There is no deadline for a quick response to the SERC 12/13/99 letter. Twanda Sweet 12/16/99 11:35 AM 
This letter is being sent in behalf of Richard Sanders (3-5587) 
Attached is our protest filed last week. 
(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition market based rates on RTO participation. GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the ""voluntary"" nature of Order No. 2000. Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is premature due to Southern's ""significant progress"" in developing an RTO. Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating that the Investigation is based on ""perception,"" not fact, and contains conclusions that are ""ill-formed.""  Southern concludes that the ""Southeastern bulk power market worked quite well"" this summer because there were no price spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first. (2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO filing in abeyance: Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the conclusion of the this period. (3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order request that it can be an RTO States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.) (4)  GridSouth response to protests It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership structure of the LLC GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an OATT?)

I've highlighted the portion of the article that discusses Enron. ******************************************** Tennessee Valley Authority Plans New Natural-Gas Fired Plant Dave Flessner , Chattanooga Times/Free Press ( January 13, 2000 ) Jan. 13--The Tennessee Valley Authority is preparing to locate its first new power plant in a generation. But unlike the massive and controversial nuclear plants TVA proposed in the 1960s, the newest power generating facility will be much smaller and less controversial than any plant TVA has erected in the past half century. TVA is proposing to build a natural gas-fired plant on farmland in Haywood County, Tenn., about 40 miles north of Memphis. TVA has optioned to buy any of three different farms near Brownsville, Tenn., to locate a plant capable of generating between 1,000 megawatts and 1,700 megawatts of electricity. The preferred plant size would be a Westinghouse unit costing TVA over $200 million and capable of generating 1,400 megawatts of power -- slightly more than what each reactor at the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant produces at full power. But the new plant will generate power less than 30 percent of the year when TVA's power demand is at its peak. ""We need additional peaking power in the western portion of our service territory and these sites are well located near natural gas pipelines and one of TVA's 500-kilovolt transmission lines,"" said Roy V. Carter, project leader for the proposed new plant. Mr. Carter said the natural gas-powered plant won't have the pollution problems of either coal or nuclear plants. The new plant would be the first that TVA has ever built not on a river or lake. But the underground water supplies should be adequate since the plant will typically operate only a few hours a day, even during the summer and winter peak demand periods. Environmentalists who have fought TVA's nuclear and coal plants in the past are welcoming the switch to natural gas. ""We support TVA getting a larger share of generation from natural gas because it is a much cleaner source of fuel,"" said Dr. Steve Smith, executive director of the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group. ""We would hope that TVA will try to use these type of plants to replace some of the dirtier coal plants, which are major sources of air pollution in the Valley. These shouldn't just be used to generate more and more power for TVA to sell without any type of demand

On 3/30/98, Aquila filed a complaint at FERC against Entergy that Entergy reserved all of the firm import capacity (2000 MW) at four key interfaces, even though Entergy did not designate any off-system network resources to cover these reservations.  Aquila's transmission requests were denied or curtailed causing it to suffer financial losses.  Entergy responded that Aquila had a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" of Order No. 888 et seq. and that a transmission provider may deny tariff requests, if that transmission

Can you please forward this to Miriam Erickson.  It is a Petition for Rulemaking that was filed with FERC 3/98.  Although FERC has not made this filing into a rulemaking, FERC did cite many of the examples in App. D in the RTO NOPR.  I would point out that Order No. 2000 would still not resolve examples like  A.1 unless the ""native load exception"" is removed and all uses of the transmission system are under the same tariff.  I would be happy to 
FYI-- ""E"" in the weekly report is the $5 million FERC penalty against Kinder Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but the FPA has similar penalty provisions for ""knowing and willful"" violations. Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric companies from the new data, it will result in some penalties. 
Attached is the FERC Weekly Report for week ending March 24. Also attached are supporting documents you may be interested in: 
Cynthia -- Attached is a memo (no names basis) with examples of problems EPMI encountered last summer.  You should probably ask Joe to make sure that it is OK to reference things that FERC enforcement said to me.  If not, I'll take that out of the memo.  This list is based on the list that Steve and Rick handed out to FERC?/or Congress? last summer in Washington. 
Per Jim's request for the database.  (I don't know if you want to put the= =20 values that Kevin is giving into the database). =20 (1)  Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market=20 scheduling proposal.

Also if a tranmission provider cuts the=20 transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally= =20 scheduled.

(6) Dick's made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing= =20 their new scheduling procedure (ultimate source and sink) with FERC.  This= =20 was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March 1 without a FERC= =20 filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint=20 situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav= e=20 incurred in the meantime (See Comm. Massey's concurrence in Aquila v. Enter= gy=20 about the lack of incentive to file complaints).  Kevin Presto said that=20 winning the protest at FERC (due 4/12) would be worth $100 MM. (7)  On 2/2, TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from=20 minute by minute to hourly accountability (notably, TECO revised its propos= al=20 before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein.) We worked wi= th=20 EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECO=01,s proposal.

We were able to get EPSA= =20 to protest this issue in TECO's initial filing.  Enron is planning to site= =20 generation in Florida, but we don't have the value on this win yet. (8)  FERC issued a NOPR on January 28 proposing to revise the= =20 way it assesses annual charges to public utilities.  Enron, along with=20 several other participants (Dynegy, Koch, APX, Citizens, NP Energy, Sonat a= nd=20 Williams), filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August, 1998,=20 requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges,=20 arguing that FERC's current system of assessing annual charges on sales for= =20 resale of power discourages trading, impedes reliance on competitive market= s=20 for power, and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new= =20 power marketers entering the market.  We proposed that FERC either assess i= ts=20 costs on transmission only, or reallocate the amounts that it collects=20 through sales transactions versus transmission transactions.  Although FERC= =20 does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot, the petition= =20 served its purpose. In the NOPR, FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on=20 transmission issues (a point that we made in the Petition), it is appropria= te=20 to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat= e=20 commerce by public utilities.  Under the current assessment system, FERC=20 divides its costs between transmission and sales.  Now FERC is proposing to= =20 collect its costs solely through transmission.  FERC justifies this change= =20 because it spends most of its time on transmission issues, and because=20 transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges=20 assessed to users of the grid.  FERC proposes to asses its costs to 1)=20 unbundled wholesale transmission; 2) unbundled retail transmission; and 3)= =20 bundled wholesale power sales.  Bundled native load transactions will=20 apparently avoid assessments of any FERC-related costs; however, EPSA and= =20 Enron are protesting this issue at FERC.  (Jim Steffes has been working on = a=20 calculation of additional value.) (9)  Interconnection Policy =01) Utilizing EPSA efforts, including Sarah's= =20 meeting with FERC, we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth (= in=20 the forum we suggested, i.e., an existing proceeding) in the Tennessee Powe= r=20 order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form= a=20 tariff, including that a generator doesn't have to request transmission and= =20 interconnection at the same time.  We worked with EPSA to draft the ""Model""= =20 interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy=20 interconnection proposal. (10)  AEP/CSW order =01) approved the merger but accepted intervenors=01,= =20 testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent=20 calculation of ATC postings (which we proposed) and independent market=20 monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by 12/15/01. = =20 Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth $20 MM to Enron.= =20 (Note: we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP, which AEP chose.).  Kev= in=20 said that AEP's ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR, so this h= as=20 a positive effect not just on AEP, but on all of ECAR. (11) MAPP =01) FERC further order on refunds.  MAPP refused to refund moni= es=20 that it was unable to collect from a non-jurisdictional member transmission= =20 owner, NPPD.  EPMI filed a protest to MAPP=01,s refund report, arguing that= MAPP=20 was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order.  FERC agreed= =20 with Enron and rejected MAPP=01,s refund report.  FERC said MAPP must refun= d the=20 full amount to transmission customers, whether or not it was able to collec= t=20 that money from NPPD.  Results in another $50,000 of refunds for EPMI.

This is an excerpt from FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on RTOs (eventually became Rule 2000).  It references the 3/98 petition that Enron, etal filed at FERC (which includes examples).

Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 72 - In March 1998, a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders 113/ filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure. 114/  Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition, the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market.  For example, the Petition asserts: Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing, rather than accommodating, transactions.  Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical, accurate information across control areas.  This can take the form of out-of-date or incorrect postings of ATC or, in some instances, intentional withholding of actual ATC.

Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 73 - is physically available than is being released for sale. [115/] The Petition alleges the existence of ""ATC exclusions, inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable access to the grid."" 116/  The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/ EPSA, the trade association representing certain power suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences: EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers, by, for example, minimizing reported available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise manipulating market operations. 118/ EPSA further stated that, ""The manipulation of ATC -- whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS 115/ Petition at 7-8. 116/ Id. at 15. 117/ Id. at Appendix D. 118/ EPSA Comments, Docket No. RM98-5-000, at 2 (filed September 21, 1998).

The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/  The representative concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved ""as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation 
Wed. we will be filing our protest (plus, many others will be filing protests) that Entergy's filing is discriminatory and not the way to solve transmission constraints issues.  Actually, Entergy proposes solving constraint issues by not allowing parking at a generation only control area and by eliminating netting--both items that we won last year at NERC against TVA.  Entergy's filing is a proposal to solve ""partial paths"", which they call ""fictional"" sinks/sources via elimination of the path. Now MAIN and ComEd (specifically stating that it doesn't want us to sink at the Enron soon-to-be control area in ComEd) have raised this issue.  We are working on a response to ComEd and Dick may be going out to meet with them too. Finally, DUKE AND CINERGY both told me that while their marketing/traders greatly want to protest Entergy's filing, their transmission side won't let them.  So both are filing plain vanilla interventions.  We need to again be looking for any NERC email blasters that go out from marketers of utilities now and into the summer, similar to what SCEM (Southern's marketer) sent out last year complaining about TLRs.  If you see any of these, let me know so we can possibly send them to FERC staff because it is very difficult to get them to take a public position.  PECO Energy is filing a good protest to Entergy.

Christi - FYI for the letter you are preparing for both Entergy and ComEd. Below, Harry Terhune from MAIN org. is advertising Entergy's recent tariff filing to MAIN members as a way to deal with ""partial path"" reservations and valid ATC calculations. 
Rita has been in the Enron litigation unit for a number of years.  She is getting her law degree and wants to continue working at Enron.  If she could assist us anywhere, please contact her.  Thanks. 
A number of parties protested Entergy's Source and Sink filing at FERC based on arguments similar to ours (discriminatory treatment of PTP customers/Generation only control areas approved by NERC).  As you can see, TDUs and utilities joined in on this.: Dynegy Power Marketing Aquila Energy Marketing Peco Energy Co. Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had left SPP) Coral Power, ELCON and Enron VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22 effective date.) Louisiana Energy Users Group Tenaska Power Services El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as ""hubs"" in order to move more toward the gas model) Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for hearing!  (There so far are no filings in support of Entergy.) 
I talked with Dan briefly about this to verify my conclusion that FERC would not get involved at this point.  The Florida issue seems similar to California (or any other state that has idiosyncratic siting issues) in that FERC has encouraged California to speed the siting of generation, but has not ordered it.  What I am not sure about is whether the possible DOE or Congressional emergency electricity legislation that Jim sent out yesterday (on demand side management payments) could also include language that would allow the federal government to override the certain state generation siting issues, such as the Florida law.

This item appeared in The Times & Free Press on Saturday, April 22, 2000. Thought you might be interested in it. Gas Turbines Help Meet New Power Peaks for TVA By DAVE FLESSNER Business Editor The Tennessee Valley Authority hasn't started building any new coal or nuclear power plants in more than 25 years. But the federal utility is still adding to its power to meet the growing demand for electricity. In each of the next three years, TVA is adding eight gas-fired turbines to help meet ever-higher electricity peaks in the summer months. The new units won't run most of the time, unlike the base-load plants erected during the first half-century of TVA's history. But TVA is still spending more than $700 million for all of the new plants and contracting to spend more money buying power from other producers in the Tennessee Valley. ""Our summer peaks are growing from 2 to 3 percent a year and we need these units to meet our power demand,"" said TVA spokesman Gil Francis. ""These are the most reliable and best-cost option for us at this time.""  With an extra 600 megawatts of capacity from eight of the gas- or oil-fired turbines this summer, TVA officials insist they are ready for an expected record-breaking demand for electricity later this year. ""We don't control the weather,"" TVA Senior Vice President Greg Vincent told agency directors earlier this week. ""A real extreme weather event could cause us problems, and a lot of other people problems. But outside of that, we have taken every measure we can.""  TVA consumers demanded a record 28,295 megawatts last July 30 when temperatures across the valley averaged 96 degrees. TVA projects the demand will be up 2 to 3 percent this year because of the growing number of homes, businesses and air conditioners in its 7-state service territory. TVA is adding four gas turbines at both its Gallatin and Johnsonville fossil plants in Tennessee. The turbines will cost about $200 million and give TVA a total of 28.  The agency will build another eight units next summer, and its board on Wednesday approved a $246.8 million contract with General Electric for another 680 megawatts of peaking power from eight more units. Those units, equipped to burn either coal or oil, are scheduled to come on line in June 2002.  ""There's a long waiting period for these units, so you've got to get in line to get them ready when you need it,"" Mr. Francis said. But the scheduling and cost for the peaking units is far less than building a major power plant. The Watts Bar Nuclear Power Plant, which TVA began in 1972, wasn't completed until 1996. The Unit 1 reactor alone cost $6 billion to complete.  To pare its $27 billion debt, TVA's board adopted a 10-year plan three years ago to limit new borrowings and to turn to other suppliers or peaking units to meet future energy growth.  Next year, TVA also has contracted to begin buying up to 440 megawatts of power from the Red Hills Power Project, a privately owned, lignite-powered plant in Mississippi. TVA has a backup plan this summer to buy up to $100 million in electricity from outside its system if needed to ensure it has a cushion of about 16 percent, Mr. Vincent said.  Drought conditions that could have limited power generation from TVA's 29 hydro units eased some with early April rains. However, valley rainfall still stands about 11/2 inches below normal for the year. Gary L.

Update:  Based on Charles' great MRD presentation to Power Trading, the traders have some ideas about this.  I'll provide more info as soon as I get it from them. 
We need to determine whether Enron should work toward a bulletin board for MRD on Enron Online if OATI is already working on one.  If so, we would need to act quickly in order to compete with OATI for the summer (if we even want to do that since OATI had a very good tagging agent that Enron's tagging system really didn't compete with).  OATI already has the online auctioneer and is working on adding the MRD bids/offers. Also, if Enron Online wants Enron in the middle of every transaction as a sleeve (unlike a third party bid/offer platform), then we need to consider that since all MRD transactions are physical, this will add to the FERC costs that Enron will pay (at least until we get a final rule from FERC on costs). Additionally, the market may not take to MRD as well if Enron is the sleeve on all transactions. 
The OATI folks have been pretty cose to the NERC MRD activities. I have provided Nelson Mueller (OATI) with some thoughts on how to simplify the MRD set-up process.  (This involves the steps marketers must perform to figure out what generation and how much is needed for redispatch.) I knew that OATI has been responsive to facilitating the MRD procedures in the ETAG software and were interested in being a bulletin board for the bids and offers.  However, would OATI provide more than just a bulletin board?  I suspect they will not back up these products financially llike Enron OnLine could. Additionally, NSP's generator marketer has asked me if our traders would be interested in a ""contracted one-stop"" MRD service utilizing NSP's uncommitted reserve generation capability.  These units are on the ""good"" side of the Eau-Claire Arpin interface in MAPP/MAIN.  I will offer this in my presentation tomorrow to the traders. 
Charles--The OATI group was here today to teach EPMI about the OATI products that we are using.  OATI said that it is investigating whether to implement a generation bid/offer service platform on OATI.  Charles--Any thoughts? Note:  The fact that Enron has contracted with OATI for services is 
Below is the filing Enron made yesterday protesting Entergy Power Marketing's request to continue Market Based Rates.  Aquila and Dynegy also filed good protests.  I will separately email the charts that were attached to Enron's filing once I receive them later today. Also, Enron has filed (1) a protest of Entergy's request to require ""ultimate"" ""Valid"" source and sink (no sinks to generation only control areas) on all reservations and (2) comments on Entergy's proposed interconnection procedures and agreement (note: this was struck from FERC's agenda yesterday).  Let me know if you need copies of those two filings.

Attached are the Figures and Tables for the Entergy Filing.  The first document should be all of the figures, and the rest should be each table in chronological order.  Andrea - 3ZLB01_.XLS - 3ZLC01_.XLS - 3ZLD01_.XLS - 3ZLF01_.XLS - 3ZLG01_.XLS - 3ZLX01_.XLS 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected two key elements of Southern Company Services, Inc.'s proposed Regional Transmission Organzation (RTO) and encouraged the company to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO for the Southeast. The Commission did not act on other issues raised by Southern. Southern's proposal for a for-profit gridco (grid company) that would include only new wholesale transmission services and have the benefits of certain rate incentives going to others rather than the RTO operator are inconsistent with FERC's RTO policy, the Commission said. Under Southern's proposal, existing owners' transmission facilities related to bundled retail service or native load would not be under the gridco's control. As a result, the vast majority of total transmission load would not be under the RTO's tariff, operation or direction. The RTO rule requires all transmission facilities operate under the transco. In addition, Southern could not plan, design and operate a regional grid in a manner that maximizes efficiency if the transco controlled only a small part of the RTO load, the Commission said in rejecting Southern's proposal. As an alternative to filing a revised RTO proposal, the Commission asked that Southern consider joining neighboring utilities in an RTO in the Southeast. The Commission directed Southern to file a report by July 13, 2001, on progress in forming a Southeastern RTO. 
I reviewed the ECAR filing.  ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an ECAR control area.  I generally think it is a good filing and of importance because it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a region has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, reliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).  The compensation between ECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the grid.  It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to participate. Inadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.  The NERC performance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short parties.  Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the long party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation price for power) + 10% penalty.  A $15/MW offset is used as the price of power repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC settlement procedures.  Price information is confidential. The ECAR dispute resolution procedure is applicable (binding ADR is voluntary).  Parties retain the right to go directly to FERC. Lloyd -- Are you OK with the specifics? I do not see any reason to protest this.  EPSA wants to use the $15 offset to show what may be reasonable for generator interconnects and I am discussing it with EPSA.  We should file a routine intervention (to obtain pleadings, orders, etc.)  Interventions are due Friday, May 5. Anyone disagree? Dave Mangskau@ENRON 04/20/2000 04:58 PM 
Christi: for your info if you plan to file in support of this ECAR action, as Enron's rep to ECAR  I discussed this internally and have been supportive of a final product that includes sanctions.  Enron is not a voting member nor were we given an opportunity to make changes to the final document that went out for ballot..........but it was similar to what was discussed in recent ECAR meetings and was finalized after ECAR reps met with FERC staff to meet FERC concerns. In addition, several weeks ago I presented the ECAR concept to the MAPP Executive Committee and after discussion MAPP passed a resolution of support for what ECAR was trying to accomplish to improve reliability.   In order to make a payment sanction for inadvertent really work, it should be approved by an entire interconnection.  ECAR officials are expecting approval very quickly so that sanctions are in place this summer to help support reliability. If Enron has changed its position, and we plan to oppose this action, lets discuss the ramifications including putting at risk the expected Executive Board action on May 1 to ratify CRC and OP & L recommendations to grant conditional certification of our two control areas in ECAR.                    thanx 
ECAR actually filed this at FERC already this week.  I am getting a copy of the filing.  We will have an opportunity to respond to it at FERC. 
** PRIVATE ** ECAR has filed a Section 205 request for Commission approval of an ""Inadvertent Settlement Tariff.""  The Tariff is intended to obligate each Party to make payment and to entitle each Party to receive compensation for Inadvertent Interchange from each other Party pursuant to ECAR's Inadvertent Settlement Procedure.  Parties to the settlement include Allegheny Power (Monongahela Power Company, The Potomac Edison Company, and West Penn Power Company), American Electric Power Co., Big Rivers Electric Corp., Cinergy Corp., Consumers Energy Co., The Dayton Power and Light Co., The Detroit Edison Co., Duquesne Light Co., East Kentucky Power Cooperative, Inc., FirstEnergy Corp., Hoosier Energy REC, Indianapolis Power and Light Co., LG&E Energy Corp., Northern Indiana Public Service Co., Ohio Valley Electric Corp., and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co. I will let you know when this gets noticed. 
The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy 
TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source and sink filing. TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to the Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members ""predisposed to Enron's point of view.""  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy. Finally, TVA understands that ""Enron has prevented SERC"" from bringing the matter to NERC ADR. Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them on non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability until the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system (although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, I question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy also states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in case the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often does this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to check all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of timely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even analyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the tags now), Entergy says this is ""irrelevant"", but TLRs will be improved. Entergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that ""EPSA has not made a compelling argument that disclosure would harm liquidity.""  I think that the compelling arguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC approved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them and the tags don't require them. Entergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar information was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even so, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it inconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.) Finally, Entergy says that we can always put in ""anticipated"" source and sink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding that even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the power flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority. We are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the reliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material issue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least. 
Way to go ISO-NE!  Hats off to Dan Allegretti for nurturing this outcome! 
Jeff -- The region of MAIN sent a letter to NERC asking that the NERC Security Comm. make a new interpretation about reserving ATC and scheduling to a generation control area (since we will have the new Enron control area in MAIN within 2 weeks).  MAIN is trying to prohibit us from using our new control area as a source or sink.  Attached is Enron's response to NERC and Howard Hawks asking the PITF to tell MAIN that this issue has already been decided in last year's win over TVA.  A copy of MAIN's letter to NERC is 
Effective February 13, FERC approved the Southern Source and Sink restrictions, without comment other than stating that they mirrored Entergy's restrictions, approved last year.  Commissioner Massey concurred stating that this order is consistent with the Entergy precedent; however, he reiterated that this shows a flaw in OATT structure that gives LSEs a competitive advantage.  Massey calls on the RTO proposals to remedy this flaw. Other issues: Approved Interconnection procedures w/ these changes: -- While interconnection conveys no delivery service (must reserve transmission through OASIS), interconnection conveys an ongoing right to access the transmission system at the receipt point -- Requires Southern to provide credits for upgrades and explain its policy (interconnection customers only required to pay for ""but for"" interconnection costs) -- Southern will post required generator information on its OASIS and will allow customers 15 days to respond to requests for additional information without losing the queue position -- Cutoff for additional studies is execution of interconnection agreement (or date of filing unexecuted agreement) -- Identities of generators will not be posted on the queue Approved creditworthiness procedures with a credit quality of BBB+/Baa1 (LCs, guaranty, prepayment also allowed) Copy of order is attached. - ER01-668.00A.WPD 
APX's presentation about purchasing transmission rights over constrained flowgates.  Discussed at Dynegy last week and to be presented to FERC on May 24 by APX. 
On 5/17/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement (""IA"") and procedures subject to modification.  As I mentioned earlier, Entergy had adopted some of Enron's suggestion (in Enron's comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of generation. All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not included with an interconnection request. Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale, as well as unbundled retail. Dismisses EPSA's call for a ""model"" and approves Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement, subject to modification. Agreed with Enron that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence). Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to the IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions. Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate ""receipt"" of power without expansion, the new generator must pay costs of expansion. Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure ""interconnection"" and which are applicable when transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS). Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provide a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines). If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide. FERC will not initiate a ""generic"" proceeding at this time, but encourages all transmission providers to file procedures at FERC. Approves Entergy's credits for ""optional"" upgrades (required to transport power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work. Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subsequent studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator may be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  This is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS. Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating. Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, unless actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of studies). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency (or explain why that is inappropriate). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generator pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system. Entergy must submit a compliance tariff within 30 days.  Let me know if you 
This talks about the need for the proposed merchant generation to be built, so Dan W. is including this in the Entergy rehearing. 
Attached is EPMI's protest of GridFlorida's amended Dec. 15 filing.  We protested: Certain Governance provisions The allocation to the utilities of the PTRs (physical transmission rights) The balanced day ahead scheduling requirement (telling FERC that it should require a real time energy market instead) Suggest an alternative approach to the ICAP market in which the ICAP is monitored and a market only established after the icap drops (incentivizing the LSEs to keep their reserves at the required level) 
Attached is our brief protest of the merger asking FERC to condition approval on FPL and Entergy joining viable RTOs that include a real time energy market and transmission type/congestion hedging tools (we cite to our previously filed protests of Entergy and FPL's market based rates).  We also ask that a grid operator (MISO or PJM) be established over the entities to the extent that they are not in a viable fully functioning RTO by the merger approval date.   We also reserve our right to file additional data on problems with the merger, if necessary. 
FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of      information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation. Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.)) Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers includes similar procedures. What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can result in loss of queue spot. Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.

On 6/2/00, Enron participated in EPSA's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Industry Reliability Efforts for the summer (attached).  On 5/17/00, FERC issued streamlined market based rates filings for industrials with on-site generation to sell into the grid, decreased approval requirements for utility deals with customers to interrupt load, more FERC hotline staff, and better updates of ATC.

This is DYN's press release that refers to the FERC 's May 18 notice...? MANY THANKS KATHRYN 
I attended the kick off and coordinator committee meetings for UW today.  The ""Who wants to help Millions"" game begins next Wed. (7/19) via email.  I think Steve could encourage participation from his group with an email sent out Tues. 7/18 similar to this: 
Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions? Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items). Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes.  I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN! Other items: Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring and other activites during the year.  Other Enron business units will choose other UW agencies to sponsor through activities. We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign.  Do we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on August 9?  We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants. 
Richard--Joe has some ideas about this and will get back with you (and submit the RCR). ""Tabors, Richard"" <tabors@tca-us.com> on 07/18/2000 06:05:36 PM 
Christi, Jim, et al This last exchange has been very helpful.  The question that we need some guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with the results.  There are at least two levels that we could look at effectively. 1.  Fairly quickly, a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of '98 when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest.  It would need to focus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today (along with the midwest) and also get a glimmer on (rumor picked up here) the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers.  The conclusion from '98 was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for both generation additions and for DSM investments (load response). Presumably this would carry forward to a 2000 study. 2.  A more careful look at the same areas described above but more focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers.  WE covered this only in a cursory fashion in '98.  Here we would need to do two things.  The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folks understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions (the lesson of 
Thanks, Jim--Dan Larcamp seemed to genuinely want to learn what the problems are and to educate his staff.  In that regard, we have offered to have some of his staff down to use some of Enron's tools.  He was specifically asking for the data below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps.  I didn't get a feeling that he would use the data to say that everything is fine.  In fact, we took him through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a ""seminar"" type activity for some of his senior staffers.  He is in the process of bringing on some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues, etc.  He was very familiar with the other problems on the grid. He also asked Kevin why Enron doesn't want LMP everywhere because with our staffing we can run over everyone else.  Kevin told him that then there is no market liquidity and we can't trade with ourselves.  As it is now, there are less than 10 big players due to the transmission risk.  We explained in detail what happens in the ""Into"" Markets and why it is so difficult to deal with transmission/physical risk.  Kevin said that even the big bank players, like Morgan Stanley, usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation so they do not have to take transmission risk.  Dan L., having come from gas, understood the liquidity issues and had a good discussion with Kevin.  (He sat down in Kevin's chair and looked at pricing on EOL.) Overall, it was a very positive meeting.  Kevin was impressed that Dan L. really understood the issues and acted like he wanted to do something, but needed help in educating his people. James D Steffes@EES 07/18/2000 04:00 PM 
Christi, etal -- I don't disagree with this analysis, but the drive for competitive generation is not simply related to the short term benefits (one year total energy bill versus next year total energy bill).  Competitive generation is also about risk transfer - regulated monopolies assign all new plant risk to customers, merchant generation assigns all new plant risk to shareholders. In addition, I hope that Larcamp won't take our data / analysis and try to argue that ""everything is fine"".  Clearly there are many undone / misdone public policy problems (e.g., native load exception, hourly transmission, etc.) left in the wholesale energy markets. Jim 
Richard T. -- Dan Larcamp of FERC was here today and asked for a comprehensive, real price study using data from last summer or the last two summers showing how much on a $kw basis that retail customers were affected by the price spikes (including how much they saved as a result of hopefully lower prices for the remainder of the year.)  He needs this to fight price caps.  How much would something like that cost (probably using some of the data you gathered last year.)?  How long would it take to create?  Thanks for your help. 
AEP, ComEd, Duke and CP&L announced last week that they would be collaborating on a new version of a net based system better than OASIS.  I think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this.  There may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use: On 7/14, FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by 2/15/01 on OASIS Phase II (the new OASIS proposal).  In particular, FERC states that this new OASIS should address: (i) communication of critical market information (like transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs).  FERC says that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc. FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.) This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked out after the first denial for lack of ATC.)  FERC also wants information on whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that should be standardized. Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is available today.  (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted--FERC has not adopted that idea yet.) Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be very likely to be adopted (with some changes).  I think it is better to be in on the front end.  Enron's participation would also give validity to their system. Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more ""classes"" for his staff from Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky told Dan L. that ""AEP has nothing to hide.""  This type of venture would allow AEP one venue to make good on that statement. Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system. This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while maybe the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and adopt everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the ISO being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion occurs.  While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to all the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the information about congestion from the past several years, they could

On 7/31/00, FERC approved SPP's interconnection procedures.  Items of interest: Third party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and Customer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in any instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion. The current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if someone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing customer should pay for any new studies required by others.) While SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60 days, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is reasonably needed.) If transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs of upgrades that are needed ""but for"" the interconnection.  However, once transmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the network upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the expansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines. Typically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to the interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on OASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which benefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all customers. Let me know if you would like a copy of the order.

This talks about the need for the proposed merchant generation to be built, so Dan W. is including this in the Entergy rehearing. 
On 5/17/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement (""IA"") and procedures subject to modification.  As I mentioned earlier, Entergy had adopted some of Enron's suggestion (in Enron's comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of generation. All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not included with an interconnection request. Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale, as well as unbundled retail. Dismisses EPSA's call for a ""model"" and approves Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement, subject to modification. Agreed with Enron that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence). Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to the IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions. Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate ""receipt"" of power without expansion, the new generator must pay costs of expansion. Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure ""interconnection"" and which are applicable when transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS). Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provide a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines). If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide. FERC will not initiate a ""generic"" proceeding at this time, but encourages all transmission providers to file procedures at FERC. Approves Entergy's credits for ""optional"" upgrades (required to transport power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work. Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subsequent studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator may be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  This is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS. Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating. Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, unless actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of studies). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency (or explain why that is inappropriate). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generator pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system. Entergy must submit a compliance tariff within 30 days.  Let me know if you 
APX's presentation about purchasing transmission rights over constrained flowgates.  Discussed at Dynegy last week and to be presented to FERC on May 24 by APX. 
Jeff -- The region of MAIN sent a letter to NERC asking that the NERC Security Comm. make a new interpretation about reserving ATC and scheduling to a generation control area (since we will have the new Enron control area in MAIN within 2 weeks).  MAIN is trying to prohibit us from using our new control area as a source or sink.  Attached is Enron's response to NERC and Howard Hawks asking the PITF to tell MAIN that this issue has already been decided in last year's win over TVA.  A copy of MAIN's letter to NERC is 
Way to go ISO-NE!  Hats off to Dan Allegretti for nurturing this outcome! 
TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source and sink filing. TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to the Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members ""predisposed to Enron's point of view.""  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy. Finally, TVA understands that ""Enron has prevented SERC"" from bringing the matter to NERC ADR. Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them on non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability until the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system (although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, I question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy also states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in case the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often does this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to check all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of timely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even analyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the tags now), Entergy says this is ""irrelevant"", but TLRs will be improved. Entergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that ""EPSA has not made a compelling argument that disclosure would harm liquidity.""  I think that the compelling arguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC approved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them and the tags don't require them. Entergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar information was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even so, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it inconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.) Finally, Entergy says that we can always put in ""anticipated"" source and sink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding that even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the power flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority. We are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the reliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material issue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least. 
I reviewed the ECAR filing.  ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an ECAR control area.  I generally think it is a good filing and of importance because it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a region has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, reliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).  The compensation between ECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the grid.  It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to participate. Inadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.  The NERC performance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short parties.  Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the long party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation price for power) + 10% penalty.  A $15/MW offset is used as the price of power repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC settlement procedures.  Price information is confidential. The ECAR dispute resolution procedure is applicable (binding ADR is voluntary).  Parties retain the right to go directly to FERC. Lloyd -- Are you OK with the specifics? I do not see any reason to protest this.  EPSA wants to use the $15 offset to show what may be reasonable for generator interconnects and I am discussing it with EPSA.  We should file a routine intervention (to obtain pleadings, orders, etc.)  Interventions are due Friday, May 5. Anyone disagree? Dave Mangskau@ENRON 04/20/2000 04:58 PM 
Christi: for your info if you plan to file in support of this ECAR action, as Enron's rep to ECAR  I discussed this internally and have been supportive of a final product that includes sanctions.  Enron is not a voting member nor were we given an opportunity to make changes to the final document that went out for ballot..........but it was similar to what was discussed in recent ECAR meetings and was finalized after ECAR reps met with FERC staff to meet FERC concerns. In addition, several weeks ago I presented the ECAR concept to the MAPP Executive Committee and after discussion MAPP passed a resolution of support for what ECAR was trying to accomplish to improve reliability.   In order to make a payment sanction for inadvertent really work, it should be approved by an entire interconnection.  ECAR officials are expecting approval very quickly so that sanctions are in place this summer to help support reliability. If Enron has changed its position, and we plan to oppose this action, lets discuss the ramifications including putting at risk the expected Executive Board action on May 1 to ratify CRC and OP & L recommendations to grant conditional certification of our two control areas in ECAR.                    thanx 
ECAR actually filed this at FERC already this week.  I am getting a copy of the filing.  We will have an opportunity to respond to it at FERC. 
** PRIVATE ** ECAR has filed a Section 205 request for Commission approval of an ""Inadvertent Settlement Tariff.""  The Tariff is intended to obligate each Party to make payment and to entitle each Party to receive compensation for Inadvertent Interchange from each other Party pursuant to ECAR's Inadvertent Settlement Procedure.

Below is the filing Enron made yesterday protesting Entergy Power Marketing's request to continue Market Based Rates.  Aquila and Dynegy also filed good protests.  I will separately email the charts that were attached to Enron's filing once I receive them later today. Also, Enron has filed (1) a protest of Entergy's request to require ""ultimate"" ""Valid"" source and sink (no sinks to generation only control areas) on all reservations and (2) comments on Entergy's proposed interconnection procedures and agreement (note: this was struck from FERC's agenda yesterday).  Let me know if you need copies of those two filings.

Update:  Based on Charles' great MRD presentation to Power Trading, the traders have some ideas about this.  I'll provide more info as soon as I get it from them. 
We need to determine whether Enron should work toward a bulletin board for MRD on Enron Online if OATI is already working on one.  If so, we would need to act quickly in order to compete with OATI for the summer (if we even want to do that since OATI had a very good tagging agent that Enron's tagging system really didn't compete with).  OATI already has the online auctioneer and is working on adding the MRD bids/offers. Also, if Enron Online wants Enron in the middle of every transaction as a sleeve (unlike a third party bid/offer platform), then we need to consider that since all MRD transactions are physical, this will add to the FERC costs that Enron will pay (at least until we get a final rule from FERC on costs). Additionally, the market may not take to MRD as well if Enron is the sleeve on all transactions. 
The OATI folks have been pretty cose to the NERC MRD activities. I have provided Nelson Mueller (OATI) with some thoughts on how to simplify the MRD set-up process.  (This involves the steps marketers must perform to figure out what generation and how much is needed for redispatch.) I knew that OATI has been responsive to facilitating the MRD procedures in the ETAG software and were interested in being a bulletin board for the bids and offers.  However, would OATI provide more than just a bulletin board?  I suspect they will not back up these products financially llike Enron OnLine could. Additionally, NSP's generator marketer has asked me if our traders would be interested in a ""contracted one-stop"" MRD service utilizing NSP's uncommitted reserve generation capability.  These units are on the ""good"" side of the Eau-Claire Arpin interface in MAPP/MAIN.  I will offer this in my presentation tomorrow to the traders. 
Charles--The OATI group was here today to teach EPMI about the OATI products that we are using.  OATI said that it is investigating whether to implement a generation bid/offer service platform on OATI.  Charles--Any thoughts? Note:  The fact that Enron has contracted with OATI for services is

Gas Turbines Help Meet New Power Peaks for TVA By DAVE FLESSNER Business Editor The Tennessee Valley Authority hasn't started building any new coal or nuclear power plants in more than 25 years. But the federal utility is still adding to its power to meet the growing demand for electricity. In each of the next three years, TVA is adding eight gas-fired turbines to help meet ever-higher electricity peaks in the summer months. The new units won't run most of the time, unlike the base-load plants erected during the first half-century of TVA's history. But TVA is still spending more than $700 million for all of the new plants and contracting to spend more money buying power from other producers in the Tennessee Valley. ""Our summer peaks are growing from 2 to 3 percent a year and we need these units to meet our power demand,"" said TVA spokesman Gil Francis. ""These are the most reliable and best-cost option for us at this time.""  With an extra 600 megawatts of capacity from eight of the gas- or oil-fired turbines this summer, TVA officials insist they are ready for an expected record-breaking demand for electricity later this year. ""We don't control the weather,"" TVA Senior Vice President Greg Vincent told agency directors earlier this week. ""A real extreme weather event could cause us problems, and a lot of other people problems. But outside of that, we have taken every measure we can.""  TVA consumers demanded a record 28,295 megawatts last July 30 when temperatures across the valley averaged 96 degrees. TVA projects the demand will be up 2 to 3 percent this year because of the growing number of homes, businesses and air conditioners in its 7-state service territory. TVA is adding four gas turbines at both its Gallatin and Johnsonville fossil plants in Tennessee. The turbines will cost about $200 million and give TVA a total of 28.  The agency will build another eight units next summer, and its board on Wednesday approved a $246.8 million contract with General Electric for another 680 megawatts of peaking power from eight more units. Those units, equipped to burn either coal or oil, are scheduled to come on line in June 2002.  ""There's a long waiting period for these units, so you've got to get in line to get them ready when you need it,"" Mr. Francis said. But the scheduling and cost for the peaking units is far less than building a major power plant. The Watts Bar Nuclear Power Plant, which TVA began in 1972, wasn't completed until 1996. The Unit 1 reactor alone cost $6 billion to complete.  To pare its $27 billion debt, TVA's board adopted a 10-year plan three years ago to limit new borrowings and to turn to other suppliers or peaking units to meet future energy growth.  Next year, TVA also has contracted to begin buying up to 440 megawatts of power from the Red Hills Power Project, a privately owned, lignite-powered plant in Mississippi. TVA has a backup plan this summer to buy up to $100 million in electricity from outside its system if needed to ensure it has a cushion of about 16 percent, Mr. Vincent said.  Drought conditions that could have limited power generation from TVA's 29 hydro units eased some with early April rains. However, valley rainfall still stands about 11/2 inches below normal for the year. Gary L.

NOTE TO STEVE, RICK, JOE AND JIM -- ENRON CONTINUES TO HAVE ISSUES WITH INTERCONNECTION.  THE FERC STAFF INVESTIGATION ALSO SAID THAT INTERCONNECTION POLICY (OR LACK THEREOF) CAN BE USED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER.  DO NOT NAME VEPCO, BUT THIS IS A VERY RECENT EXAMPLE THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DISCUSS AT LUNCH.  The developers are working to fix this with VEPCO commercial people, so I have not been asked to call FERC yet. --------- I discussed this with developer, Reagan Rorschach today.  Enron was working with VEPCO to site an IPP (Enron owned) in VEPCO.  We did not come to terms on the PPA this summer.  Enron would like to keep its ability to site the plant with the associated queue position.  VEPCO basically has ""tied"" our queue position to a PPA with VEPCO and, therefore, kicked Enron out of the queue when we did not execute a PPA. VEPCO recently filed interconnection procedures with FERC that have not been approved yet (these procedures were not in place when we got in the queue--there were only very general ""ask to interconnect"" procedures then). The only place that any ""milestones"" are mentioned is in the Interconnection Agreement (which, of course, VEPCO and Enron never executed).  In addition, a generator can lose its queue stop for ""material changes"" to the project. Several parties protested this very loose terminology, but we do not know what FERC will say.  By way of comparison, Consumers recently filed procedures that state ""material changes"" mean increases in MWs > 15% or increasing the in service date by more than 6 months.  This issue will be significant because if we get our queue spot back (which I think we should), we may change the configuration (or a purchaser could change).  I think that reductions in MWs or more stable configurations should not be considered ""material changes.""  Reagan is going to speak with the commercial VEPCO people and I'll call their attorney if necessary. In any event, this again is an example of the kind of problems independent generators continue to face until FERC establishes some general procedures or an interconnection rulemaking.

Sarah and Christi-- I have been working with Jeffrey Keenan and Reagan Rorschack on a power plant in NC.  This plant is in the VEPCO service territory, and so they want to interconnect with VEPCO.  Originally, they were working on a PPA with VEPCO, but this PPA fell apart in October.  VEPCO now claims that because the deal fell apart, our plant should be removed from the queue. If we are removed from the queue, we will fall behind a 640 MW plant in the same area of northern NC.  This is of great concern to the developers because they are afraid that there will be no move available transmission in this area of the grid. They are looking at a number of possible avenues of recourse.  They have started to talk with me regarding handling this on a state level with the NC PSC.  But, I think that this is probably a federal issue. Do you think that this should be handled on a federal level or on the state level?  Please let me know ASAP.  Thank you. Tom Chapman IF you need more information, let me know. 
A number of parties protested Entergy's Source and Sink filing at FERC based on arguments similar to ours (discriminatory treatment of PTP customers/Generation only control areas approved by NERC).  As you can see, TDUs and utilities joined in on this.: Dynegy Power Marketing Aquila Energy Marketing Peco Energy Co. Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had left SPP) Coral Power, ELCON and Enron VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22 effective date.) Louisiana Energy Users Group Tenaska Power Services El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as ""hubs"" in order to move more toward the gas model) Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for hearing!  (There so far are no filings in support of Entergy.) 
Rita has been in the Enron litigation unit for a number of years.  She is getting her law degree and wants to continue working at Enron.  If she could assist us anywhere, please contact her.  Thanks. 
***BELOW ARE SUMMARIES OF THE HELPFUL FERC STAFF INVESTIGATIONS LEAD BY SCO= TT=20 MILLER (WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP) -- BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES = AT=20 LUNCH THURS. 12/7. - MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power=20 Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a= =20 Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff=20 (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of=20 information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss= ed=20 many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller= =20 (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under = no=20 obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically= =20 looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly= ,=20 Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the= =20 Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme= nt=20 for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by=20 requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other=20 transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to= =20 favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of=20 interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Sta= ff=20 to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of=20 complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p= ro=20 forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simp= ly=20 relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and= =20 procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions=20 pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and import= s=20 and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as we= ll=20 as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such=20 standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that=20 control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that= =20 each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. =20 Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could= =20 standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi= cs=20 similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with = a=20 reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the=20 regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a=20 traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the= =20 commodity and services. =20 DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,=20 transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission=20 Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such= ,=20 they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic= e=20 to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff= =20 received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information=20 available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated=20 incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lac= k=20 of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan= ts=20 to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. = =20 TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an=20 ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from= =20 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. = =20 Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with=20 virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were= =20 highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and=20 another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even= =20 though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment= ,=20 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The= =20 total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are= =20 not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose=20 procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commissi= on=20 has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open=20 Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to= =20 enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission= =20 has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,=20 including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market=20 because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an= =20 inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  I= n=20 addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase= d=20 loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one=20 control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for=20 price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants belie= ve=20 that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction= =20 increased in the Midwest. =20 Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of informati= on=20 in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules fo= r=20 service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission=20 access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a= nd=20 protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and=20 discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,= =20 such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs= =20 were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market=20 inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully= =20 analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk advers= e,=20 eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted th= at=20 because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed= =20 incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the=20 IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching= =20 the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,=20 particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided= =20 to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp= er=20 implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, al= l=20 three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and= =20 native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO=20 exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security=20 coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region= =20 of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  Th= e=20 result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. = =20 Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC aud= it=20 this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is=20 weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of=20 liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially= =20 on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several are= as=20 of non-compliance. =20 Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,= =20 with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flo= w=20 input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information= =20 transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under= =20 RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a=20 consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption= =20 and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission coul= d=20 benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t= he=20 TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also= ,=20 Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits= =20 or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to ha= ve=20 the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha= ve=20 against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide= =20 variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20 region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20 Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively""=20 receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20 behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. = =20 While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,= =20 there is evidence of discriminatory instances. Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has= =20 largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the= =20 economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs= =20 have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d= ue=20 to the inherent flexibility of the current rules. Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20 transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20 manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20 transmission system and use many TLRs. There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development= =20 of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and= =20 there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices. TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act= ed=20 as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the= =20 SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20 reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20 perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20 interconnection studies. In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20 plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida. Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th= is=20 summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than= =20 the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20 radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20 prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20 generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20 SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20 extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.) The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to= =20 discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S= E=20 (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence= =20 in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20 justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20 discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes= =20 that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20 transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns= =20 that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio= n=20 found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In= =20 addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff= =20 thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. = =20 Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20 jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20 information. The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac= k=20 of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20 addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20 capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20 interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied= =20 Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20 construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.= =20 Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20 self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory. ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20 standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20 direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati= on=20 are needed. The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais= es=20 the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv= e=20 operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20 Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20 criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d= o=20 not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs= =20 must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  = In=20 addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.= =20 However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives. *** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated= =20 weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the= =20 formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i= e,=20 treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20 tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio= n=20 of transparent and standardized information. Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20 ""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20 bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la= w=20 and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of= =20 deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20 incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20 addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list= s=20 a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the= =20 tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park= =20 power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20 development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential= . A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin= g=20 confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan= ge=20 information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available t= o=20 FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an= =20 established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not= =20 displayed in error.

Wed. we will be filing our protest (plus, many others will be filing protests) that Entergy's filing is discriminatory and not the way to solve transmission constraints issues.  Actually, Entergy proposes solving constraint issues by not allowing parking at a generation only control area and by eliminating netting--both items that we won last year at NERC against TVA.  Entergy's filing is a proposal to solve ""partial paths"", which they call ""fictional"" sinks/sources via elimination of the path. Now MAIN and ComEd (specifically stating that it doesn't want us to sink at the Enron soon-to-be control area in ComEd) have raised this issue.  We are working on a response to ComEd and Dick may be going out to meet with them too. Finally, DUKE AND CINERGY both told me that while their marketing/traders greatly want to protest Entergy's filing, their transmission side won't let them.  So both are filing plain vanilla interventions.  We need to again be looking for any NERC email blasters that go out from marketers of utilities now and into the summer, similar to what SCEM (Southern's marketer) sent out last year complaining about TLRs.  If you see any of these, let me know so we can possibly send them to FERC staff because it is very difficult to get them to take a public position.  PECO Energy is filing a good protest to Entergy.

[115/] The Petition alleges the existence of ""ATC exclusions, inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable access to the grid."" 116/  The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/ EPSA, the trade association representing certain power suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences: EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers, by, for example, minimizing reported available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise manipulating market operations. 118/ EPSA further stated that, ""The manipulation of ATC -- whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS 115/ Petition at 7-8. 116/ Id. at 15. 117/ Id. at Appendix D. 118/ EPSA Comments, Docket No. RM98-5-000, at 2 (filed September 21, 1998). Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 74 - management -- is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers."" 119/ At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans, we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City, Mississippi, of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment: Yazoo City, as a participant, has experienced first hand an individual [transmission] owner's continued ability to use its ownership and control [of] transmission to disadvantage competitors, notwithstanding Order 888's mandate of non-discriminatory transmission access. The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/  The representative concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved ""as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation 
Per Jim's request for the database.  (I don't know if you want to put the= =20 values that Kevin is giving into the database). =20 (1)  Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market=20 scheduling proposal.  When implemented, scheduled for June 2000, this will= =20 provide one stop shopping for next hour business.  Ties OASIS and TAGGING= =20 together into one request.  Also if a tranmission provider cuts the=20 transmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally= =20 scheduled.

Thi= s=20 has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new=20 configuration of the NERC relibiability effort. (6) Dick's made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing= =20 their new scheduling procedure (ultimate source and sink) with FERC.  This= =20 was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March 1 without a FERC= =20 filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint=20 situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav= e=20 incurred in the meantime (See Comm. Massey's concurrence in Aquila v. Enter= gy=20 about the lack of incentive to file complaints).  Kevin Presto said that=20 winning the protest at FERC (due 4/12) would be worth $100 MM. (7)  On 2/2, TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from=20 minute by minute to hourly accountability (notably, TECO revised its propos= al=20 before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein.) We worked wi= th=20 EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECO=01,s proposal.  We didn=01,t like TECO= 's=20 proposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name= =20 (since Enron is working with TECO on a project).   We were able to get EPSA= =20 to protest this issue in TECO's initial filing.  Enron is planning to site= =20 generation in Florida, but we don't have the value on this win yet. (8)  FERC issued a NOPR on January 28 proposing to revise the= =20 way it assesses annual charges to public utilities.  Enron, along with=20 several other participants (Dynegy, Koch, APX, Citizens, NP Energy, Sonat a= nd=20 Williams), filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August, 1998,=20 requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges,=20 arguing that FERC's current system of assessing annual charges on sales for= =20 resale of power discourages trading, impedes reliance on competitive market= s=20 for power, and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new= =20 power marketers entering the market.  We proposed that FERC either assess i= ts=20 costs on transmission only, or reallocate the amounts that it collects=20 through sales transactions versus transmission transactions.  Although FERC= =20 does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot, the petition= =20 served its purpose. In the NOPR, FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on=20 transmission issues (a point that we made in the Petition), it is appropria= te=20 to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat= e=20 commerce by public utilities.  Under the current assessment system, FERC=20 divides its costs between transmission and sales.  Now FERC is proposing to= =20 collect its costs solely through transmission.  FERC justifies this change= =20 because it spends most of its time on transmission issues, and because=20 transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges=20 assessed to users of the grid.  FERC proposes to asses its costs to 1)=20 unbundled wholesale transmission; 2) unbundled retail transmission; and 3)= =20 bundled wholesale power sales.  Bundled native load transactions will=20 apparently avoid assessments of any FERC-related costs; however, EPSA and= =20 Enron are protesting this issue at FERC.  (Jim Steffes has been working on = a=20 calculation of additional value.) (9)  Interconnection Policy =01) Utilizing EPSA efforts, including Sarah's= =20 meeting with FERC, we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth (= in=20 the forum we suggested, i.e., an existing proceeding) in the Tennessee Powe= r=20 order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form= a=20 tariff, including that a generator doesn't have to request transmission and= =20 interconnection at the same time.  We worked with EPSA to draft the ""Model""= =20 interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy=20 interconnection proposal. (10)  AEP/CSW order =01) approved the merger but accepted intervenors=01,= =20 testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent=20 calculation of ATC postings (which we proposed) and independent market=20 monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by 12/15/01. = =20 Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth $20 MM to Enron.= =20 (Note: we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP, which AEP chose.).  Kev= in=20 said that AEP's ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR, so this h= as=20 a positive effect not just on AEP, but on all of ECAR. (11) MAPP =01) FERC further order on refunds.  MAPP refused to refund moni= es=20 that it was unable to collect from a non-jurisdictional member transmission= =20 owner, NPPD.  EPMI filed a protest to MAPP=01,s refund report, arguing that= MAPP=20 was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order.  FERC agreed= =20 with Enron and rejected MAPP=01,s refund report.  FERC said MAPP must refun= d the=20 full amount to transmission customers, whether or not it was able to collec= t=20 that money from NPPD.  Results in another $50,000 of refunds for EPMI. (12)  Sarah is working on the PGE sale. 
Cynthia -- Attached is a memo (no names basis) with examples of problems EPMI encountered last summer.  You should probably ask Joe to make sure that it is OK to reference things that FERC enforcement said to me.  If not, I'll take that out of the memo.  This list is based on the list that Steve and Rick handed out to FERC?/or Congress? last summer in Washington. 
FYI-- ""E"" in the weekly report is the $5 million FERC penalty against Kinder Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but the FPA has similar penalty provisions for ""knowing and willful"" violations. Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric companies from the new data, it will result in some penalties.

Can you please forward this to Miriam Erickson.  It is a Petition for Rulemaking that was filed with FERC 3/98.  Although FERC has not made this filing into a rulemaking, FERC did cite many of the examples in App. D in the RTO NOPR.  I would point out that Order No. 2000 would still not resolve examples like  A.1 unless the ""native load exception"" is removed and all uses of the transmission system are under the same tariff.

On 3/30/98, Aquila filed a complaint at FERC against Entergy that Entergy reserved all of the firm import capacity (2000 MW) at four key interfaces, even though Entergy did not designate any off-system network resources to cover these reservations.  Aquila's transmission requests were denied or curtailed causing it to suffer financial losses.  Entergy responded that Aquila had a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" of Order No. 888 et seq. and that a transmission provider may deny tariff requests, if that transmission

I've highlighted the portion of the article that discusses Enron. ******************************************** Tennessee Valley Authority Plans New Natural-Gas Fired Plant Dave Flessner , Chattanooga Times/Free Press ( January 13, 2000 ) Jan. 13--The Tennessee Valley Authority is preparing to locate its first new power plant in a generation. But unlike the massive and controversial nuclear plants TVA proposed in the 1960s, the newest power generating facility will be much smaller and less controversial than any plant TVA has erected in the past half century. TVA is proposing to build a natural gas-fired plant on farmland in Haywood County, Tenn., about 40 miles north of Memphis. TVA has optioned to buy any of three different farms near Brownsville, Tenn., to locate a plant capable of generating between 1,000 megawatts and 1,700 megawatts of electricity. The preferred plant size would be a Westinghouse unit costing TVA over $200 million and capable of generating 1,400 megawatts of power -- slightly more than what each reactor at the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant produces at full power. But the new plant will generate power less than 30 percent of the year when TVA's power demand is at its peak. ""We need additional peaking power in the western portion of our service territory and these sites are well located near natural gas pipelines and one of TVA's 500-kilovolt transmission lines,"" said Roy V. Carter, project leader for the proposed new plant. Mr. Carter said the natural gas-powered plant won't have the pollution problems of either coal or nuclear plants. The new plant would be the first that TVA has ever built not on a river or lake. But the underground water supplies should be adequate since the plant will typically operate only a few hours a day, even during the summer and winter peak demand periods. Environmentalists who have fought TVA's nuclear and coal plants in the past are welcoming the switch to natural gas. ""We support TVA getting a larger share of generation from natural gas because it is a much cleaner source of fuel,"" said Dr. Steve Smith, executive director of the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group. ""We would hope that TVA will try to use these type of plants to replace some of the dirtier coal plants, which are major sources of air pollution in the Valley. These shouldn't just be used to generate more and more power for TVA to sell without any type of demand

Enron's proposal (attached to the SERC letter) was not limited to non-firm, since we just said ""transmission"".  TVA has told us by letter and now has refused firm requests that list ENSE as the sink.  We may want to think about trying to get TVA, through SERC, to agree to let us sink at ENSE on firm, based on SERC's acceptance of this compromise (except, per NERC, with the right to park more than we had proposed here).  In any event, we should think about these issues before responding.  There is no deadline for a quick response to the SERC 12/13/99 letter. Twanda Sweet 12/16/99 11:35 AM 
This letter is being sent in behalf of Richard Sanders (3-5587) 
After talking with Kevin P., he said to change the sinks on the firm you want to TVA.  Joe and I will prepare to address the tariff issue at FERC (pro forma requires ultimate source and sink) to hopefully get the pro forma tariff changed.  Several other providers have raised this issue and backed off from the requirement. Patrick Hanse 12/20/99 05:14 PM 
Per out requests on Ameren from CE to TVA, we are confirmed on 50 mw's / month June-Sept. (With TVA our SINK).  We also have another 150 mw's /month July-Aug.  w/ CE source, TVA sink, that are in  ""STUDY"" mode. Enron North America Corp. 
Steve--Joe, Rick and I expressed concerns about suing TVA under the NERC ""agreements"".   Richard Sanders wants to have a conference call next week with the outside counsel, Bob Madden. 
ATTORNEY WORK PRIVILEGE NERC is establishing penalties for violations of many of its rules, beginning in 2000.  I have talked with Kevin Presto and the other operators and transmission people and hourly desk repeatedly about this.  Generally, we feel that we can remain in compliance and many of the operational rules are valid for reliability.  However, then we run into the ""interpretation"" issues that have plagued us this summer.  I think one problem is separating the valid ""operational"" reliability rules from the rules (like ATC) that have a huge market impact and can be misinterpreted and manipulated.  Until FERC actually reviews and approves NERC rules, I share Rick and Joe's concerns. Richard Shapiro@EES 12/09/99 12:08 PM 
I have some concern over the impact to us if we were to take the  position you suggest.--  I'm not sure we would be comfortable with NERC rules constituting the equivalent of a contract given how ""wonderful"" so many of their rules are. Will be interested to hear from Joe and Christi. Thanks.

Steve Whitley told Dick Ingersoll yesterday that TVA would implement the NERC letter by Monday.  TVA said it was increasing the scheduling deadlines for within day multiple hour schedules to 90 minutes ahead for everyone.  Next hour would continue to be 30 minutes (which TVA changed to this summer from 20 min.).  The new tagging deadlines are supposed to be posted on TVA's OASIS

Jim--Attached per Dick Ingersoll's request is a description of the discussion yesterday for your inclusion in the minutes.  Thank you. 
Mr. Hawks--As requested by Mr. Skilling, I am sending to you the examples that Enron included in its October 6 letter to you (with several words added to fully explain the 2000 MW example).  As explained in the discussion in the October 6 letter, Enron would like to ensure that NERC's response specifically addresses the types of transactions included in these examples in order to avoid implementation problems and suggests including examples in your decision.  Thank you.  Christi Nicolay 713-853-7007 
Kevin, Steve, and Shashi--Per your request,  attached is a memo that addresses regulatory issues with Enron's potential minority investment in a software company providing tagging or scheduling software to the electric transmission industry.

We just sent this back to TVA and SERC.  Based on TVA's 8/4/99 letter to NERC (in response to Jeff's 8/31 letter), it appears that TVA has no intention of agreeing to allow Enron to sink at the control areas.  Elizabeth and I will have the letter to Howard Hawk ready for 5:00 for Jeff. 
Attached is a redlined version of Enron's response to TVA's proposal of this morning.

(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition market based rates on RTO participation. GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the ""voluntary"" nature of Order No. 2000. Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is premature due to Southern's ""significant progress"" in developing an RTO. Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating that the Investigation is based on ""perception,"" not fact, and contains conclusions that are ""ill-formed.""  Southern concludes that the ""Southeastern bulk power market worked quite well"" this summer because there were no price spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first. (2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO filing in abeyance: Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the conclusion of the this period. (3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order request that it can be an RTO States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.) (4)  GridSouth response to protests It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership structure of the LLC GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an OATT?)

Attached is the proposed protest that EPMI would file next Monday 11/20 against FPL in its request for continuation of market based rates for its wholesale merchant function and affiliates.  EPMI has already filed detailed protests (unlike the attached generic protest) against AEP, Entergy and Southern due to problems with each utility's OASIS system.  EPMI plans to file this generic protest in other large vertically integrated utility requests for continuation of market based rates.  The attachment now includes a reference to Staff's investigation that states participation in an RTO, without the proper safeguards, including the elimination of the native load exception, will not necessarily reduce the utilities' ability to discriminate against third parties.  Plus, there is a reference that Staff found a perception that the SE is the worst area for discriminatory practices. Please let me know if you have an issue with EPMI making this filing in FPL's proceeding. Also, note:  EPMI plans to file this generic protest this Thursday in the current RTO proposals -- SPP, Entergy transco, Florida RTO, Southern, Grid south.  Then on Monday 11/20, EPMI will be filing its specific protests of other aspects of each RTO filing. 
Tom and Cynthia--The SE reports includes some dings against TVA. On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.

I talked with Dan briefly about this to verify my conclusion that FERC would not get involved at this point.  The Florida issue seems similar to California (or any other state that has idiosyncratic siting issues) in that FERC has encouraged California to speed the siting of generation, but has not ordered it.  What I am not sure about is whether the possible DOE or Congressional emergency electricity legislation that Jim sent out yesterday (on demand side management payments) could also include language that would allow the federal government to override the certain state generation siting issues, such as the Florida law.

On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO. Some positive aspects for EPMI: States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has ""theoretical merit"", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented. Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected two key elements of Southern Company Services, Inc.'s proposed Regional Transmission Organzation (RTO) and encouraged the company to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO for the Southeast. The Commission did not act on other issues raised by Southern. Southern's proposal for a for-profit gridco (grid company) that would include only new wholesale transmission services and have the benefits of certain rate incentives going to others rather than the RTO operator are inconsistent with FERC's RTO policy, the Commission said. Under Southern's proposal, existing owners' transmission facilities related to bundled retail service or native load would not be under the gridco's control. As a result, the vast majority of total transmission load would not be under the RTO's tariff, operation or direction. The RTO rule requires all transmission facilities operate under the transco. In addition, Southern could not plan, design and operate a regional grid in a manner that maximizes efficiency if the transco controlled only a small part of the RTO load, the Commission said in rejecting Southern's proposal. As an alternative to filing a revised RTO proposal, the Commission asked that Southern consider joining neighboring utilities in an RTO in the Southeast. The Commission directed Southern to file a report by July 13, 2001, on progress in forming a Southeastern RTO. 
The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy 
Effective February 13, FERC approved the Southern Source and Sink restrictions, without comment other than stating that they mirrored Entergy's restrictions, approved last year.  Commissioner Massey concurred stating that this order is consistent with the Entergy precedent; however, he reiterated that this shows a flaw in OATT structure that gives LSEs a competitive advantage.  Massey calls on the RTO proposals to remedy this flaw. Other issues: Approved Interconnection procedures w/ these changes: -- While interconnection conveys no delivery service (must reserve transmission through OASIS), interconnection conveys an ongoing right to access the transmission system at the receipt point -- Requires Southern to provide credits for upgrades and explain its policy (interconnection customers only required to pay for ""but for"" interconnection costs) -- Southern will post required generator information on its OASIS and will allow customers 15 days to respond to requests for additional information without losing the queue position -- Cutoff for additional studies is execution of interconnection agreement (or date of filing unexecuted agreement) -- Identities of generators will not be posted on the queue Approved creditworthiness procedures with a credit quality of BBB+/Baa1 (LCs, guaranty, prepayment also allowed) Copy of order is attached. - ER01-668.00A.WPD 
Attached is EPMI's protest of GridFlorida's amended Dec. 15 filing.  We protested: Certain Governance provisions The allocation to the utilities of the PTRs (physical transmission rights) The balanced day ahead scheduling requirement (telling FERC that it should require a real time energy market instead) Suggest an alternative approach to the ICAP market in which the ICAP is monitored and a market only established after the icap drops (incentivizing the LSEs to keep their reserves at the required level) 
Attached is our brief protest of the merger asking FERC to condition approval on FPL and Entergy joining viable RTOs that include a real time energy market and transmission type/congestion hedging tools (we cite to our previously filed protests of Entergy and FPL's market based rates).  We also ask that a grid operator (MISO or PJM) be established over the entities to the extent that they are not in a viable fully functioning RTO by the merger approval date.   We also reserve our right to file additional data on problems with the merger, if necessary. 
FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of      information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation. Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.)) Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers includes similar procedures. What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can result in loss of queue spot. Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.

Attached are EPMI's responses to the FERC investigation of the bulk power markets in the East..  The ""summprob"" docs highlight examples of discriminatory practices and other problems with the OATT rules for trading and interconnection activities.  FERC staff asked for similar responses from 10 power marketers and plans to use the information in the aggregate in in its report to the Commission, due Nov. 1.

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while maybe the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and adopt everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the ISO being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion occurs.  While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to all the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the information about congestion from the past several years, they could

Tom May asked me to get a summary of what FERC reviewed and why FERC found that HQ had mitigated its market power initially.  HQ's 3 year update is due in Nov. HQ, acting through Select, has the ability to move the price $20 or more. In accordance with our strategy to protest MBRs for problem utilties, EPMI will most probably protest the HQ request for continuation of MBRs.  Please proceed with the RCR for Tabors and B&P to research this problem and begin work on a protest. 
On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.

FYI -- When Dan Larcamp was here last week, we discussed access to information.  He stated that he does not think that any utilities, including marketers, are providing enough real time data to FERC.  (We have given FERC EOL passwords.)  Lloyd told Dan that FERC should get access to the NERC information for a start and Dan said that FERC was reluctant to do that politically because FERC doesn't like signing non-disclosure agreements, but they may go ahead and sign to get the process started. We discussed the TLR issues this summer and FERC staff's finding on lack of transmission utility data noted in the Investigations.  Dan told me that FERC is currently at ""one of my favorite utilities"" [must be Entergy or SOCO] 
The article deals with the Cal ISO credit risk and the effect on power prices.  This is on the Enron web site. Maybe we work this into the talking points response? Reliant Energy: Selling Pwr To Cal ISO Could Be Risky Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dec. 11, 2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Friday) By Mark Golden LAS VEGAS (Dow Jones)--BC Hydro's concerns about the California Independent System Operator's credit have spread quickly this week to other suppliers, forcing the grid operator to pay premium prices when it can't find electric supplies, Reliant Energy's (REI) vice president for western U.S. trading, Reggie Howard, said Friday. Suppliers are concerned about the ISO's financial guarantees from the investor-owned utilities, for whom it buys: Edison International (EIX), PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Sempra Energy (SRE). PowerEx, the power marketing unit of provincial utility BC Hydro, demanded letters of credit from the utilities for ISO purchases this week. Edison complied, while PG&E refused. Sempra said that the state of California should make the guarantee as part of a declared state of emergency. Reliant is looking at the ISO credit issue, but so far has demanded no such letters of guarantee, Howard said. Other risks in selling to the ISO include the possibility that state politicians will tell the ISO not to pay its bills. ""when you have state Sen. Steve Peace telling San Diego residents not to pay their electric bills two months ago, you worry about what might be said to the ISO. There are political risks,"" Howard said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. Peace, a democrat from the San Diego area, is chairman of the California Senate Budget Committee. Suppliers also risk that prices on sales to the ISO could be reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission anytime 24 months after the transaction occurs, under the proposed FERC order on California. Prices could be lowered retroactively, and refunds from the suppliers could be ordered. Sales to other western utilities face no such review. Taken together, these risks have forced the ISO to pay a premium of at least 10% more than market prices, according to several traders attending the Day of the Trader industry conference in Las Vegas Thursday and Friday. ""It could be 5% or 20%. We have a number, but we won't disclose it because that's proprietary,"" Howard said. Reliant, which has 3,800 megawatts of generators in California, has no plans to build any more plants in the state. The company is building a plant in Nevada, just east of the California border. The optimal location for any new plant, Howard said, is near California, but not inside the state. Howard said that Reliant isn't looking for offers to sell its California plants, but if a good offer came up, they would consider it. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604;

On 6/2/00, Enron participated in EPSA's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Industry Reliability Efforts for the summer (attached).  On 5/17/00, FERC issued streamlined market based rates filings for industrials with on-site generation to sell into the grid, decreased approval requirements for utility deals with customers to interrupt load, more FERC hotline staff, and better updates of ATC.  In addition to FERC's proposals and requests for additional ideas, EPSA commented: Need robust competitive market to incentivize new generation Overall big requests--eliminate CBM, require independent ATC calculations, require independent Security Coordinators, and native load under same tariff Specific suggested fixes for this summer: (1) Require transmission providers to give written notice to FERC and post

We just sent this back to TVA and SERC.  Based on TVA's 8/4/99 letter to NERC (in response to Jeff's 8/31 letter), it appears that TVA has no intention of agreeing to allow Enron to sink at the control areas.  Elizabeth and I will have the letter to Howard Hawk ready for 5:00 for Jeff. 
Attached is a redlined version of Enron's response to TVA's proposal of this morning.  Enron will agree to disaggregate the control area numbers (we have revised the examples accordingly) and Enron will agree to remove the Gleason facility.

On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO. Some positive aspects for EPMI: States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has ""theoretical merit"", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented. Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval. 
Cynthia -- Attached is a memo (no names basis) with examples of problems EPMI encountered last summer.  You should probably ask Joe to make sure that it is OK to reference things that FERC enforcement said to me.  If not, I'll take that out of the memo.  This list is based on the list that Steve and Rick handed out to FERC?/or Congress? last summer in Washington.

TO:  Regional Chairmen Gentlemen: The attachment contains a letter from SERC to the NERC Chairman and the Chairman of the Policy Interpretation Task Force, with a copy to the NERC President, on the matter of the TVA/Enron dispute.  I wanted you to be aware of this communication.  I also want to be sure that you understand that our concerns deal solely with reliability and due process issues.  Please advise if you have questions concerning this matter.

This discusses Dynegy's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim Reliability measure for this summer.  Enron participated through EPSA (see my separate email) 
This is DYN's press release that refers to the FERC 's May 18 notice...? MANY THANKS KATHRYN 
Attached is SERC's 9/28 letter telling NERC that TVA and Enron were still working on the wording, but may not reach agreement. I don't think we had seen this before.  However, since this was sent last week before the latest round of language, I don't think we need to worry about it. 
Did you guys get this?  SRS

Attached is our brief protest of the merger asking FERC to condition approval on FPL and Entergy joining viable RTOs that include a real time energy market and transmission type/congestion hedging tools (we cite to our previously filed protests of Entergy and FPL's market based rates).  We also ask that a grid operator (MISO or PJM) be established over the entities to the extent that they are not in a viable fully functioning RTO by the merger approval date.   We also reserve our right to file additional data on problems with the merger, if necessary. 
***BELOW ARE SUMMARIES OF THE HELPFUL FERC STAFF INVESTIGATIONS LEAD BY SCO= TT=20 MILLER (WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP) -- BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES = AT=20 LUNCH THURS. 12/7. - MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power=20 Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a= =20 Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff=20 (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of=20 information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss= ed=20 many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller= =20 (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under = no=20 obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically= =20 looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly= ,=20 Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the= =20 Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme= nt=20 for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by=20 requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other=20 transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to= =20 favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of=20 interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Sta= ff=20 to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of=20 complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p= ro=20 forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simp= ly=20 relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and= =20 procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions=20 pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and import= s=20 and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as we= ll=20 as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such=20 standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that=20 control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that= =20 each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. =20 Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could= =20 standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi= cs=20 similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with = a=20 reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the=20 regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a=20 traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the= =20 commodity and services. =20 DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,=20 transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission=20 Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such= ,=20 they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic= e=20 to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff= =20 received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information=20 available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated=20 incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lac= k=20 of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan= ts=20 to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. = =20 TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an=20 ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from= =20 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. = =20 Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with=20 virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were= =20 highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and=20 another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even= =20 though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment= ,=20 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The= =20 total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are= =20 not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose=20 procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commissi= on=20 has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open=20 Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to= =20 enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission= =20 has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,=20 including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market=20 because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an= =20 inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  I= n=20 addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase= d=20 loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one=20 control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for=20 price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants belie= ve=20 that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction= =20 increased in the Midwest. =20 Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of informati= on=20 in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules fo= r=20 service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission=20 access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a= nd=20 protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and=20 discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,= =20 such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs= =20 were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market=20 inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully= =20 analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk advers= e,=20 eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted th= at=20 because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed= =20 incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the=20 IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching= =20 the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,=20 particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided= =20 to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp= er=20 implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, al= l=20 three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and= =20 native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO=20 exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security=20 coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region= =20 of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  Th= e=20 result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. = =20 Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC aud= it=20 this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is=20 weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of=20 liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially= =20 on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several are= as=20 of non-compliance. =20 Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,= =20 with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flo= w=20 input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information= =20 transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under= =20 RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a=20 consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption= =20 and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission coul= d=20 benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t= he=20 TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also= ,=20 Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits= =20 or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to ha= ve=20 the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha= ve=20 against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide= =20 variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20 region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20 Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively""=20 receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20 behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. = =20 While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,= =20 there is evidence of discriminatory instances. Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has= =20 largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the= =20 economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs= =20 have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d= ue=20 to the inherent flexibility of the current rules. Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20 transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20 manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20 transmission system and use many TLRs. There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development= =20 of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and= =20 there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices. TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act= ed=20 as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the= =20 SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20 reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20 perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20 interconnection studies. In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20 plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida. Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th= is=20 summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than= =20 the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20 radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20 prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20 generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20 SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20 extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.) The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to= =20 discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S= E=20 (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence= =20 in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20 justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20 discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes= =20 that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20 transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns= =20 that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio= n=20 found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In= =20 addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff= =20 thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. = =20 Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20 jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20 information. The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac= k=20 of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20 addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20 capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20 interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied= =20 Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20 construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.= =20 Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20 self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory. ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20 standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20 direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati= on=20 are needed. The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais= es=20 the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv= e=20 operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20 Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20 criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d= o=20 not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs= =20 must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  = In=20 addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.= =20 However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives. *** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated= =20 weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the= =20 formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i= e,=20 treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20 tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio= n=20 of transparent and standardized information. Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20 ""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20 bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la= w=20 and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of= =20 deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20 incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20 addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list= s=20 a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the= =20 tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park= =20 power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20 development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential= . A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin= g=20 confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan= ge=20 information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available t= o=20 FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an= =20 established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not= =20 displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC= =20 web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine=20 competition.

Kevin wants to hold off filing this RTO pleading until after our meeting with Kevin on Thurs. at 4:00. 
Dan--  Please put the attachment into filing format in order to make a filing in each of the current RTOs this Thursday 11/16.  Then, our detailed protests will be made on Monday 11/20, as planned. Mark Palmer asked that you forward the Thursday filings to your press contacts with a statement that unless properly structured, the RTO filings 
Attached is the proposed protest that EPMI would file next Monday 11/20 against FPL in its request for continuation of market based rates for its wholesale merchant function and affiliates.  EPMI has already filed detailed protests (unlike the attached generic protest) against AEP, Entergy and Southern due to problems with each utility's OASIS system.  EPMI plans to file this generic protest in other large vertically integrated utility requests for continuation of market based rates.  The attachment now includes a reference to Staff's investigation that states participation in an RTO, without the proper safeguards, including the elimination of the native load exception, will not necessarily reduce the utilities' ability to discriminate against third parties.  Plus, there is a reference that Staff found a perception that the SE is the worst area for discriminatory practices. Please let me know if you have an issue with EPMI making this filing in FPL's proceeding. Also, note:  EPMI plans to file this generic protest this Thursday in the current RTO proposals -- SPP, Entergy transco, Florida RTO, Southern, Grid south.  Then on Monday 11/20, EPMI will be filing its specific protests of other aspects of each RTO filing. 
Enron's proposal (attached to the SERC letter) was not limited to non-firm, since we just said ""transmission"".  TVA has told us by letter and now has refused firm requests that list ENSE as the sink.  We may want to think about trying to get TVA, through SERC, to agree to let us sink at ENSE on firm, based on SERC's acceptance of this compromise (except, per NERC, with the right to park more than we had proposed here).  In any event, we should think about these issues before responding.  There is no deadline for a quick response to the SERC 12/13/99 letter. Twanda Sweet 12/16/99 11:35 AM

Jeff -- The region of MAIN sent a letter to NERC asking that the NERC Security Comm. make a new interpretation about reserving ATC and scheduling to a generation control area (since we will have the new Enron control area in MAIN within 2 weeks).  MAIN is trying to prohibit us from using our new control area as a source or sink.  Attached is Enron's response to NERC and Howard Hawks asking the PITF to tell MAIN that this issue has already been decided in last year's win over TVA.  A copy of MAIN's letter to NERC is 
Mr. Hawks--As requested by Mr. Skilling, I am sending to you the examples that Enron included in its October 6 letter to you (with several words added to fully explain the 2000 MW example).  As explained in the discussion in the October 6 letter, Enron would like to ensure that NERC's response specifically addresses the types of transactions included in these examples in order to avoid implementation problems and suggests including examples in your decision.  Thank you.  Christi Nicolay 713-853-7007

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Tom and Cynthia--The SE reports includes some dings against TVA. On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.

Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.

FYI-- ""E"" in the weekly report is the $5 million FERC penalty against Kinder Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but the FPA has similar penalty provisions for ""knowing and willful"" violations. Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric companies from the new data, it will result in some penalties.

On 7/31/00, FERC approved SPP's interconnection procedures.  Items of interest: Third party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and Customer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in any instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion. The current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if someone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing customer should pay for any new studies required by others.) While SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60 days, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is reasonably needed.) If transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs of upgrades that are needed ""but for"" the interconnection.  However, once transmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the network upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the expansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines. Typically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to the interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on OASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which benefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all customers. Let me know if you would like a copy of the order.

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.

Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.

Tom and Cynthia--The SE reports includes some dings against TVA. On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.

Kevin wants to hold off filing this RTO pleading until after our meeting with Kevin on Thurs. at 4:00. 
Dan--  Please put the attachment into filing format in order to make a filing in each of the current RTOs this Thursday 11/16.  Then, our detailed protests will be made on Monday 11/20, as planned. Mark Palmer asked that you forward the Thursday filings to your press contacts with a statement that unless properly structured, the RTO filings 
Attached is the proposed protest that EPMI would file next Monday 11/20 against FPL in its request for continuation of market based rates for its wholesale merchant function and affiliates.  EPMI has already filed detailed protests (unlike the attached generic protest) against AEP, Entergy and Southern due to problems with each utility's OASIS system.  EPMI plans to file this generic protest in other large vertically integrated utility requests for continuation of market based rates.  The attachment now includes a reference to Staff's investigation that states participation in an RTO, without the proper safeguards, including the elimination of the native load exception, will not necessarily reduce the utilities' ability to discriminate against third parties.  Plus, there is a reference that Staff found a perception that the SE is the worst area for discriminatory practices. Please let me know if you have an issue with EPMI making this filing in FPL's proceeding. Also, note:  EPMI plans to file this generic protest this Thursday in the current RTO proposals -- SPP, Entergy transco, Florida RTO, Southern, Grid south.  Then on Monday 11/20, EPMI will be filing its specific protests of other aspects of each RTO filing.

One solution is to ha= ve=20 the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha= ve=20 against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide= =20 variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20 region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20 Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively""=20 receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20 behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. = =20 While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,= =20 there is evidence of discriminatory instances. Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has= =20 largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the= =20 economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs= =20 have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d= ue=20 to the inherent flexibility of the current rules. Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20 transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20 manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20 transmission system and use many TLRs. There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development= =20 of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and= =20 there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices. TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act= ed=20 as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the= =20 SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20 reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20 perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20 interconnection studies. In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20 plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida. Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th= is=20 summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than= =20 the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20 radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20 prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20 generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20 SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20 extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.) The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to= =20 discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S= E=20 (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence= =20 in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20 justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20 discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes= =20 that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20 transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns= =20 that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio= n=20 found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In= =20 addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff= =20 thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. = =20 Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20 jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20 information. The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac= k=20 of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20 addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20 capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20 interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied= =20 Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20 construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.= =20 Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20 self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory. ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20 standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20 direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati= on=20 are needed. The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais= es=20 the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv= e=20 operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20 Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20 criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d= o=20 not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs= =20 must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  = In=20 addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.= =20 However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives. *** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated= =20 weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the= =20 formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i= e,=20 treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20 tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio= n=20 of transparent and standardized information. Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20 ""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20 bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la= w=20 and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of= =20 deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20 incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20 addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list= s=20 a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the= =20 tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park= =20 power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20 development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential= . A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin= g=20 confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan= ge=20 information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available t= o=20 FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an= =20 established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not= =20 displayed in error.

NOTE TO STEVE, RICK, JOE AND JIM -- ENRON CONTINUES TO HAVE ISSUES WITH INTERCONNECTION.  THE FERC STAFF INVESTIGATION ALSO SAID THAT INTERCONNECTION POLICY (OR LACK THEREOF) CAN BE USED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER.  DO NOT NAME VEPCO, BUT THIS IS A VERY RECENT EXAMPLE THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DISCUSS AT LUNCH.  The developers are working to fix this with VEPCO commercial people, so I have not been asked to call FERC yet. --------- I discussed this with developer, Reagan Rorschach today.  Enron was working with VEPCO to site an IPP (Enron owned) in VEPCO.  We did not come to terms on the PPA this summer.  Enron would like to keep its ability to site the plant with the associated queue position.  VEPCO basically has ""tied"" our queue position to a PPA with VEPCO and, therefore, kicked Enron out of the queue when we did not execute a PPA. VEPCO recently filed interconnection procedures with FERC that have not been approved yet (these procedures were not in place when we got in the queue--there were only very general ""ask to interconnect"" procedures then). The only place that any ""milestones"" are mentioned is in the Interconnection Agreement (which, of course, VEPCO and Enron never executed).  In addition, a generator can lose its queue stop for ""material changes"" to the project. Several parties protested this very loose terminology, but we do not know what FERC will say.  By way of comparison, Consumers recently filed procedures that state ""material changes"" mean increases in MWs > 15% or increasing the in service date by more than 6 months.  This issue will be significant because if we get our queue spot back (which I think we should), we may change the configuration (or a purchaser could change).  I think that reductions in MWs or more stable configurations should not be considered ""material changes.""  Reagan is going to speak with the commercial VEPCO people and I'll call their attorney if necessary. In any event, this again is an example of the kind of problems independent generators continue to face until FERC establishes some general procedures or an interconnection rulemaking. Tom Chapman 12/04/2000 09:31 PM 
Sarah and Christi-- I have been working with Jeffrey Keenan and Reagan Rorschack on a power plant in NC.  This plant is in the VEPCO service territory, and so they want to interconnect with VEPCO.  Originally, they were working on a PPA with VEPCO, but this PPA fell apart in October.  VEPCO now claims that because the deal fell apart, our plant should be removed from the queue. If we are removed from the queue, we will fall behind a 640 MW plant in the same area of northern NC.  This is of great concern to the developers because they are afraid that there will be no move available transmission in this area of the grid. They are looking at a number of possible avenues of recourse.  They have started to talk with me regarding handling this on a state level with the NC PSC.  But, I think that this is probably a federal issue. Do you think that this should be handled on a federal level or on the state level?  Please let me know ASAP.  Thank you. Tom Chapman IF you need more information, let me know. 
This Canadian environmental advocacy group filed at FERC a protest of HQ's continuation of market based rates (EPMI also filed a protest).  They note: 
Donna Fulton is getting FERC new iD numbers for EOL. 
Dave--Do any FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) personnel have current active EOL passwords?  Thanks. 
We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments? 
Please forward to those on 2nd e-mail you just sent. Thanks. 
Leslie,after seeing point # 3 in writing , I would be extremely reluctant to submit. This kind of conjecture about  market manipulation , coming from us. would only serve to fuel the fires of the naysayers- I would delete. Thanks. 
The article deals with the Cal ISO credit risk and the effect on power prices.  This is on the Enron web site. Maybe we work this into the talking points response? Reliant Energy: Selling Pwr To Cal ISO Could Be Risky Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dec. 11, 2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Friday) By Mark Golden LAS VEGAS (Dow Jones)--BC Hydro's concerns about the California Independent System Operator's credit have spread quickly this week to other suppliers, forcing the grid operator to pay premium prices when it can't find electric supplies, Reliant Energy's (REI) vice president for western U.S. trading, Reggie Howard, said Friday. Suppliers are concerned about the ISO's financial guarantees from the investor-owned utilities, for whom it buys: Edison International (EIX), PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Sempra Energy (SRE). PowerEx, the power marketing unit of provincial utility BC Hydro, demanded letters of credit from the utilities for ISO purchases this week. Edison complied, while PG&E refused. Sempra said that the state of California should make the guarantee as part of a declared state of emergency. Reliant is looking at the ISO credit issue, but so far has demanded no such letters of guarantee, Howard said. Other risks in selling to the ISO include the possibility that state politicians will tell the ISO not to pay its bills. ""when you have state Sen. Steve Peace telling San Diego residents not to pay their electric bills two months ago, you worry about what might be said to the ISO. There are political risks,"" Howard said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. Peace, a democrat from the San Diego area, is chairman of the California Senate Budget Committee. Suppliers also risk that prices on sales to the ISO could be reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission anytime 24 months after the transaction occurs, under the proposed FERC order on California. Prices could be lowered retroactively, and refunds from the suppliers could be ordered. Sales to other western utilities face no such review. Taken together, these risks have forced the ISO to pay a premium of at least 10% more than market prices, according to several traders attending the Day of the Trader industry conference in Las Vegas Thursday and Friday. ""It could be 5% or 20%. We have a number, but we won't disclose it because that's proprietary,"" Howard said. Reliant, which has 3,800 megawatts of generators in California, has no plans to build any more plants in the state. The company is building a plant in Nevada, just east of the California border. The optimal location for any new plant, Howard said, is near California, but not inside the state. Howard said that Reliant isn't looking for offers to sell its California plants, but if a good offer came up, they would consider it. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; 
FYI -- When Dan Larcamp was here last week, we discussed access to information.  He stated that he does not think that any utilities, including marketers, are providing enough real time data to FERC.  (We have given FERC EOL passwords.)  Lloyd told Dan that FERC should get access to the NERC information for a start and Dan said that FERC was reluctant to do that politically because FERC doesn't like signing non-disclosure agreements, but they may go ahead and sign to get the process started. We discussed the TLR issues this summer and FERC staff's finding on lack of transmission utility data noted in the Investigations.  Dan told me that FERC is currently at ""one of my favorite utilities"" [must be Entergy or SOCO] 
Steve--Joe, Rick and I expressed concerns about suing TVA under the NERC ""agreements"".   Richard Sanders wants to have a conference call next week with the outside counsel, Bob Madden. 
ATTORNEY WORK PRIVILEGE NERC is establishing penalties for violations of many of its rules, beginning in 2000.  I have talked with Kevin Presto and the other operators and transmission people and hourly desk repeatedly about this.  Generally, we feel that we can remain in compliance and many of the operational rules are valid for reliability.  However, then we run into the ""interpretation"" issues that have plagued us this summer.  I think one problem is separating the valid ""operational"" reliability rules from the rules (like ATC) that have a huge market impact and can be misinterpreted and manipulated.  Until FERC actually reviews and approves NERC rules, I share Rick and Joe's concerns. Richard Shapiro@EES 12/09/99 12:08 PM 
I have some concern over the impact to us if we were to take the  position you suggest.--  I'm not sure we would be comfortable with NERC rules constituting the equivalent of a contract given how ""wonderful"" so many of their rules are. Will be interested to hear from Joe and Christi. Thanks. 
FYI 
I promise this is the final file: 
After talking with Kevin P., he said to change the sinks on the firm you want to TVA.  Joe and I will prepare to address the tariff issue at FERC (pro forma requires ultimate source and sink) to hopefully get the pro forma tariff changed.  Several other providers have raised this issue and backed off from the requirement. Patrick Hanse 12/20/99 05:14 PM 
Per out requests on Ameren from CE to TVA, we are confirmed on 50 mw's / month June-Sept. (With TVA our SINK).  We also have another 150 mw's /month July-Aug.  w/ CE source, TVA sink, that are in  ""STUDY"" mode. Enron North America Corp. 
Enron's proposal (attached to the SERC letter) was not limited to non-firm, since we just said ""transmission"".  TVA has told us by letter and now has refused firm requests that list ENSE as the sink.  We may want to think about trying to get TVA, through SERC, to agree to let us sink at ENSE on firm, based on SERC's acceptance of this compromise (except, per NERC, with the right to park more than we had proposed here).  In any event, we should think about these issues before responding.  There is no deadline for a quick response to the SERC 12/13/99 letter. Twanda Sweet 12/16/99 11:35 AM 
This letter is being sent in behalf of Richard Sanders (3-5587) 
Attached is our protest filed last week. 
(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition market based rates on RTO participation. GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the ""voluntary"" nature of Order No. 2000. Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is premature due to Southern's ""significant progress"" in developing an RTO. Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating that the Investigation is based on ""perception,"" not fact, and contains conclusions that are ""ill-formed.""  Southern concludes that the ""Southeastern bulk power market worked quite well"" this summer because there were no price spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first. (2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO filing in abeyance: Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the conclusion of the this period. (3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order request that it can be an RTO States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.) (4)  GridSouth response to protests It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership structure of the LLC GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an OATT?)

I've highlighted the portion of the article that discusses Enron. ******************************************** Tennessee Valley Authority Plans New Natural-Gas Fired Plant Dave Flessner , Chattanooga Times/Free Press ( January 13, 2000 ) Jan. 13--The Tennessee Valley Authority is preparing to locate its first new power plant in a generation. But unlike the massive and controversial nuclear plants TVA proposed in the 1960s, the newest power generating facility will be much smaller and less controversial than any plant TVA has erected in the past half century. TVA is proposing to build a natural gas-fired plant on farmland in Haywood County, Tenn., about 40 miles north of Memphis. TVA has optioned to buy any of three different farms near Brownsville, Tenn., to locate a plant capable of generating between 1,000 megawatts and 1,700 megawatts of electricity. The preferred plant size would be a Westinghouse unit costing TVA over $200 million and capable of generating 1,400 megawatts of power -- slightly more than what each reactor at the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant produces at full power. But the new plant will generate power less than 30 percent of the year when TVA's power demand is at its peak. ""We need additional peaking power in the western portion of our service territory and these sites are well located near natural gas pipelines and one of TVA's 500-kilovolt transmission lines,"" said Roy V. Carter, project leader for the proposed new plant. Mr. Carter said the natural gas-powered plant won't have the pollution problems of either coal or nuclear plants. The new plant would be the first that TVA has ever built not on a river or lake. But the underground water supplies should be adequate since the plant will typically operate only a few hours a day, even during the summer and winter peak demand periods. Environmentalists who have fought TVA's nuclear and coal plants in the past are welcoming the switch to natural gas. ""We support TVA getting a larger share of generation from natural gas because it is a much cleaner source of fuel,"" said Dr. Steve Smith, executive director of the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group. ""We would hope that TVA will try to use these type of plants to replace some of the dirtier coal plants, which are major sources of air pollution in the Valley. These shouldn't just be used to generate more and more power for TVA to sell without any type of demand

On 3/30/98, Aquila filed a complaint at FERC against Entergy that Entergy reserved all of the firm import capacity (2000 MW) at four key interfaces, even though Entergy did not designate any off-system network resources to cover these reservations.  Aquila's transmission requests were denied or curtailed causing it to suffer financial losses.  Entergy responded that Aquila had a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" of Order No. 888 et seq. and that a transmission provider may deny tariff requests, if that transmission

Can you please forward this to Miriam Erickson.  It is a Petition for Rulemaking that was filed with FERC 3/98.  Although FERC has not made this filing into a rulemaking, FERC did cite many of the examples in App. D in the RTO NOPR.  I would point out that Order No. 2000 would still not resolve examples like  A.1 unless the ""native load exception"" is removed and all uses of the transmission system are under the same tariff.  I would be happy to 
FYI-- ""E"" in the weekly report is the $5 million FERC penalty against Kinder Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but the FPA has similar penalty provisions for ""knowing and willful"" violations. Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric companies from the new data, it will result in some penalties. 
Attached is the FERC Weekly Report for week ending March 24. Also attached are supporting documents you may be interested in: 
Cynthia -- Attached is a memo (no names basis) with examples of problems EPMI encountered last summer.  You should probably ask Joe to make sure that it is OK to reference things that FERC enforcement said to me.  If not, I'll take that out of the memo.  This list is based on the list that Steve and Rick handed out to FERC?/or Congress? last summer in Washington. 
Per Jim's request for the database.  (I don't know if you want to put the= =20 values that Kevin is giving into the database). =20 (1)  Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market=20 scheduling proposal.

Thi= s=20 has turned into a very positive process that may result in a new=20 configuration of the NERC relibiability effort. (6) Dick's made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing= =20 their new scheduling procedure (ultimate source and sink) with FERC.  This= =20 was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March 1 without a FERC= =20 filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint=20 situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav= e=20 incurred in the meantime (See Comm. Massey's concurrence in Aquila v. Enter= gy=20 about the lack of incentive to file complaints).  Kevin Presto said that=20 winning the protest at FERC (due 4/12) would be worth $100 MM. (7)  On 2/2, TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from=20 minute by minute to hourly accountability (notably, TECO revised its propos= al=20 before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein.) We worked wi= th=20 EPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECO=01,s proposal.

(8)  FERC issued a NOPR on January 28 proposing to revise the= =20 way it assesses annual charges to public utilities.  Enron, along with=20 several other participants (Dynegy, Koch, APX, Citizens, NP Energy, Sonat a= nd=20 Williams), filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August, 1998,=20 requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges,=20 arguing that FERC's current system of assessing annual charges on sales for= =20 resale of power discourages trading, impedes reliance on competitive market= s=20 for power, and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new= =20 power marketers entering the market.  We proposed that FERC either assess i= ts=20 costs on transmission only, or reallocate the amounts that it collects=20 through sales transactions versus transmission transactions.  Although FERC= =20 does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot, the petition= =20 served its purpose. In the NOPR, FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on=20 transmission issues (a point that we made in the Petition), it is appropria= te=20 to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat= e=20 commerce by public utilities.  Under the current assessment system, FERC=20 divides its costs between transmission and sales.  Now FERC is proposing to= =20 collect its costs solely through transmission.  FERC justifies this change= =20 because it spends most of its time on transmission issues, and because=20 transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges=20 assessed to users of the grid.  FERC proposes to asses its costs to 1)=20 unbundled wholesale transmission; 2) unbundled retail transmission; and 3)= =20 bundled wholesale power sales.  Bundled native load transactions will=20 apparently avoid assessments of any FERC-related costs; however, EPSA and= =20 Enron are protesting this issue at FERC.  (Jim Steffes has been working on = a=20 calculation of additional value.) (9)  Interconnection Policy =01) Utilizing EPSA efforts, including Sarah's= =20 meeting with FERC, we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth (= in=20 the forum we suggested, i.e., an existing proceeding) in the Tennessee Powe= r=20 order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form= a=20 tariff, including that a generator doesn't have to request transmission and= =20 interconnection at the same time.  We worked with EPSA to draft the ""Model""= =20 interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy=20 interconnection proposal.

Kev= in=20 said that AEP's ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR, so this h= as=20 a positive effect not just on AEP, but on all of ECAR. (11) MAPP =01) FERC further order on refunds.  MAPP refused to refund moni= es=20 that it was unable to collect from a non-jurisdictional member transmission= =20 owner, NPPD.  EPMI filed a protest to MAPP=01,s refund report, arguing that= MAPP=20 was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order.  FERC agreed= =20 with Enron and rejected MAPP=01,s refund report.  FERC said MAPP must refun= d the=20 full amount to transmission customers, whether or not it was able to collec= t=20 that money from NPPD.  Results in another $50,000 of refunds for EPMI.

This is an excerpt from FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on RTOs (eventually became Rule 2000).  It references the 3/98 petition that Enron, etal filed at FERC (which includes examples).  I forwarded you the 3/98 petition last week for you to send to Miriam Erickson.  I thought she may be interested in this. 
Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 72 - In March 1998, a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders 113/ filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure. 114/  Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition, the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market.  For example, the Petition asserts: Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing, rather than accommodating, transactions.  Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical, accurate information across control areas.  This can take the form of out-of-date or incorrect postings of ATC or, in some instances, intentional withholding of actual ATC. Regardless of the cause, more transmission capability 111/ Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference, Docket No. RM95-9-003 (July 18, 1997), transcript at 23. 112/ Id. at 28. 113/ The group consists of a number of power marketers and users, including, for example, Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market, ELCON, Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. 114/ Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain Open-Access Commercial Practices, Docket No. RM98-5-000. Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 73 - is physically available than is being released for sale. [115/] The Petition alleges the existence of ""ATC exclusions, inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable access to the grid."" 116/  The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/ EPSA, the trade association representing certain power suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences: EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers, by, for example, minimizing reported available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise manipulating market operations. 118/ EPSA further stated that, ""The manipulation of ATC -- whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS 115/ Petition at 7-8. 116/ Id. at 15. 117/ Id. at Appendix D. 118/ EPSA Comments, Docket No. RM98-5-000, at 2 (filed September 21, 1998). Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 74 - management -- is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers."" 119/ At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans, we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City, Mississippi, of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment: Yazoo City, as a participant, has experienced first hand an individual [transmission] owner's continued ability to use its ownership and control [of] transmission to disadvantage competitors, notwithstanding Order 888's mandate of non-discriminatory transmission access. The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/  The representative concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved ""as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation 
Wed. we will be filing our protest (plus, many others will be filing protests) that Entergy's filing is discriminatory and not the way to solve transmission constraints issues.  Actually, Entergy proposes solving constraint issues by not allowing parking at a generation only control area and by eliminating netting--both items that we won last year at NERC against TVA.  Entergy's filing is a proposal to solve ""partial paths"", which they call ""fictional"" sinks/sources via elimination of the path. Now MAIN and ComEd (specifically stating that it doesn't want us to sink at the Enron soon-to-be control area in ComEd) have raised this issue.  We are working on a response to ComEd and Dick may be going out to meet with them too. Finally, DUKE AND CINERGY both told me that while their marketing/traders greatly want to protest Entergy's filing, their transmission side won't let them.  So both are filing plain vanilla interventions.  We need to again be looking for any NERC email blasters that go out from marketers of utilities now and into the summer, similar to what SCEM (Southern's marketer) sent out last year complaining about TLRs.  If you see any of these, let me know so we can possibly send them to FERC staff because it is very difficult to get them to take a public position.  PECO Energy is filing a good protest to Entergy. C. Patrick Hanse 04/11/2000 07:41 AM 
Christi - FYI for the letter you are preparing for both Entergy and ComEd. Below, Harry Terhune from MAIN org. is advertising Entergy's recent tariff filing to MAIN members as a way to deal with ""partial path"" reservations and valid ATC calculations. 
Rita has been in the Enron litigation unit for a number of years.  She is getting her law degree and wants to continue working at Enron.  If she could assist us anywhere, please contact her.  Thanks. 
A number of parties protested Entergy's Source and Sink filing at FERC based on arguments similar to ours (discriminatory treatment of PTP customers/Generation only control areas approved by NERC).  As you can see, TDUs and utilities joined in on this.: Dynegy Power Marketing Aquila Energy Marketing Peco Energy Co. Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had left SPP) Coral Power, ELCON and Enron VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22 effective date.) Louisiana Energy Users Group Tenaska Power Services El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as ""hubs"" in order to move more toward the gas model) Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for hearing!  (There so far are no filings in support of Entergy.)

This item appeared in The Times & Free Press on Saturday, April 22, 2000. Thought you might be interested in it. Gas Turbines Help Meet New Power Peaks for TVA By DAVE FLESSNER Business Editor The Tennessee Valley Authority hasn't started building any new coal or nuclear power plants in more than 25 years. But the federal utility is still adding to its power to meet the growing demand for electricity. In each of the next three years, TVA is adding eight gas-fired turbines to help meet ever-higher electricity peaks in the summer months. The new units won't run most of the time, unlike the base-load plants erected during the first half-century of TVA's history. But TVA is still spending more than $700 million for all of the new plants and contracting to spend more money buying power from other producers in the Tennessee Valley. ""Our summer peaks are growing from 2 to 3 percent a year and we need these units to meet our power demand,"" said TVA spokesman Gil Francis. ""These are the most reliable and best-cost option for us at this time.""  With an extra 600 megawatts of capacity from eight of the gas- or oil-fired turbines this summer, TVA officials insist they are ready for an expected record-breaking demand for electricity later this year. ""We don't control the weather,"" TVA Senior Vice President Greg Vincent told agency directors earlier this week. ""A real extreme weather event could cause us problems, and a lot of other people problems. But outside of that, we have taken every measure we can.""  TVA consumers demanded a record 28,295 megawatts last July 30 when temperatures across the valley averaged 96 degrees. TVA projects the demand will be up 2 to 3 percent this year because of the growing number of homes, businesses and air conditioners in its 7-state service territory. TVA is adding four gas turbines at both its Gallatin and Johnsonville fossil plants in Tennessee. The turbines will cost about $200 million and give TVA a total of 28.  The agency will build another eight units next summer, and its board on Wednesday approved a $246.8 million contract with General Electric for another 680 megawatts of peaking power from eight more units. Those units, equipped to burn either coal or oil, are scheduled to come on line in June 2002.  ""There's a long waiting period for these units, so you've got to get in line to get them ready when you need it,"" Mr. Francis said. But the scheduling and cost for the peaking units is far less than building a major power plant. The Watts Bar Nuclear Power Plant, which TVA began in 1972, wasn't completed until 1996. The Unit 1 reactor alone cost $6 billion to complete.  To pare its $27 billion debt, TVA's board adopted a 10-year plan three years ago to limit new borrowings and to turn to other suppliers or peaking units to meet future energy growth.  Next year, TVA also has contracted to begin buying up to 440 megawatts of power from the Red Hills Power Project, a privately owned, lignite-powered plant in Mississippi. TVA has a backup plan this summer to buy up to $100 million in electricity from outside its system if needed to ensure it has a cushion of about 16 percent, Mr. Vincent said.  Drought conditions that could have limited power generation from TVA's 29 hydro units eased some with early April rains. However, valley rainfall still stands about 11/2 inches below normal for the year. Gary L.

Update:  Based on Charles' great MRD presentation to Power Trading, the traders have some ideas about this.  I'll provide more info as soon as I get it from them. 
We need to determine whether Enron should work toward a bulletin board for MRD on Enron Online if OATI is already working on one.  If so, we would need to act quickly in order to compete with OATI for the summer (if we even want to do that since OATI had a very good tagging agent that Enron's tagging system really didn't compete with).  OATI already has the online auctioneer and is working on adding the MRD bids/offers. Also, if Enron Online wants Enron in the middle of every transaction as a sleeve (unlike a third party bid/offer platform), then we need to consider that since all MRD transactions are physical, this will add to the FERC costs that Enron will pay (at least until we get a final rule from FERC on costs). Additionally, the market may not take to MRD as well if Enron is the sleeve on all transactions. 
The OATI folks have been pretty cose to the NERC MRD activities. I have provided Nelson Mueller (OATI) with some thoughts on how to simplify the MRD set-up process.  (This involves the steps marketers must perform to figure out what generation and how much is needed for redispatch.) I knew that OATI has been responsive to facilitating the MRD procedures in the ETAG software and were interested in being a bulletin board for the bids and offers.  However, would OATI provide more than just a bulletin board?  I suspect they will not back up these products financially llike Enron OnLine could. Additionally, NSP's generator marketer has asked me if our traders would be interested in a ""contracted one-stop"" MRD service utilizing NSP's uncommitted reserve generation capability.  These units are on the ""good"" side of the Eau-Claire Arpin interface in MAPP/MAIN.  I will offer this in my presentation tomorrow to the traders. 
Charles--The OATI group was here today to teach EPMI about the OATI products that we are using.  OATI said that it is investigating whether to implement a generation bid/offer service platform on OATI.  Charles--Any thoughts? Note:  The fact that Enron has contracted with OATI for services is 
Below is the filing Enron made yesterday protesting Entergy Power Marketing's request to continue Market Based Rates.  Aquila and Dynegy also filed good protests.  I will separately email the charts that were attached to Enron's filing once I receive them later today. Also, Enron has filed (1) a protest of Entergy's request to require ""ultimate"" ""Valid"" source and sink (no sinks to generation only control areas) on all reservations and (2) comments on Entergy's proposed interconnection procedures and agreement (note: this was struck from FERC's agenda yesterday).  Let me know if you need copies of those two filings. 
- ENTERGY.doc - NEPOOL.doc 
Attached are the Figures and Tables for the Entergy Filing.  The first document should be all of the figures, and the rest should be each table in chronological order.  Andrea - 3ZLB01_.XLS - 3ZLC01_.XLS - 3ZLD01_.XLS - 3ZLF01_.XLS - 3ZLG01_.XLS - 3ZLX01_.XLS 
I reviewed the ECAR filing.  ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an ECAR control area.  I generally think it is a good filing and of importance because it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a region has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, reliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).  The compensation between ECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the grid.  It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to participate. Inadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.  The NERC performance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short parties.  Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the long party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation price for power) + 10% penalty.  A $15/MW offset is used as the price of power repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC settlement procedures.  Price information is confidential. The ECAR dispute resolution procedure is applicable (binding ADR is voluntary).  Parties retain the right to go directly to FERC. Lloyd -- Are you OK with the specifics? I do not see any reason to protest this.  EPSA wants to use the $15 offset to show what may be reasonable for generator interconnects and I am discussing it with EPSA.  We should file a routine intervention (to obtain pleadings, orders, etc.)  Interventions are due Friday, May 5. Anyone disagree? Dave Mangskau@ENRON 04/20/2000 04:58 PM 
Christi: for your info if you plan to file in support of this ECAR action, as Enron's rep to ECAR  I discussed this internally and have been supportive of a final product that includes sanctions.  Enron is not a voting member nor were we given an opportunity to make changes to the final document that went out for ballot..........but it was similar to what was discussed in recent ECAR meetings and was finalized after ECAR reps met with FERC staff to meet FERC concerns. In addition, several weeks ago I presented the ECAR concept to the MAPP Executive Committee and after discussion MAPP passed a resolution of support for what ECAR was trying to accomplish to improve reliability.   In order to make a payment sanction for inadvertent really work, it should be approved by an entire interconnection.  ECAR officials are expecting approval very quickly so that sanctions are in place this summer to help support reliability. If Enron has changed its position, and we plan to oppose this action, lets discuss the ramifications including putting at risk the expected Executive Board action on May 1 to ratify CRC and OP & L recommendations to grant conditional certification of our two control areas in ECAR.                    thanx 
ECAR actually filed this at FERC already this week.  I am getting a copy of the filing.  We will have an opportunity to respond to it at FERC. 
** PRIVATE ** ECAR has filed a Section 205 request for Commission approval of an ""Inadvertent Settlement Tariff.""  The Tariff is intended to obligate each Party to make payment and to entitle each Party to receive compensation for Inadvertent Interchange from each other Party pursuant to ECAR's Inadvertent Settlement Procedure.  Parties to the settlement include Allegheny Power (Monongahela Power Company, The Potomac Edison Company, and West Penn Power Company), American Electric Power Co., Big Rivers Electric Corp., Cinergy Corp., Consumers Energy Co., The Dayton Power and Light Co., The Detroit Edison Co., Duquesne Light Co., East Kentucky Power Cooperative, Inc., FirstEnergy Corp., Hoosier Energy REC, Indianapolis Power and Light Co., LG&E Energy Corp., Northern Indiana Public Service Co., Ohio Valley Electric Corp., and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co. I will let you know when this gets noticed. 
TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source and sink filing. TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to the Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members ""predisposed to Enron's point of view.""  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy. Finally, TVA understands that ""Enron has prevented SERC"" from bringing the matter to NERC ADR. Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them on non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability until the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system (although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, I question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy also states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in case the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often does this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to check all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of timely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even analyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the tags now), Entergy says this is ""irrelevant"", but TLRs will be improved. Entergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that ""EPSA has not made a compelling argument that disclosure would harm liquidity.""  I think that the compelling arguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC approved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them and the tags don't require them. Entergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar information was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even so, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it inconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.) Finally, Entergy says that we can always put in ""anticipated"" source and sink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding that even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the power flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority. We are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the reliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material issue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least. 
Way to go ISO-NE!  Hats off to Dan Allegretti for nurturing this outcome! 
Jeff -- The region of MAIN sent a letter to NERC asking that the NERC Security Comm. make a new interpretation about reserving ATC and scheduling to a generation control area (since we will have the new Enron control area in MAIN within 2 weeks).  MAIN is trying to prohibit us from using our new control area as a source or sink.  Attached is Enron's response to NERC and Howard Hawks asking the PITF to tell MAIN that this issue has already been decided in last year's win over TVA.  A copy of MAIN's letter to NERC is 
APX's presentation about purchasing transmission rights over constrained flowgates.  Discussed at Dynegy last week and to be presented to FERC on May 24 by APX. 
On 5/17/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement (""IA"") and procedures subject to modification.  As I mentioned earlier, Entergy had adopted some of Enron's suggestion (in Enron's comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of generation. All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not included with an interconnection request. Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale, as well as unbundled retail. Dismisses EPSA's call for a ""model"" and approves Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement, subject to modification. Agreed with Enron that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence). Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to the IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions. Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate ""receipt"" of power without expansion, the new generator must pay costs of expansion. Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure ""interconnection"" and which are applicable when transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS). Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provide a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines). If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide. FERC will not initiate a ""generic"" proceeding at this time, but encourages all transmission providers to file procedures at FERC. Approves Entergy's credits for ""optional"" upgrades (required to transport power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work. Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subsequent studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator may be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  This is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS. Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating. Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, unless actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of studies). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency (or explain why that is inappropriate). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generator pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system. Entergy must submit a compliance tariff within 30 days.  Let me know if you 
This talks about the need for the proposed merchant generation to be built, so Dan W. is including this in the Entergy rehearing. 
On 6/2/00, Enron participated in EPSA's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Industry Reliability Efforts for the summer (attached).  On 5/17/00, FERC issued streamlined market based rates filings for industrials with on-site generation to sell into the grid, decreased approval requirements for utility deals with customers to interrupt load, more FERC hotline staff, and better updates of ATC.  In addition to FERC's proposals and requests for additional ideas, EPSA commented: Need robust competitive market to incentivize new generation Overall big requests--eliminate CBM, require independent ATC calculations, require independent Security Coordinators, and native load under same tariff Specific suggested fixes for this summer: (1) Require transmission providers to give written notice to FERC and post

FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of      information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation. Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.)) Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers includes similar procedures. What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can result in loss of queue spot. Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.

I attended the kick off and coordinator committee meetings for UW today.  The ""Who wants to help Millions"" game begins next Wed. (7/19) via email.  I think Steve could encourage participation from his group with an email sent out Tues. 7/18 similar to this: 
Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions? Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items). Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes.  I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN! Other items: Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring and other activites during the year.  Other Enron business units will choose other UW agencies to sponsor through activities. We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign.  Do we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on August 9?  We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants. 
Attached is our brief protest of the merger asking FERC to condition approval on FPL and Entergy joining viable RTOs that include a real time energy market and transmission type/congestion hedging tools (we cite to our previously filed protests of Entergy and FPL's market based rates).  We also ask that a grid operator (MISO or PJM) be established over the entities to the extent that they are not in a viable fully functioning RTO by the merger approval date.   We also reserve our right to file additional data on problems with the merger, if necessary. 
Attached is EPMI's protest of GridFlorida's amended Dec. 15 filing.  We protested: Certain Governance provisions The allocation to the utilities of the PTRs (physical transmission rights) The balanced day ahead scheduling requirement (telling FERC that it should require a real time energy market instead) Suggest an alternative approach to the ICAP market in which the ICAP is monitored and a market only established after the icap drops (incentivizing the LSEs to keep their reserves at the required level) 
Effective February 13, FERC approved the Southern Source and Sink restrictions, without comment other than stating that they mirrored Entergy's restrictions, approved last year.  Commissioner Massey concurred stating that this order is consistent with the Entergy precedent; however, he reiterated that this shows a flaw in OATT structure that gives LSEs a competitive advantage.  Massey calls on the RTO proposals to remedy this flaw. Other issues: Approved Interconnection procedures w/ these changes: -- While interconnection conveys no delivery service (must reserve transmission through OASIS), interconnection conveys an ongoing right to access the transmission system at the receipt point -- Requires Southern to provide credits for upgrades and explain its policy (interconnection customers only required to pay for ""but for"" interconnection costs) -- Southern will post required generator information on its OASIS and will allow customers 15 days to respond to requests for additional information without losing the queue position -- Cutoff for additional studies is execution of interconnection agreement (or date of filing unexecuted agreement) -- Identities of generators will not be posted on the queue Approved creditworthiness procedures with a credit quality of BBB+/Baa1 (LCs, guaranty, prepayment also allowed) Copy of order is attached. - ER01-668.00A.WPD 
Richard--Joe has some ideas about this and will get back with you (and submit the RCR). ""Tabors, Richard"" <tabors@tca-us.com> on 07/18/2000 06:05:36 PM 
Christi, Jim, et al This last exchange has been very helpful.  The question that we need some guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with the results.  There are at least two levels that we could look at effectively. 1.  Fairly quickly, a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of '98 when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest.  It would need to focus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today (along with the midwest) and also get a glimmer on (rumor picked up here) the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers.  The conclusion from '98 was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for both generation additions and for DSM investments (load response). Presumably this would carry forward to a 2000 study. 2.  A more careful look at the same areas described above but more focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers.  WE covered this only in a cursory fashion in '98.  Here we would need to do two things.  The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folks understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions (the lesson of 
Thanks, Jim--Dan Larcamp seemed to genuinely want to learn what the problems are and to educate his staff.  In that regard, we have offered to have some of his staff down to use some of Enron's tools.  He was specifically asking for the data below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps.  I didn't get a feeling that he would use the data to say that everything is fine.  In fact, we took him through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a ""seminar"" type activity for some of his senior staffers.  He is in the process of bringing on some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues, etc.  He was very familiar with the other problems on the grid. He also asked Kevin why Enron doesn't want LMP everywhere because with our staffing we can run over everyone else.  Kevin told him that then there is no market liquidity and we can't trade with ourselves.  As it is now, there are less than 10 big players due to the transmission risk.  We explained in detail what happens in the ""Into"" Markets and why it is so difficult to deal with transmission/physical risk.  Kevin said that even the big bank players, like Morgan Stanley, usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation so they do not have to take transmission risk.  Dan L., having come from gas, understood the liquidity issues and had a good discussion with Kevin.  (He sat down in Kevin's chair and looked at pricing on EOL.) Overall, it was a very positive meeting.  Kevin was impressed that Dan L. really understood the issues and acted like he wanted to do something, but needed help in educating his people. James D Steffes@EES 07/18/2000 04:00 PM 
Christi, etal -- I don't disagree with this analysis, but the drive for competitive generation is not simply related to the short term benefits (one year total energy bill versus next year total energy bill).  Competitive generation is also about risk transfer - regulated monopolies assign all new plant risk to customers, merchant generation assigns all new plant risk to shareholders. In addition, I hope that Larcamp won't take our data / analysis and try to argue that ""everything is fine"".  Clearly there are many undone / misdone public policy problems (e.g., native load exception, hourly transmission, etc.) left in the wholesale energy markets. Jim 
Richard T. -- Dan Larcamp of FERC was here today and asked for a comprehensive, real price study using data from last summer or the last two summers showing how much on a $kw basis that retail customers were affected by the price spikes (including how much they saved as a result of hopefully lower prices for the remainder of the year.)  He needs this to fight price caps.  How much would something like that cost (probably using some of the data you gathered last year.)?  How long would it take to create?  Thanks for your help. 
The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected two key elements of Southern Company Services, Inc.'s proposed Regional Transmission Organzation (RTO) and encouraged the company to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO for the Southeast. The Commission did not act on other issues raised by Southern. Southern's proposal for a for-profit gridco (grid company) that would include only new wholesale transmission services and have the benefits of certain rate incentives going to others rather than the RTO operator are inconsistent with FERC's RTO policy, the Commission said. Under Southern's proposal, existing owners' transmission facilities related to bundled retail service or native load would not be under the gridco's control. As a result, the vast majority of total transmission load would not be under the RTO's tariff, operation or direction. The RTO rule requires all transmission facilities operate under the transco. In addition, Southern could not plan, design and operate a regional grid in a manner that maximizes efficiency if the transco controlled only a small part of the RTO load, the Commission said in rejecting Southern's proposal. As an alternative to filing a revised RTO proposal, the Commission asked that Southern consider joining neighboring utilities in an RTO in the Southeast. The Commission directed Southern to file a report by July 13, 2001, on progress in forming a Southeastern RTO. 
On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO. Some positive aspects for EPMI: States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has ""theoretical merit"", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented. Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval.

AEP, ComEd, Duke and CP&L announced last week that they would be collaborating on a new version of a net based system better than OASIS.  I think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this.  There may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use: On 7/14, FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by 2/15/01 on OASIS Phase II (the new OASIS proposal).  In particular, FERC states that this new OASIS should address: (i) communication of critical market information (like transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs).  FERC says that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc. FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.) This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked out after the first denial for lack of ATC.)  FERC also wants information on whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that should be standardized. Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is available today.  (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted--FERC has not adopted that idea yet.) Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be very likely to be adopted (with some changes).  I think it is better to be in on the front end.  Enron's participation would also give validity to their system. Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more ""classes"" for his staff from Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky told Dan L. that ""AEP has nothing to hide.""  This type of venture would allow AEP one venue to make good on that statement. Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system. This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc. 
I talked with Dan briefly about this to verify my conclusion that FERC would not get involved at this point.  The Florida issue seems similar to California (or any other state that has idiosyncratic siting issues) in that FERC has encouraged California to speed the siting of generation, but has not ordered it.  What I am not sure about is whether the possible DOE or Congressional emergency electricity legislation that Jim sent out yesterday (on demand side management payments) could also include language that would allow the federal government to override the certain state generation siting issues, such as the Florida law.

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while maybe the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and adopt everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the ISO being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion occurs.  While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to all the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the information about congestion from the past several years, they could essentially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade ""above"" the underlying FTRs as financial instruments. Steve Walton 06/18/2001 03:30 PM 
Jim, I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the ""Adopt PJM"" approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time changing horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of government. The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -- none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful. During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that a centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PNW) with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro-thermal operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW operations and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commitment.  Given other work and travel, it has taken some time to complete the paper and its examples.  I hope this will help to explain why I am hesitant to endorse a centralize unit commitment implementation.

FYI.  This is exciting! 
On 7/31/00, FERC approved SPP's interconnection procedures.  Items of interest: Third party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and Customer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in any instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion. The current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if someone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing customer should pay for any new studies required by others.) While SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60 days, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is reasonably needed.) If transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs of upgrades that are needed ""but for"" the interconnection.  However, once transmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the network upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the expansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines. Typically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to the interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on OASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which benefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all customers. Let me know if you would like a copy of the order. 
Betsy and I talked about this today and I told her to send it to FERC.  This shows that the most TLRs were called by AEP as security coordinator in Summer 2000.

On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.

Steve Whitley told Dick Ingersoll yesterday that TVA would implement the NERC letter by Monday.  TVA said it was increasing the scheduling deadlines for within day multiple hour schedules to 90 minutes ahead for everyone.  Next hour would continue to be 30 minutes (which TVA changed to this summer from 20 min.).  The new tagging deadlines are supposed to be posted on TVA's OASIS 
On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi= cs=20 similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with = a=20 reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the=20 regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a=20 traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the= =20 commodity and services. =20 DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,=20 transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission=20 Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such= ,=20 they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic= e=20 to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff= =20 received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information=20 available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated=20 incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lac= k=20 of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan= ts=20 to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. = =20 TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an=20 ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from= =20 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. = =20 Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with=20 virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were= =20 highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and=20 another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even= =20 though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment= ,=20 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The= =20 total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are= =20 not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose=20 procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commissi= on=20 has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open=20 Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to= =20 enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission= =20 has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,=20 including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market=20 because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an= =20 inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  I= n=20 addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase= d=20 loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one=20 control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for=20 price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants belie= ve=20 that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction= =20 increased in the Midwest. =20 Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of informati= on=20 in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules fo= r=20 service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission=20 access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a= nd=20 protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and=20 discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,= =20 such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs= =20 were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market=20 inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully= =20 analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk advers= e,=20 eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted th= at=20 because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed= =20 incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the=20 IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching= =20 the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,=20 particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided= =20 to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp= er=20 implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, al= l=20 three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and= =20 native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO=20 exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security=20 coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region= =20 of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  Th= e=20 result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. = =20 Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC aud= it=20 this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is=20 weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of=20 liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially= =20 on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several are= as=20 of non-compliance. =20 Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,= =20 with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flo= w=20 input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information= =20 transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under= =20 RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a=20 consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption= =20 and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission coul= d=20 benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t= he=20 TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also= ,=20 Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits= =20 or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to ha= ve=20 the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha= ve=20 against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide= =20 variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20 region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20 Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively""=20 receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20 behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. = =20 While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,= =20 there is evidence of discriminatory instances. Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has= =20 largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the= =20 economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs= =20 have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d= ue=20 to the inherent flexibility of the current rules. Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20 transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20 manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20 transmission system and use many TLRs. There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development= =20 of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and= =20 there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices. TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act= ed=20 as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the= =20 SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20 reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20 perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20 interconnection studies. In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20 plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida. Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th= is=20 summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than= =20 the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20 radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20 prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20 generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20 SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20 extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.) The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to= =20 discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S= E=20 (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence= =20 in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20 justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20 discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes= =20 that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20 transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns= =20 that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio= n=20 found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In= =20 addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff= =20 thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. = =20 Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20 jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20 information. The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac= k=20 of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20 addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20 capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20 interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied= =20 Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20 construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.= =20 Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20 self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory. ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20 standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20 direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati= on=20 are needed. The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais= es=20 the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv= e=20 operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20 Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20 criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d= o=20 not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs= =20 must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  = In=20 addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.= =20 However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives. *** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated= =20 weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the= =20 formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i= e,=20 treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20 tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio= n=20 of transparent and standardized information. Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20 ""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20 bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la= w=20 and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of= =20 deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20 incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20 addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list= s=20 a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the= =20 tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park= =20 power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20 development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential= . A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin= g=20 confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan= ge=20 information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available t= o=20 FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an= =20 established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not= =20 displayed in error.

(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition market based rates on RTO participation. GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the ""voluntary"" nature of Order No. 2000. Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is premature due to Southern's ""significant progress"" in developing an RTO. Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating that the Investigation is based on ""perception,"" not fact, and contains conclusions that are ""ill-formed.""  Southern concludes that the ""Southeastern bulk power market worked quite well"" this summer because there were no price spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first. (2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO filing in abeyance: Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the conclusion of the this period. (3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order request that it can be an RTO States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.) (4)  GridSouth response to protests It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership structure of the LLC GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an OATT?) 
Steve--Joe, Rick and I expressed concerns about suing TVA under the NERC ""agreements"".   Richard Sanders wants to have a conference call next week with the outside counsel, Bob Madden. 
ATTORNEY WORK PRIVILEGE NERC is establishing penalties for violations of many of its rules, beginning in 2000.  I have talked with Kevin Presto and the other operators and transmission people and hourly desk repeatedly about this.  Generally, we feel that we can remain in compliance and many of the operational rules are valid for reliability.  However, then we run into the ""interpretation"" issues that have plagued us this summer.  I think one problem is separating the valid ""operational"" reliability rules from the rules (like ATC) that have a huge market impact and can be misinterpreted and manipulated.  Until FERC actually reviews and approves NERC rules, I share Rick and Joe's concerns. Richard Shapiro@EES 12/09/99 12:08 PM 
I have some concern over the impact to us if we were to take the  position you suggest.--  I'm not sure we would be comfortable with NERC rules constituting the equivalent of a contract given how ""wonderful"" so many of their rules are. Will be interested to hear from Joe and Christi. Thanks. 
FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of      information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation. Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.)) Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers includes similar procedures. What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can result in loss of queue spot. Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L 
Attached is our brief protest of the merger asking FERC to condition approval on FPL and Entergy joining viable RTOs that include a real time energy market and transmission type/congestion hedging tools (we cite to our previously filed protests of Entergy and FPL's market based rates).  We also ask that a grid operator (MISO or PJM) be established over the entities to the extent that they are not in a viable fully functioning RTO by the merger approval date.   We also reserve our right to file additional data on problems with the merger, if necessary. 
Attached is EPMI's protest of GridFlorida's amended Dec. 15 filing.  We protested: Certain Governance provisions The allocation to the utilities of the PTRs (physical transmission rights) The balanced day ahead scheduling requirement (telling FERC that it should require a real time energy market instead) Suggest an alternative approach to the ICAP market in which the ICAP is monitored and a market only established after the icap drops (incentivizing the LSEs to keep their reserves at the required level)

I've highlighted the portion of the article that discusses Enron. ******************************************** Tennessee Valley Authority Plans New Natural-Gas Fired Plant Dave Flessner , Chattanooga Times/Free Press ( January 13, 2000 ) Jan. 13--The Tennessee Valley Authority is preparing to locate its first new power plant in a generation. But unlike the massive and controversial nuclear plants TVA proposed in the 1960s, the newest power generating facility will be much smaller and less controversial than any plant TVA has erected in the past half century. TVA is proposing to build a natural gas-fired plant on farmland in Haywood County, Tenn., about 40 miles north of Memphis. TVA has optioned to buy any of three different farms near Brownsville, Tenn., to locate a plant capable of generating between 1,000 megawatts and 1,700 megawatts of electricity. The preferred plant size would be a Westinghouse unit costing TVA over $200 million and capable of generating 1,400 megawatts of power -- slightly more than what each reactor at the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant produces at full power. But the new plant will generate power less than 30 percent of the year when TVA's power demand is at its peak. ""We need additional peaking power in the western portion of our service territory and these sites are well located near natural gas pipelines and one of TVA's 500-kilovolt transmission lines,"" said Roy V. Carter, project leader for the proposed new plant. Mr. Carter said the natural gas-powered plant won't have the pollution problems of either coal or nuclear plants. The new plant would be the first that TVA has ever built not on a river or lake. But the underground water supplies should be adequate since the plant will typically operate only a few hours a day, even during the summer and winter peak demand periods. Environmentalists who have fought TVA's nuclear and coal plants in the past are welcoming the switch to natural gas. ""We support TVA getting a larger share of generation from natural gas because it is a much cleaner source of fuel,"" said Dr. Steve Smith, executive director of the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group. ""We would hope that TVA will try to use these type of plants to replace some of the dirtier coal plants, which are major sources of air pollution in the Valley. These shouldn't just be used to generate more and more power for TVA to sell without any type of demand

Effective February 13, FERC approved the Southern Source and Sink restrictions, without comment other than stating that they mirrored Entergy's restrictions, approved last year.  Commissioner Massey concurred stating that this order is consistent with the Entergy precedent; however, he reiterated that this shows a flaw in OATT structure that gives LSEs a competitive advantage.  Massey calls on the RTO proposals to remedy this flaw. Other issues: Approved Interconnection procedures w/ these changes: -- While interconnection conveys no delivery service (must reserve transmission through OASIS), interconnection conveys an ongoing right to access the transmission system at the receipt point -- Requires Southern to provide credits for upgrades and explain its policy (interconnection customers only required to pay for ""but for"" interconnection costs) -- Southern will post required generator information on its OASIS and will allow customers 15 days to respond to requests for additional information without losing the queue position -- Cutoff for additional studies is execution of interconnection agreement (or date of filing unexecuted agreement) -- Identities of generators will not be posted on the queue Approved creditworthiness procedures with a credit quality of BBB+/Baa1 (LCs, guaranty, prepayment also allowed) Copy of order is attached. - ER01-668.00A.WPD

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected two key elements of Southern Company Services, Inc.'s proposed Regional Transmission Organzation (RTO) and encouraged the company to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO for the Southeast. The Commission did not act on other issues raised by Southern. Southern's proposal for a for-profit gridco (grid company) that would include only new wholesale transmission services and have the benefits of certain rate incentives going to others rather than the RTO operator are inconsistent with FERC's RTO policy, the Commission said. Under Southern's proposal, existing owners' transmission facilities related to bundled retail service or native load would not be under the gridco's control. As a result, the vast majority of total transmission load would not be under the RTO's tariff, operation or direction. The RTO rule requires all transmission facilities operate under the transco. In addition, Southern could not plan, design and operate a regional grid in a manner that maximizes efficiency if the transco controlled only a small part of the RTO load, the Commission said in rejecting Southern's proposal. As an alternative to filing a revised RTO proposal, the Commission asked that Southern consider joining neighboring utilities in an RTO in the Southeast. The Commission directed Southern to file a report by July 13, 2001, on progress in forming a Southeastern RTO. 
On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO. Some positive aspects for EPMI: States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has ""theoretical merit"", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented. Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval.

I talked with Dan briefly about this to verify my conclusion that FERC would not get involved at this point.  The Florida issue seems similar to California (or any other state that has idiosyncratic siting issues) in that FERC has encouraged California to speed the siting of generation, but has not ordered it.  What I am not sure about is whether the possible DOE or Congressional emergency electricity legislation that Jim sent out yesterday (on demand side management payments) could also include language that would allow the federal government to override the certain state generation siting issues, such as the Florida law. 
On 3/30/98, Aquila filed a complaint at FERC against Entergy that Entergy reserved all of the firm import capacity (2000 MW) at four key interfaces, even though Entergy did not designate any off-system network resources to cover these reservations.  Aquila's transmission requests were denied or curtailed causing it to suffer financial losses.  Entergy responded that Aquila had a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" of Order No. 888 et seq. and that a transmission provider may deny tariff requests, if that transmission

Can you please forward this to Miriam Erickson.  It is a Petition for Rulemaking that was filed with FERC 3/98.  Although FERC has not made this filing into a rulemaking, FERC did cite many of the examples in App. D in the RTO NOPR.  I would point out that Order No. 2000 would still not resolve examples like  A.1 unless the ""native load exception"" is removed and all uses of the transmission system are under the same tariff.  I would be happy to 
FYI-- ""E"" in the weekly report is the $5 million FERC penalty against Kinder Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but the FPA has similar penalty provisions for ""knowing and willful"" violations. Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric companies from the new data, it will result in some penalties. 
Attached is the FERC Weekly Report for week ending March 24. Also attached are supporting documents you may be interested in: 
Cynthia -- Attached is a memo (no names basis) with examples of problems EPMI encountered last summer.  You should probably ask Joe to make sure that it is OK to reference things that FERC enforcement said to me.  If not, I'll take that out of the memo.  This list is based on the list that Steve and Rick handed out to FERC?/or Congress? last summer in Washington. 
Per Jim's request for the database.

(6) Dick's made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing= =20 their new scheduling procedure (ultimate source and sink) with FERC.  This= =20 was initially going to be implemented unilaterally March 1 without a FERC= =20 filing and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint=20 situation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav= e=20 incurred in the meantime (See Comm. Massey's concurrence in Aquila v. Enter= gy=20 about the lack of incentive to file complaints).  Kevin Presto said that=20 winning the protest at FERC (due 4/12) would be worth $100 MM. (7)  On 2/2, TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from=20 minute by minute to hourly accountability (notably, TECO revised its propos= al=20 before FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein.)

(8)  FERC issued a NOPR on January 28 proposing to revise the= =20 way it assesses annual charges to public utilities.  Enron, along with=20 several other participants (Dynegy, Koch, APX, Citizens, NP Energy, Sonat a= nd=20 Williams), filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August, 1998,=20 requesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges,=20 arguing that FERC's current system of assessing annual charges on sales for= =20 resale of power discourages trading, impedes reliance on competitive market= s=20 for power, and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new= =20 power marketers entering the market.  We proposed that FERC either assess i= ts=20 costs on transmission only, or reallocate the amounts that it collects=20 through sales transactions versus transmission transactions.  Although FERC= =20 does not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot, the petition= =20 served its purpose. In the NOPR, FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on=20 transmission issues (a point that we made in the Petition), it is appropria= te=20 to assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat= e=20 commerce by public utilities.  Under the current assessment system, FERC=20 divides its costs between transmission and sales.  Now FERC is proposing to= =20 collect its costs solely through transmission.  FERC justifies this change= =20 because it spends most of its time on transmission issues, and because=20 transmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges=20 assessed to users of the grid.  FERC proposes to asses its costs to 1)=20 unbundled wholesale transmission; 2) unbundled retail transmission; and 3)= =20 bundled wholesale power sales.  Bundled native load transactions will=20 apparently avoid assessments of any FERC-related costs; however, EPSA and= =20 Enron are protesting this issue at FERC.  (Jim Steffes has been working on = a=20 calculation of additional value.) (9)  Interconnection Policy =01) Utilizing EPSA efforts, including Sarah's= =20 meeting with FERC, we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth (= in=20 the forum we suggested, i.e., an existing proceeding) in the Tennessee Powe= r=20 order where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form= a=20 tariff, including that a generator doesn't have to request transmission and= =20 interconnection at the same time.  We worked with EPSA to draft the ""Model""= =20 interconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy=20 interconnection proposal. (10)  AEP/CSW order =01) approved the merger but accepted intervenors=01,= =20 testimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent=20 calculation of ATC postings (which we proposed) and independent market=20 monitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by 12/15/01. = =20 Kevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth $20 MM to Enron.= =20 (Note: we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP, which AEP chose.).  Kev= in=20 said that AEP's ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR, so this h= as=20 a positive effect not just on AEP, but on all of ECAR. (11) MAPP =01) FERC further order on refunds.  MAPP refused to refund moni= es=20 that it was unable to collect from a non-jurisdictional member transmission= =20 owner, NPPD.  EPMI filed a protest to MAPP=01,s refund report, arguing that= MAPP=20 was ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order.  FERC agreed= =20 with Enron and rejected MAPP=01,s refund report.  FERC said MAPP must refun= d the=20 full amount to transmission customers, whether or not it was able to collec= t=20 that money from NPPD.  Results in another $50,000 of refunds for EPMI.

FYI. 
This is an excerpt from FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on RTOs (eventually became Rule 2000).  It references the 3/98 petition that Enron, etal filed at FERC (which includes examples).  I forwarded you the 3/98 petition last week for you to send to Miriam Erickson.  I thought she may be interested in this. 
Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 72 - In March 1998, a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders 113/ filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure. 114/  Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition, the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market.  For example, the Petition asserts: Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing, rather than accommodating, transactions.  Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical, accurate information across control areas.  This can take the form of out-of-date or incorrect postings of ATC or, in some instances, intentional withholding of actual ATC. Regardless of the cause, more transmission capability 111/ Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference, Docket No. RM95-9-003 (July 18, 1997), transcript at 23. 112/ Id. at 28. 113/ The group consists of a number of power marketers and users, including, for example, Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market, ELCON, Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. 114/ Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain Open-Access Commercial Practices, Docket No. RM98-5-000. Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 73 - is physically available than is being released for sale. [115/] The Petition alleges the existence of ""ATC exclusions, inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable access to the grid."" 116/  The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/ EPSA, the trade association representing certain power suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences: EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers, by, for example, minimizing reported available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise manipulating market operations. 118/ EPSA further stated that, ""The manipulation of ATC -- whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS 115/ Petition at 7-8. 116/ Id. at 15. 117/ Id. at Appendix D. 118/ EPSA Comments, Docket No. RM98-5-000, at 2 (filed September 21, 1998).

The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/  The representative concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved ""as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation

A number of parties protested Entergy's Source and Sink filing at FERC based on arguments similar to ours (discriminatory treatment of PTP customers/Generation only control areas approved by NERC).  As you can see, TDUs and utilities joined in on this.: Dynegy Power Marketing Aquila Energy Marketing Peco Energy Co. Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had left SPP) Coral Power, ELCON and Enron VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22 effective date.) Louisiana Energy Users Group Tenaska Power Services El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as ""hubs"" in order to move more toward the gas model) Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for hearing!  (There so far are no filings in support of Entergy.)

This item appeared in The Times & Free Press on Saturday, April 22, 2000. Thought you might be interested in it. Gas Turbines Help Meet New Power Peaks for TVA By DAVE FLESSNER Business Editor The Tennessee Valley Authority hasn't started building any new coal or nuclear power plants in more than 25 years. But the federal utility is still adding to its power to meet the growing demand for electricity. In each of the next three years, TVA is adding eight gas-fired turbines to help meet ever-higher electricity peaks in the summer months. The new units won't run most of the time, unlike the base-load plants erected during the first half-century of TVA's history. But TVA is still spending more than $700 million for all of the new plants and contracting to spend more money buying power from other producers in the Tennessee Valley. ""Our summer peaks are growing from 2 to 3 percent a year and we need these units to meet our power demand,"" said TVA spokesman Gil Francis. ""These are the most reliable and best-cost option for us at this time.""  With an extra 600 megawatts of capacity from eight of the gas- or oil-fired turbines this summer, TVA officials insist they are ready for an expected record-breaking demand for electricity later this year. ""We don't control the weather,"" TVA Senior Vice President Greg Vincent told agency directors earlier this week. ""A real extreme weather event could cause us problems, and a lot of other people problems. But outside of that, we have taken every measure we can.""  TVA consumers demanded a record 28,295 megawatts last July 30 when temperatures across the valley averaged 96 degrees. TVA projects the demand will be up 2 to 3 percent this year because of the growing number of homes, businesses and air conditioners in its 7-state service territory. TVA is adding four gas turbines at both its Gallatin and Johnsonville fossil plants in Tennessee. The turbines will cost about $200 million and give TVA a total of 28.  The agency will build another eight units next summer, and its board on Wednesday approved a $246.8 million contract with General Electric for another 680 megawatts of peaking power from eight more units. Those units, equipped to burn either coal or oil, are scheduled to come on line in June 2002.  ""There's a long waiting period for these units, so you've got to get in line to get them ready when you need it,"" Mr. Francis said. But the scheduling and cost for the peaking units is far less than building a major power plant. The Watts Bar Nuclear Power Plant, which TVA began in 1972, wasn't completed until 1996. The Unit 1 reactor alone cost $6 billion to complete.  To pare its $27 billion debt, TVA's board adopted a 10-year plan three years ago to limit new borrowings and to turn to other suppliers or peaking units to meet future energy growth.  Next year, TVA also has contracted to begin buying up to 440 megawatts of power from the Red Hills Power Project, a privately owned, lignite-powered plant in Mississippi. TVA has a backup plan this summer to buy up to $100 million in electricity from outside its system if needed to ensure it has a cushion of about 16 percent, Mr. Vincent said.  Drought conditions that could have limited power generation from TVA's 29 hydro units eased some with early April rains. However, valley rainfall still stands about 11/2 inches below normal for the year. Gary L.

Below is the filing Enron made yesterday protesting Entergy Power Marketing's request to continue Market Based Rates.  Aquila and Dynegy also filed good protests.  I will separately email the charts that were attached to Enron's filing once I receive them later today. Also, Enron has filed (1) a protest of Entergy's request to require ""ultimate"" ""Valid"" source and sink (no sinks to generation only control areas) on all reservations and (2) comments on Entergy's proposed interconnection procedures and agreement (note: this was struck from FERC's agenda yesterday).  Let me know if you need copies of those two filings. 
- ENTERGY.doc - NEPOOL.doc 
Attached are the Figures and Tables for the Entergy Filing.  The first document should be all of the figures, and the rest should be each table in chronological order.  Andrea - 3ZLB01_.XLS - 3ZLC01_.XLS - 3ZLD01_.XLS - 3ZLF01_.XLS - 3ZLG01_.XLS - 3ZLX01_.XLS 
TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source and sink filing. TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to the Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members ""predisposed to Enron's point of view.""  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy. Finally, TVA understands that ""Enron has prevented SERC"" from bringing the matter to NERC ADR. Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them on non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability until the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system (although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, I question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy also states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in case the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often does this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to check all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of timely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even analyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the tags now), Entergy says this is ""irrelevant"", but TLRs will be improved. Entergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that ""EPSA has not made a compelling argument that disclosure would harm liquidity.""  I think that the compelling arguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC approved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them and the tags don't require them. Entergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar information was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even so, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it inconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.) Finally, Entergy says that we can always put in ""anticipated"" source and sink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding that even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the power flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority. We are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the reliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material issue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least. 
Way to go ISO-NE!  Hats off to Dan Allegretti for nurturing this outcome! 
Jeff -- The region of MAIN sent a letter to NERC asking that the NERC Security Comm. make a new interpretation about reserving ATC and scheduling to a generation control area (since we will have the new Enron control area in MAIN within 2 weeks).  MAIN is trying to prohibit us from using our new control area as a source or sink.  Attached is Enron's response to NERC and Howard Hawks asking the PITF to tell MAIN that this issue has already been decided in last year's win over TVA.  A copy of MAIN's letter to NERC is 
APX's presentation about purchasing transmission rights over constrained flowgates.  Discussed at Dynegy last week and to be presented to FERC on May 24 by APX. 
On 5/17/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement (""IA"") and procedures subject to modification.  As I mentioned earlier, Entergy had adopted some of Enron's suggestion (in Enron's comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of generation. All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not included with an interconnection request. Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale, as well as unbundled retail. Dismisses EPSA's call for a ""model"" and approves Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement, subject to modification. Agreed with Enron that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence). Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to the IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions. Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate ""receipt"" of power without expansion, the new generator must pay costs of expansion. Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure ""interconnection"" and which are applicable when transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS). Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provide a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines). If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide. FERC will not initiate a ""generic"" proceeding at this time, but encourages all transmission providers to file procedures at FERC. Approves Entergy's credits for ""optional"" upgrades (required to transport power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work. Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subsequent studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator may be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  This is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS. Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating. Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, unless actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of studies). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency (or explain why that is inappropriate). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generator pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system. Entergy must submit a compliance tariff within 30 days.  Let me know if you 
This talks about the need for the proposed merchant generation to be built, so Dan W. is including this in the Entergy rehearing. 
On 6/2/00, Enron participated in EPSA's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Industry Reliability Efforts for the summer (attached).  On 5/17/00, FERC issued streamlined market based rates filings for industrials with on-site generation to sell into the grid, decreased approval requirements for utility deals with customers to interrupt load, more FERC hotline staff, and better updates of ATC.  In addition to FERC's proposals and requests for additional ideas, EPSA commented: Need robust competitive market to incentivize new generation Overall big requests--eliminate CBM, require independent ATC calculations, require independent Security Coordinators, and native load under same tariff Specific suggested fixes for this summer: (1) Require transmission providers to give written notice to FERC and post

I attended the kick off and coordinator committee meetings for UW today.  The ""Who wants to help Millions"" game begins next Wed. (7/19) via email.  I think Steve could encourage participation from his group with an email sent out Tues. 7/18 similar to this: 
Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions? Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items). Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes.  I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN! Other items: Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring and other activites during the year.  Other Enron business units will choose other UW agencies to sponsor through activities. We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign.  Do we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on August 9?  We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants. 
AEP, ComEd, Duke and CP&L announced last week that they would be collaborating on a new version of a net based system better than OASIS.  I think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this.  There may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use: On 7/14, FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by 2/15/01 on OASIS Phase II (the new OASIS proposal).  In particular, FERC states that this new OASIS should address: (i) communication of critical market information (like transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs).  FERC says that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc. FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.) This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked out after the first denial for lack of ATC.)  FERC also wants information on whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that should be standardized. Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is available today.  (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted--FERC has not adopted that idea yet.) Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be very likely to be adopted (with some changes).  I think it is better to be in on the front end.  Enron's participation would also give validity to their system. Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more ""classes"" for his staff from Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky told Dan L. that ""AEP has nothing to hide.""  This type of venture would allow AEP one venue to make good on that statement. Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system. This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.

This is an excerpt from FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on RTOs (eventually became Rule 2000).  It references the 3/98 petition that Enron, etal filed at FERC (which includes examples).  I forwarded you the 3/98 petition last week for you to send to Miriam Erickson.  I thought she may be interested in this. 
Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 72 - In March 1998, a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders 113/ filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure. 114/  Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition, the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market.  For example, the Petition asserts: Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing, rather than accommodating, transactions.  Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical, accurate information across control areas.  This can take the form of out-of-date or incorrect postings of ATC or, in some instances, intentional withholding of actual ATC. Regardless of the cause, more transmission capability 111/ Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference, Docket No. RM95-9-003 (July 18, 1997), transcript at 23. 112/ Id. at 28. 113/ The group consists of a number of power marketers and users, including, for example, Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market, ELCON, Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. 114/ Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain Open-Access Commercial Practices, Docket No. RM98-5-000. Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 73 - is physically available than is being released for sale. [115/] The Petition alleges the existence of ""ATC exclusions, inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable access to the grid."" 116/  The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/ EPSA, the trade association representing certain power suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences: EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers, by, for example, minimizing reported available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise manipulating market operations. 118/ EPSA further stated that, ""The manipulation of ATC -- whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS 115/ Petition at 7-8. 116/ Id. at 15. 117/ Id. at Appendix D. 118/ EPSA Comments, Docket No. RM98-5-000, at 2 (filed September 21, 1998). Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 74 - management -- is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers."" 119/ At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans, we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City, Mississippi, of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment: Yazoo City, as a participant, has experienced first hand an individual [transmission] owner's continued ability to use its ownership and control [of] transmission to disadvantage competitors, notwithstanding Order 888's mandate of non-discriminatory transmission access. The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/  The representative concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved ""as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation 
NOTE TO STEVE, RICK, JOE AND JIM -- ENRON CONTINUES TO HAVE ISSUES WITH INTERCONNECTION.  THE FERC STAFF INVESTIGATION ALSO SAID THAT INTERCONNECTION POLICY (OR LACK THEREOF) CAN BE USED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER.  DO NOT NAME VEPCO, BUT THIS IS A VERY RECENT EXAMPLE THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DISCUSS AT LUNCH.  The developers are working to fix this with VEPCO commercial people, so I have not been asked to call FERC yet. --------- I discussed this with developer, Reagan Rorschach today.  Enron was working with VEPCO to site an IPP (Enron owned) in VEPCO.  We did not come to terms on the PPA this summer.  Enron would like to keep its ability to site the plant with the associated queue position.  VEPCO basically has ""tied"" our queue position to a PPA with VEPCO and, therefore, kicked Enron out of the queue when we did not execute a PPA. VEPCO recently filed interconnection procedures with FERC that have not been approved yet (these procedures were not in place when we got in the queue--there were only very general ""ask to interconnect"" procedures then). The only place that any ""milestones"" are mentioned is in the Interconnection Agreement (which, of course, VEPCO and Enron never executed).  In addition, a generator can lose its queue stop for ""material changes"" to the project. Several parties protested this very loose terminology, but we do not know what FERC will say.  By way of comparison, Consumers recently filed procedures that state ""material changes"" mean increases in MWs > 15% or increasing the in service date by more than 6 months.  This issue will be significant because if we get our queue spot back (which I think we should), we may change the configuration (or a purchaser could change).  I think that reductions in MWs or more stable configurations should not be considered ""material changes.""  Reagan is going to speak with the commercial VEPCO people and I'll call their attorney if necessary. In any event, this again is an example of the kind of problems independent generators continue to face until FERC establishes some general procedures or an interconnection rulemaking.

Sarah and Christi-- I have been working with Jeffrey Keenan and Reagan Rorschack on a power plant in NC.  This plant is in the VEPCO service territory, and so they want to interconnect with VEPCO.  Originally, they were working on a PPA with VEPCO, but this PPA fell apart in October.  VEPCO now claims that because the deal fell apart, our plant should be removed from the queue. If we are removed from the queue, we will fall behind a 640 MW plant in the same area of northern NC.  This is of great concern to the developers because they are afraid that there will be no move available transmission in this area of the grid. They are looking at a number of possible avenues of recourse.  They have started to talk with me regarding handling this on a state level with the NC PSC.  But, I think that this is probably a federal issue. Do you think that this should be handled on a federal level or on the state level?  Please let me know ASAP.  Thank you. Tom Chapman IF you need more information, let me know. 
Tom and Cynthia--The SE reports includes some dings against TVA. On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services. DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance. Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.

On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO. Some positive aspects for EPMI: States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has ""theoretical merit"", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented. Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected two key elements of Southern Company Services, Inc.'s proposed Regional Transmission Organzation (RTO) and encouraged the company to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO for the Southeast. The Commission did not act on other issues raised by Southern. Southern's proposal for a for-profit gridco (grid company) that would include only new wholesale transmission services and have the benefits of certain rate incentives going to others rather than the RTO operator are inconsistent with FERC's RTO policy, the Commission said. Under Southern's proposal, existing owners' transmission facilities related to bundled retail service or native load would not be under the gridco's control. As a result, the vast majority of total transmission load would not be under the RTO's tariff, operation or direction. The RTO rule requires all transmission facilities operate under the transco. In addition, Southern could not plan, design and operate a regional grid in a manner that maximizes efficiency if the transco controlled only a small part of the RTO load, the Commission said in rejecting Southern's proposal. As an alternative to filing a revised RTO proposal, the Commission asked that Southern consider joining neighboring utilities in an RTO in the Southeast. The Commission directed Southern to file a report by July 13, 2001, on progress in forming a Southeastern RTO. 
Effective February 13, FERC approved the Southern Source and Sink restrictions, without comment other than stating that they mirrored Entergy's restrictions, approved last year.  Commissioner Massey concurred stating that this order is consistent with the Entergy precedent; however, he reiterated that this shows a flaw in OATT structure that gives LSEs a competitive advantage.  Massey calls on the RTO proposals to remedy this flaw. Other issues: Approved Interconnection procedures w/ these changes: -- While interconnection conveys no delivery service (must reserve transmission through OASIS), interconnection conveys an ongoing right to access the transmission system at the receipt point -- Requires Southern to provide credits for upgrades and explain its policy (interconnection customers only required to pay for ""but for"" interconnection costs) -- Southern will post required generator information on its OASIS and will allow customers 15 days to respond to requests for additional information without losing the queue position -- Cutoff for additional studies is execution of interconnection agreement (or date of filing unexecuted agreement) -- Identities of generators will not be posted on the queue Approved creditworthiness procedures with a credit quality of BBB+/Baa1 (LCs, guaranty, prepayment also allowed) Copy of order is attached. - ER01-668.00A.WPD 
Attached is EPMI's protest of GridFlorida's amended Dec. 15 filing.  We protested: Certain Governance provisions The allocation to the utilities of the PTRs (physical transmission rights) The balanced day ahead scheduling requirement (telling FERC that it should require a real time energy market instead) Suggest an alternative approach to the ICAP market in which the ICAP is monitored and a market only established after the icap drops (incentivizing the LSEs to keep their reserves at the required level) 
Attached is our brief protest of the merger asking FERC to condition approval on FPL and Entergy joining viable RTOs that include a real time energy market and transmission type/congestion hedging tools (we cite to our previously filed protests of Entergy and FPL's market based rates).  We also ask that a grid operator (MISO or PJM) be established over the entities to the extent that they are not in a viable fully functioning RTO by the merger approval date.   We also reserve our right to file additional data on problems with the merger, if necessary. 
FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders: EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of generators in the following provisions: -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order to seek interconnection -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot -- Specific milestones must be added -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal) -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator of      information that affects the generator -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation. Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC. ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest. FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.)) Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers includes similar procedures. What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can result in loss of queue spot. Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.

I'll forward his talking points a little closer to= =20 the date.  Please advise if there are any issues or concerns that Stan shou= ld=20 be aware of prior to his visit. Also FYI, FERC contacted INGAA to ask that pipelines call Dan Larcamp in th= e=20 event that they experience any curtailments, supply shortages or other=20 critical operations situations this winter.  FERC wants to hear from the=20 pipelines and have some time to react before they are asked to respond in a= =20 public forum. 
***BELOW ARE SUMMARIES OF THE HELPFUL FERC STAFF INVESTIGATIONS LEAD BY SCO= TT=20 MILLER (WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP) -- BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES = AT=20 LUNCH THURS. 12/7. - MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power=20 Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a= =20 Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff=20 (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of=20 information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss= ed=20 many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller= =20 (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under = no=20 obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically= =20 looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly= ,=20 Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the= =20 Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme= nt=20 for several years: Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by=20 requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other=20 transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to= =20 favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of=20 interconnection requests. While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Sta= ff=20 to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of=20 complaints. The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p= ro=20 forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simp= ly=20 relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and= =20 procedures. Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions=20 pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and import= s=20 and exports. RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as we= ll=20 as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such=20 standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that=20 control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that= =20 each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. =20 Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could= =20 standardize ATC and TTC methodology. Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi= cs=20 similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with = a=20 reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the=20 regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a=20 traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the= =20 commodity and services. =20 DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,=20 transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region): Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission=20 Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such= ,=20 they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic= e=20 to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff= =20 received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information=20 available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated=20 incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lac= k=20 of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan= ts=20 to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. = =20 TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an=20 ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from= =20 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. = =20 Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with=20 virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were= =20 highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and=20 another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even= =20 though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment= ,=20 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The= =20 total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are= =20 not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose=20 procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commissi= on=20 has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open=20 Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to= =20 enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission= =20 has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,=20 including the propriety of TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market=20 because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an= =20 inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  I= n=20 addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase= d=20 loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one=20 control area per RTO. Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for=20 price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants belie= ve=20 that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction= =20 increased in the Midwest. =20 Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of informati= on=20 in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules fo= r=20 service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission=20 access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a= nd=20 protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and=20 discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,= =20 such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs= =20 were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market=20 inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully= =20 analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk advers= e,=20 eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted th= at=20 because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed= =20 incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the=20 IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching= =20 the Rules for Fun and Profit."") Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,=20 particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided= =20 to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp= er=20 implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss. The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, al= l=20 three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and= =20 native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO=20 exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security=20 coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region= =20 of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  Th= e=20 result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. = =20 Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC aud= it=20 this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is=20 weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of=20 liquidity. Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially= =20 on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several are= as=20 of non-compliance. =20 Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,= =20 with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flo= w=20 input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information= =20 transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under= =20 RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a=20 consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption= =20 and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission coul= d=20 benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t= he=20 TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also= ,=20 Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits= =20 or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to ha= ve=20 the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha= ve=20 against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide= =20 variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20 region. Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20 Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively""=20 receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20 behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. = =20 While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,= =20 there is evidence of discriminatory instances. Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has= =20 largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the= =20 economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs= =20 have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d= ue=20 to the inherent flexibility of the current rules. Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20 transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20 manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20 transmission system and use many TLRs. There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development= =20 of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and= =20 there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices. TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act= ed=20 as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the= =20 SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20 reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20 perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20 interconnection studies. In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20 plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida. Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th= is=20 summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than= =20 the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20 radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20 prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20 generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20 SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20 extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.) The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to= =20 discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S= E=20 (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence= =20 in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20 justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20 discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes= =20 that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20 transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns= =20 that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio= n=20 found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In= =20 addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff= =20 thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. = =20 Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20 jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20 information. The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac= k=20 of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20 addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20 capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20 interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied= =20 Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20 construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.= =20 Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20 self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory. ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20 standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20 direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati= on=20 are needed. The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais= es=20 the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv= e=20 operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20 Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20 criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d= o=20 not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs= =20 must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  = In=20 addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.= =20 However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives. *** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated= =20 weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the= =20 formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i= e,=20 treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20 tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio= n=20 of transparent and standardized information. Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20 ""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20 bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la= w=20 and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of= =20 deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20 incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20 addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list= s=20 a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the= =20 tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park= =20 power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20 development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential= . A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin= g=20 confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan= ge=20 information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available t= o=20 FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an= =20 established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not= =20 displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC= =20 web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine=20 competition.

The report is very encouraging=20 because it is comprehensive and recommends many of the changes and solution= s=20 that Enron has been advocating for years.  The report is also encouraging= =20 because it indicates a significant level of understanding of the northeast= =20 markets (and the problems in these markets) by the FERC people who worked o= n=20 this report.  Because this is only a brief summary, the entire report=20 (particularly sections 4 and 5) should be read in detail.  A copy of the=20 report is attached.

Attached are EPMI's responses to the FERC investigation of the bulk power markets in the East..  The ""summprob"" docs highlight examples of discriminatory practices and other problems with the OATT rules for trading and interconnection activities.  FERC staff asked for similar responses from 10 power marketers and plans to use the information in the aggregate in in its report to the Commission, due Nov. 1. 
On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.

Richard--Joe has some ideas about this and will get back with you (and submit the RCR). ""Tabors, Richard"" <tabors@tca-us.com> on 07/18/2000 06:05:36 PM 
Christi, Jim, et al This last exchange has been very helpful.  The question that we need some guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with the results.  There are at least two levels that we could look at effectively. 1.  Fairly quickly, a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of '98 when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest.  It would need to focus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today (along with the midwest) and also get a glimmer on (rumor picked up here) the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers.  The conclusion from '98 was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for both generation additions and for DSM investments (load response). Presumably this would carry forward to a 2000 study. 2.  A more careful look at the same areas described above but more focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers.  WE covered this only in a cursory fashion in '98.  Here we would need to do two things.  The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folks understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions (the lesson of 
Thanks, Jim--Dan Larcamp seemed to genuinely want to learn what the problems are and to educate his staff.  In that regard, we have offered to have some of his staff down to use some of Enron's tools.  He was specifically asking for the data below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps.  I didn't get a feeling that he would use the data to say that everything is fine.  In fact, we took him through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a ""seminar"" type activity for some of his senior staffers.  He is in the process of bringing on some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues, etc.  He was very familiar with the other problems on the grid. He also asked Kevin why Enron doesn't want LMP everywhere because with our staffing we can run over everyone else.  Kevin told him that then there is no market liquidity and we can't trade with ourselves.  As it is now, there are less than 10 big players due to the transmission risk.  We explained in detail what happens in the ""Into"" Markets and why it is so difficult to deal with transmission/physical risk.  Kevin said that even the big bank players, like Morgan Stanley, usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation so they do not have to take transmission risk.  Dan L., having come from gas, understood the liquidity issues and had a good discussion with Kevin.  (He sat down in Kevin's chair and looked at pricing on EOL.) Overall, it was a very positive meeting.  Kevin was impressed that Dan L. really understood the issues and acted like he wanted to do something, but needed help in educating his people. James D Steffes@EES 07/18/2000 04:00 PM 
Christi, etal -- I don't disagree with this analysis, but the drive for competitive generation is not simply related to the short term benefits (one year total energy bill versus next year total energy bill).  Competitive generation is also about risk transfer - regulated monopolies assign all new plant risk to customers, merchant generation assigns all new plant risk to shareholders. In addition, I hope that Larcamp won't take our data / analysis and try to argue that ""everything is fine"".  Clearly there are many undone / misdone public policy problems (e.g., native load exception, hourly transmission, etc.) left in the wholesale energy markets. Jim 
Richard T. -- Dan Larcamp of FERC was here today and asked for a comprehensive, real price study using data from last summer or the last two summers showing how much on a $kw basis that retail customers were affected by the price spikes (including how much they saved as a result of hopefully lower prices for the remainder of the year.)  He needs this to fight price caps.  How much would something like that cost (probably using some of the data you gathered last year.)?  How long would it take to create?  Thanks for your help.

This discusses Dynegy's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim Reliability measure for this summer.  Enron participated through EPSA (see my separate email) 
This is DYN's press release that refers to the FERC 's May 18 notice...? MANY THANKS KATHRYN 
On 6/2/00, Enron participated in EPSA's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Industry Reliability Efforts for the summer (attached).  On 5/17/00, FERC issued streamlined market based rates filings for industrials with on-site generation to sell into the grid, decreased approval requirements for utility deals with customers to interrupt load, more FERC hotline staff, and better updates of ATC.  In addition to FERC's proposals and requests for additional ideas, EPSA commented: Need robust competitive market to incentivize new generation Overall big requests--eliminate CBM, require independent ATC calculations, require independent Security Coordinators, and native load under same tariff Specific suggested fixes for this summer: (1) Require transmission providers to give written notice to FERC and post

On 5/17/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement (""IA"") and procedures subject to modification.  As I mentioned earlier, Entergy had adopted some of Enron's suggestion (in Enron's comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's loss of generation. All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not included with an interconnection request. Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale, as well as unbundled retail. Dismisses EPSA's call for a ""model"" and approves Entergy's pro forma interconnection agreement, subject to modification. Agreed with Enron that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence). Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to the IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions. Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate ""receipt"" of power without expansion, the new generator must pay costs of expansion. Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure ""interconnection"" and which are applicable when transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS). Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provide a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines). If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide. FERC will not initiate a ""generic"" proceeding at this time, but encourages all transmission providers to file procedures at FERC. Approves Entergy's credits for ""optional"" upgrades (required to transport power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work. Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subsequent studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator may be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  This is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS. Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating. Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, unless actual costs are $10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of studies). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency (or explain why that is inappropriate). Per Enron's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generator pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system. Entergy must submit a compliance tariff within 30 days.  Let me know if you 
TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source and sink filing. TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to the Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members ""predisposed to Enron's point of view.""  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy. Finally, TVA understands that ""Enron has prevented SERC"" from bringing the matter to NERC ADR. Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them on non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability until the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system (although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, I question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy also states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in case the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often does this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to check all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of timely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even analyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the tags now), Entergy says this is ""irrelevant"", but TLRs will be improved. Entergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that ""EPSA has not made a compelling argument that disclosure would harm liquidity.""  I think that the compelling arguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC approved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them and the tags don't require them. Entergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar information was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even so, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it inconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.) Finally, Entergy says that we can always put in ""anticipated"" source and sink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding that even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the power flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority. We are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the reliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material issue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least. 
I reviewed the ECAR filing.  ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an ECAR control area.  I generally think it is a good filing and of importance because it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a region has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, reliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).  The compensation between ECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the grid.  It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to participate. Inadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.  The NERC performance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short parties.  Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the long party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation price for power) + 10% penalty.  A $15/MW offset is used as the price of power repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC settlement procedures.  Price information is confidential. The ECAR dispute resolution procedure is applicable (binding ADR is voluntary).  Parties retain the right to go directly to FERC. Lloyd -- Are you OK with the specifics? I do not see any reason to protest this.  EPSA wants to use the $15 offset to show what may be reasonable for generator interconnects and I am discussing it with EPSA.  We should file a routine intervention (to obtain pleadings, orders, etc.)  Interventions are due Friday, May 5. Anyone disagree? Dave Mangskau@ENRON 04/20/2000 04:58 PM 
Christi: for your info if you plan to file in support of this ECAR action, as Enron's rep to ECAR  I discussed this internally and have been supportive of a final product that includes sanctions.  Enron is not a voting member nor were we given an opportunity to make changes to the final document that went out for ballot..........but it was similar to what was discussed in recent ECAR meetings and was finalized after ECAR reps met with FERC staff to meet FERC concerns. In addition, several weeks ago I presented the ECAR concept to the MAPP Executive Committee and after discussion MAPP passed a resolution of support for what ECAR was trying to accomplish to improve reliability.   In order to make a payment sanction for inadvertent really work, it should be approved by an entire interconnection.  ECAR officials are expecting approval very quickly so that sanctions are in place this summer to help support reliability. If Enron has changed its position, and we plan to oppose this action, lets discuss the ramifications including putting at risk the expected Executive Board action on May 1 to ratify CRC and OP & L recommendations to grant conditional certification of our two control areas in ECAR.                    thanx 
ECAR actually filed this at FERC already this week.  I am getting a copy of the filing.  We will have an opportunity to respond to it at FERC. 
** PRIVATE ** ECAR has filed a Section 205 request for Commission approval of an ""Inadvertent Settlement Tariff.""  The Tariff is intended to obligate each Party to make payment and to entitle each Party to receive compensation for Inadvertent Interchange from each other Party pursuant to ECAR's Inadvertent Settlement Procedure.  Parties to the settlement include Allegheny Power (Monongahela Power Company, The Potomac Edison Company, and West Penn Power Company), American Electric Power Co., Big Rivers Electric Corp., Cinergy Corp., Consumers Energy Co., The Dayton Power and Light Co., The Detroit Edison Co., Duquesne Light Co., East Kentucky Power Cooperative, Inc., FirstEnergy Corp., Hoosier Energy REC, Indianapolis Power and Light Co., LG&E Energy Corp., Northern Indiana Public Service Co., Ohio Valley Electric Corp., and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co. I will let you know when this gets noticed. 
Attached are the Figures and Tables for the Entergy Filing.  The first document should be all of the figures, and the rest should be each table in chronological order.  Andrea - 3ZLB01_.XLS - 3ZLC01_.XLS - 3ZLD01_.XLS - 3ZLF01_.XLS - 3ZLG01_.XLS - 3ZLX01_.XLS 
Below is the filing Enron made yesterday protesting Entergy Power Marketing's request to continue Market Based Rates.  Aquila and Dynegy also filed good protests.  I will separately email the charts that were attached to Enron's filing once I receive them later today. Also, Enron has filed (1) a protest of Entergy's request to require ""ultimate"" ""Valid"" source and sink (no sinks to generation only control areas) on all reservations and (2) comments on Entergy's proposed interconnection procedures and agreement (note: this was struck from FERC's agenda yesterday).  Let me know if you need copies of those two filings.

Update:  Based on Charles' great MRD presentation to Power Trading, the traders have some ideas about this.  I'll provide more info as soon as I get it from them. 
We need to determine whether Enron should work toward a bulletin board for MRD on Enron Online if OATI is already working on one.  If so, we would need to act quickly in order to compete with OATI for the summer (if we even want to do that since OATI had a very good tagging agent that Enron's tagging system really didn't compete with).  OATI already has the online auctioneer and is working on adding the MRD bids/offers. Also, if Enron Online wants Enron in the middle of every transaction as a sleeve (unlike a third party bid/offer platform), then we need to consider that since all MRD transactions are physical, this will add to the FERC costs that Enron will pay (at least until we get a final rule from FERC on costs). Additionally, the market may not take to MRD as well if Enron is the sleeve on all transactions. 
The OATI folks have been pretty cose to the NERC MRD activities. I have provided Nelson Mueller (OATI) with some thoughts on how to simplify the MRD set-up process.  (This involves the steps marketers must perform to figure out what generation and how much is needed for redispatch.) I knew that OATI has been responsive to facilitating the MRD procedures in the ETAG software and were interested in being a bulletin board for the bids and offers.  However, would OATI provide more than just a bulletin board?  I suspect they will not back up these products financially llike Enron OnLine could. Additionally, NSP's generator marketer has asked me if our traders would be interested in a ""contracted one-stop"" MRD service utilizing NSP's uncommitted reserve generation capability.  These units are on the ""good"" side of the Eau-Claire Arpin interface in MAPP/MAIN.  I will offer this in my presentation tomorrow to the traders. 
Charles--The OATI group was here today to teach EPMI about the OATI products that we are using.  OATI said that it is investigating whether to implement a generation bid/offer service platform on OATI.  Charles--Any thoughts? Note:  The fact that Enron has contracted with OATI for services is
