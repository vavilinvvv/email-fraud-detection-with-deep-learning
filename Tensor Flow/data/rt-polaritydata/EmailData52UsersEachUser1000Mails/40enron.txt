In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group. 
Ken Lay has a video message for you about the Chairman's Award on ""Up Front.""  Please go to ""Up Front"" at http://home.enron.com/upfront/ to access it.  An audio option and transcript are available for employees who cannot access the video. ""Up Front"" will feature open, honest and timely video messages from the Office of the Chairman and Enron management about what's going on around the company. 
This is a reminder of Enron's Email retention policy.  The Email retention policy provides as follows: Message Location - Maximum Retention Inbox - 30 days Sent Mail Folder - 30 days Trash/Deleted Items - Rollover from Inbox for one day Folders - All Email messages placed in folders will be destroyed after one calendar year. This includes public folders in Outlook. Furthermore, it is against policy to store Email outside of your Outlook Mailbox and/or your Public Folders.  Please do not copy Email onto floppy disks, zip disks, CDs or the network.  Such actions are prohibited and will not be supported by the IT Department. 
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively. If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network. Thank you. 
At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own. There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following: ?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. ""Professional Services"" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com. ?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/. ?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall. Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader. ?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible. ?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com. ?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S. ?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311. Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results. 
This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South. Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6. We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that: ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING. Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas. We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation. 
We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock. The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options. You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities. Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets. 
Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin. EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight. EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity. 
I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business. In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron. I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan. 
I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner. Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.

This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000. So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company. Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 29, 2001. *	Total Life to Date Transactions >  1,015,000 *	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $610 billion NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities. With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden. These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations. These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

For more information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to connections@newpower.com. Disclaimers: 
The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group. In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. Crude and Products group Mid-marketing Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett. Origination In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. Trading Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas. Shipping Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line. Weather The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline. Coal Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia. Enron Japan The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities. LNG LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities. Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region. Enron Freight Markets EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products. Global Risk Markets David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup. Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance. In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk. Financial Trading Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery. Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free. If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication. The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication. Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach. Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1. How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website. ?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. ?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/> o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon. o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. ?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking. ?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers. ?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday. For Counseling Assistance ?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. ?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need. This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Wow!  Enron employees and other Houstonians are showing such generosity! The response to the blood drive has been outstanding.  Employees from Continental Airlines and other surrounding corporations have come to our blood donation site to give.  Blood Center personnel have informed us that because of the overwhelming response donations are now being taken on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Blood Center is attempting to keep appointments on schedule.  However, we ask for your patience and understanding if there is a delay. It is indeed gratifying to witness your continued generosity to the community and beyond. 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread. The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal. Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative. This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay. A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility. The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team. eSource eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded ""Spending Wisely on Private Hubs"", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>. Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events. Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees. Enron Freight Markets EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.

Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days: ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262 thousand EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123 thousand If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox. We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com. We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings. We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com. U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled. 
11, 2001 
In light of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001, our concern is to support our employees through this difficult time.  We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of a resource available to you, Enron's Employee Assistance Program.  This service is available to you or any member of your immediate family to provide counseling services.  To talk to a counselor, simply call (713) 853-6057 during business hours in Houston or the 24 hour service line at (800) 345-1391.  If you are outside the US, please contact your Human Resources Representative for further details.  Please also be aware of any colleagues who may require assistance during this time and may not be able to seek help for themselves.

Dear Enron Employees: I'm sorry to report that a third Enron employee has died in the hospital as a result of injuries from yesterday's explosion and fire at Teesside Power Station.  To lose another employee is a devastating blow to all of us.  A fourth employee remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.  Please keep these employees and their families in your thoughts and prayers.  We will release their names as soon as all family members and relatives have been notified. 
Earlier this evening, the police were able to confirm to Enron that all of our employees who tragically died or were injured as a result of yesterday's explosion have now been identified.  This means we are now in a position to give you some information about the members of staff: Graeme White Graeme, 37, is in a stable condition at Middlesbrough General Hospital.  He has worked as an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station since October 1999.  Graeme lives in Billingham and is separated with two children. Paul Surtees Paul was Engineering & Maintenance Manager at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in 1992.   He was divorced with a young daughter and lived in Hawthorn, County Durham.  Paul died in Middlesbrough General Hospital earlier today.  He was 40. Andrew Sherwood Andrew was an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in March 1999.  He lived with his partner in Hartlepool.  Andrew died at the scene yesterday. He was 36. Darren Higgins Darren was also an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in October 1997.  He was unmarried and lived in Normanby near Middlesbrough.  Darren died at the scene yesterday.  He was 28 and leaves a young son living in Poland. We are continuing to offer as much support as possible to the families of these employees, as well as their friends and colleagues at the plant and associated sites across Enron. We understand that the last twenty-four hours have been extremely traumatic for everyone concerned. We appreciate there are many questions that remain unanswered, but for the moment our thoughts and prayers are with those we have lost and their families and friends. We will communicate more information about the incident as it becomes available.

From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market. To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer. Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.

With the formation of the Management Committee we are discontinuing the Enron Executive Committee.  Instead of weekly Executive Committee meetings with a subset of Enron's Managing Directors, we will hold quarterly meetings which will include all of Enron's Managing Directors.  These meetings will allow a wider dissemination of information and views and will enable more substantive discussions about the opportunities and challenges we face. 
Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") are exposed to market, cre= dit, operational and liquidity/funding risks in the normal course of its bu= siness activities.  The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk = Management Policy (the ""Policy"") on August 14, 2001.  This Policy establish= es a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluat= ed, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated= and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market= risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk= .  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transacti= ons via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes,= and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and= the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of vari= ous risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the= roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management= framework. =20 Management and employees are responsible for complying with the risk manage= ment policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at http://= home.enron.com/resources.  Following an initial transiton period, various i= ndividuals within the key functions participating in the Company's risk man= agement framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an exa= mple of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H. If you have any questions, please contact Cassandra Schultz, cassandra.schu= ltz@enron.com, 713-853-0429 who will put you in touch with the appropriate = Risk Assessment & Control representative.

The Emission group is developing int= o a business that entails Enron's core skill sets.  The Emission group is d= eveloping origination, mid-marketing, and finance as well as continuing to = focus on the trading side of the business.     =20 On January 1st, 2002, the Houston-Galveston Mass Emission Cap & Trade Progr= am begins in our backyard.  This program is designed to reduce the emission= s in the Houston-Galveston area by 90% by the year 2007.   The program incl= udes Harris county and the surrounding seven adjacent counties.  Enron has = emerged early as the dominant player in this cap and trade program.  Enron = has already become an active player by making the initial trades in NOx DER= Cs (Discrete Emission Reduction Credit) market.  Enron has almost made nume= rous trades in the NOx ERC market.      =20 Trevor Woods and Michael Taylor have recently joined the Emissions Trading = Group.  The group, which includes trader John Massey, looks to become a pri= ncipal player in many regional and national emission cap and trade programs= , including San Joaquin County and NOx SIP CALL. =20 Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS) ACCRO Phase III - IV =20 We are pleased to announce that final acceptance has been received by our c= lient Accroven SLR (50%Enron) from PDVSA-Gas (Venezuela's National Gas Comp= any) for the facilities built and performance tested by our Accro Project T= eam. Thus completing the final major milestone on what must be considered t= o be one of EEOS's most successful projects.=20 Although contracted as one $320MM project, the work had to be managed as fo= ur distinct jobs. The prime site, at Jose, consists of a grassroots 50,000 = bpd NGL's Fractionation Plant plus Offsite Refrigerated Storage; the latter= facilities, being contained entirely within PDVSA's existing live plant, h= ad to be built entirely under PDVSA's Hot-work Permitting system.  In addit= ion, the site was under constant threat of disruptive action by very vocal = and active Unionized workers. Thanks to the negotiating skills of our Site = Manager, Tony Burke, they were shut-down only 25% as much as three adjacent= major projects .The secondary sites, at Santa Barbara and San Joaquin, con= tained two grassroots 400MMSCFD Propane Extraction Plants. Not only did the= ir remoteness cause significant logistical problems for equipment delivery,= but also both had significant labour relations problems peculiar to their = own locations. San Joaquin suffered many days of Force Majeure delay caused= by the disruptive action by several local community groups protesting lack= of work. Despite all the impediments of the local labour, logistics, and the usual c= ustoms clearance issues, the construction was essentially finished on sched= ule. Commissioning and start-up brought new challenges with erratic feedstock qu= alities testing both the design and the expertise of our start-up crews. It= is a tribute to both, that all performance tests were passed within 48 hou= rs of receiving a reasonably stable supply and the design flow rates, and t= hat the plants have remained online since, or available, with minimal hiccu= ps, generating significant income for our client. Congratulations Accro Project Team! Bob Meckna, Tony Burke, Andy Trevino, Dennis Zitterkopf, Bill Johnson and t= he rest of the team at site, in Houston, and from Teesside for achieving a = remarkable success for which all participants can be proud; not only has th= e client gotten plants that exceed performance, the team was able to bring = home double the budgeted profit. IN THE NEWS Enron All-Employee Meeting: At the All-Employee Meeting on August 16, Ken L= ay, Enron president and CEO, provided employees with a general overview of = Enron's performance to date and his expectations for the remainder of the y= ear.

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business. In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron. I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become ""The World's Leading Company,"" and what that means to me. Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, ""Lay It on the Line"" for me by completing the attached survey.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets Enron Global Risk Markets (GRM) is pleased to announce the financial close of Project Ranch. This transaction involved an insurance wrap on a Volumetric Production Payment (VPP) consummated by Enron Capital Resources in February 2001. As part of this deal, Enron was able to successfully syndicate upstream reserve and operations risk to the insurance markets. The convergence of Insurance and Capital Markets is still a novel concept in the world of finance and Enron is proud to be one of the first companies to be involved in a transaction of this kind. Special mention should be made of the GRM deal team (Doug Jones, Rafi Khan, Tony Wolfe, Sebastien Saubier, Brian Cohen) and of the Global Finance team (Tim Proffitt, Nora Dobin, Chris Herron, Ying Liu) for their very hard work and dedication to the deal. Enron Engineering and Operational Services Since May, EEOS has been providing operational support at the Cuiaba, Brazil facility, a 450 MW combined cycle plant.  Our team members have consisted of John Krupski and Yaser Tobeh from the Houston office, Don Schmidt from New Albany, Derrick Skerritt and Howard Peel from our Teeside operations in the UK. John, Yaser, Don, Derrick and Howard have been providing operational and maintenance support at the project, as well as providing mentor/coaching support for the staff. They have been instrumental in developing and implementing a team building approach at the facility and trying to instill a sense of ownership with the facility.  Additionally, they have been working closely with Simmens and our start-up team ensuring that the plant will be commissioned successfully on natural gas.  Gas commissioning started on August 5th, and to date we have had a successful run with one unit.  Thus the momentum has been building very quickly for the local staff to assume full operations sometime within the next 30 days.  EEOS will keep a small crew involved over the next six months, keeping a watchful eye on operations to make sure that things keep rolling along smoothly. Enron Industrial Markets The Forest Products Origination Group headed by Rob Saltiel develops transactions for forest products companies that can benefit from EIM's risk management and structured finance capabilities.  The goal is to advance Enron's desired physical and financial commodity positions in newsprint, pulp, recycled papers, linerboard and/or lumber while bringing commodity and capital benefits to customers. Given the difficulties currently facing the industry, many companies are particularly interested in managing their earnings and balance sheets more tightly.  As a result, the originators are gaining access to industry CEOs and CFOs to develop their deal concepts.   Current deals under development include asset monetizations, supply/inventory outsourcing, pre-payments for physical supplies, and sculpted swaps. IN THE NEWS HOUSTON (AP) - After a shakeup of its upper management ranks earlier this month, energy giant Enron Corp. solidified its leadership Tuesday by promoting two longtime executives. Greg Whalley was named president and chief operating officer while Mark Frevert was elevated to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board and chief executive, in the Office of the Chairman. ""Greg and Mark bring a wealth of talent and experience to the Office of the Chairman,"" Lay said. ""In addition to having led Enron Wholesale Services, they have a collective 26 years of extensive experience across Enron's businesses and both played key roles in increasing our deliveries of energy and other commodities in North America and Europe.""

Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years.  Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology. On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods. We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS West Power On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.  The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.   The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.  The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.  This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.  Congratulations to everyone who made it a success. Enron Freight Markets Enron Freight Markets closed its first firm sale of transportation with Penske Logistics. Penske is under contract for the operation and U.S. distribution of Whirlpool appliances.  EFM will provide truckload capacity for Penske to serve Whirlpool.  The first lane that EFM will begin handling is from the southern California distribution center in Ontario, California to various northern California destinations.

Enron Federal Credit Union E-Survey Response We recently asked you to participate in the EFCU 2001 E-Survey.  More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect. We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings: 2001	2000 Friendliness		88%	84% Courtesy		89%	84% Knowledge/Training	86%	80% Range of Services	87%	82% Saving Interest Rates	66%	60% Loan Interest Rates	65%	58% Quality of Service	88%	84% Communications	84%	79% Web Portal		72%	N/A Service Wait Time	79%	68% Of course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve: ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees: -  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions. -  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations). -  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations). -  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month. Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible. Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible. Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible. We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions: -  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day. -  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m. -  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up. -  Sign up for QuickLink - Internet Account Access.  QuickLink is free and allows you to verify cleared checks and posted deposits, transfer funds and more, all from the convenience of your computer.  Sign up at enronfcu.com. -  Sign up for QuickTeller - Automated Phone System.  QuickTeller is also a free service that allows you to perform all of the same functions as QuickLink, but by telephone.  Go to enronfcu.com to sign up. 
It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility. Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars. Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability. EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new ""Morning Briefing"" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days: ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000 EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox. We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September. If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. IN THE NEWS Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8 Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13. California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand. ``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented: - Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, - Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry - All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections. The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets. 
Effective, July 1, 2001, a number of measures and recommendations were implemented to reduce costs associated with travel, entertainment and professional services throughout Enron.  As ETS employees, it is our responsibility to follow the Enron-wide cost-savings guidelines below: Travel and Business Expenses ?	Air Travel - Reducing air transportation costs is Enron's top priority.  Please take advantage of Enron's negotiated discounted airline fares by using ClickTrip, the Enron-managed online travel booking service, located at <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>.  Although use of Travel Agency in the Park (""TAP"") or the Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS)-approved preferred travel agency for your location are still available, ClickTrip is the tool we should all use. ClickTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination (excluding proprietary carriers) and assists employees in making the most cost-effective travel decisions by providing the most current information.  In addition to bringing an estimated savings of 20%, ClickTrip is easy to use and is accessible 24 hours a day from any internet-enabled personal computer.  After-hours telephone support is also available. When making travel reservations, please purchase non-refundable coach tickets when flying in the U.S., for these tickets can cost up to 65% less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed, if necessary, for a $100 fee. ?	Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has negotiated preferred rates at a number of worldwide hotel chains, as well as with National and Alamo car rental companies.  For more detailed information, please visit <http://travel.enron.com>. ?	On-line Expense Reporting - All requests for reimbursement of business-related expenses should be made through XMS, the new on-line expense account reporting tool.  Please access XMS at <http://xms.enron.com>. ?	Off-site Meetings - To schedule off-site meetings and events for more than 10 people, please contact Tracy Ramsey, GSS Director, Travel and Transportation Services Portfolio Team at (713) 646-8311. For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 646-8311. Professional Services To better leverage Enron's purchasing power, all new professional service expenditure arrangements including legal, financial, accounting, engineering, information technology and others, and those due for renewal, must be negotiated through, or in consultation with, GSS.  Contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by both GSS and ETS. Prior to engaging GSS, please submit all service requisition forms to Rod Hayslett, Danny McCarty, Phil Lowry or me for business unit approval. To comply with the professional service procedure, a Professional Services Requisition form must be completed.  This requisition can be accessed on-line at <http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/servicesprojectrequestform.xls>, or by contacting Ron L. Smith, GSS Director, Administrative and Indirect Services Portfolio Team at (713) 345-6329. Additional information about Enron's cost-saving initiative will be on ETV, in eBiz and Enron Business, as well as in information booths in the Enron Building. As we all work together to reduce costs across Enron, please forward additional cost-saving ideas to <recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com>. If you have additional questions, please contact Derryl Cleaveland, GSS Senior Director of Operations, at (713) 646-7024. Stan 
11, 2001 
In light of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001, our concern is to support our employees through this difficult time.  We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of a resource available to you, Enron's Employee Assistance Program.  This service is available to you or any member of your immediate family to provide counseling services.  To talk to a counselor, simply call (713) 853-6057 during business hours in Houston or the 24 hour service line at (800) 345-1391.  If you are outside the US, please contact your Human Resources Representative for further details.  Please also be aware of any colleagues who may require assistance during this time and may not be able to seek help for themselves. 
As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com. We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings. We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com. U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled. 
Important Instructions for Sending in Expense Reports: ?	Prepare your expense report. ?	Once completed, click on the print button at the top. ?	A box requesting you to select the appropriate type of report will be displayed.  Select either Receipt Report or Detail Report based on the following specifications: 1.	Receipt Report - This report must be printed and sent to accounting. This report has a bar code on it that is needed for the accounting department to scan in your report. It also tells you which receipts must be sent in with the receipt report. 2.	Detail Report - Do not send this report to accounting (it has no bar code).  This report is more appropriate for the traveler or the person that prepares the report in case they would like to keep a paper copy. ?	Once you have printed the receipt report and attached the receipts, you must send all expense reports in the white A/P envelope with the open slot at the right hand corner (the bar code must be seen through this slot). 
eProcurement Today marks the launch of the iBuyit eProcurement tool within Enron Transportation Services.  While many employees are using eProcurement through the B2B procurement tool, starting today, employees throughout ETS should utilize the iBuyit eProcurement tool to purchase O&M expense materials, office supplies, IT hardware and both fleet and capital work order material. Using iBuyit is a milestone in the Enron-wide cost saving effort.  This new tool will enable us to monitor and analyze our expenses and enhance our value with preferred suppliers, as well as help us control costs more effectively. The iBuyit eProcurement tool also has the potential for unlimited growth when partnered with the ETS Procurement organization, the GSS organization and good business sense. As you use iBuyit, please provide Morris Brassfield and the iBuyit team feedback to ensure that the eProcurement tool becomes and remains a valuable and integral part of our purchasing activities. Please visit the iBuyit portal to logon to iBuyit eProcurement to access training information and materials and learn more about Enron's business-wide cost savings opportunities: <http://ibuyit.enron.com>.  To logon enter your User ID (P number) and Password (initial password is ENRON1). If assistance is needed, please contact your trainer or call the ISC Customer Care line at 713.345.4727. For general information about iBuyit or the eProcurement upgrade, please send your questions via e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>. Thanks, in advance, for using the iBuyit eProcurement tool to minimize costs. Stan 
Enron Transportation Services iBuyit Spend and Approval Guidelines Effective July 1, 2001 It is important that our business unit has a consistent, documented approach to spending to maximize our return on every dollar spent.  Enron Transportation Services will follow the spend and approval guidelines for the iBuyit eProcurement application.  Please review these new guidelines carefully and modify your purchase activities accordingly. Many of you currently use iBuyit eProcurement to purchase IT hardware, and others began to use the tool on July 2, 2001, to purchase office supplies.  iBuyit eProcurement will automatically route purchase requests for approval based on our spend/approval guidelines.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable. Enron Freight Markets During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks. EnronOnline On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives. Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001 ?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million ?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion IN THE NEWS Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer. Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments. We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program. Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments. We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program. Find Out how to Join The Downtown Club May 29 & 30!

Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program. This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000. So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company. Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication. The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication. Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach. Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed. What This Change Means To You Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area. To re-program an Auto-Dial button: ?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys ?         Press the Program button on your soft keys ?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program ?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below) ?

From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market. To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer. Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.

At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become ""The World's Leading Company,"" and what that means to me. Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, ""Lay It on the Line"" for me by completing the attached survey. 
Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years.  Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology. On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods. We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1. How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website. ?

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin. EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight. EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity. 
Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our em= ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for= Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w= e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20 ?During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc= hange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,= which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be= tter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap= pears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan= ge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug. ?Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience= d database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou= tlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan= ge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv= er.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --= we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit= h the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus= iness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W= ednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov= e users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac= ted users could not access their e-mail. ?During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger= ous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus= es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail = is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop= s.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning= updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. = The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance= of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus = product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w= e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co= mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t= ime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that = will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th= e performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to = get better. There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las= t few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the= overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and= meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS West Power On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.  The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.   The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.  The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.  This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.  Congratulations to everyone who made it a success.

Penske is under contract for the operation and U.S. distribution of Whirlpool appliances.  EFM will provide truckload capacity for Penske to serve Whirlpool.

Enron Federal Credit Union E-Survey Response We recently asked you to participate in the EFCU 2001 E-Survey.  More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect. We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings: 2001	2000 Friendliness		88%	84% Courtesy		89%	84% Knowledge/Training	86%	80% Range of Services	87%	82% Saving Interest Rates	66%	60% Loan Interest Rates	65%	58% Quality of Service	88%	84% Communications	84%	79% Web Portal		72%	N/A Service Wait Time	79%	68% Of course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve: ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees: -  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions. -  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations). -  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations). -  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month. Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible. Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible. Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible. We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions: -  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day. -  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m. -  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up. -  Sign up for QuickLink - Internet Account Access.  QuickLink is free and allows you to verify cleared checks and posted deposits, transfer funds and more, all from the convenience of your computer.  Sign up at enronfcu.com. -  Sign up for QuickTeller - Automated Phone System.  QuickTeller is also a free service that allows you to perform all of the same functions as QuickLink, but by telephone.  Go to enronfcu.com to sign up. 
It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it. If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer. Thank you very much for your support.

In light of the tragic events in New York City and Washington, DC, there is a national call for blood donations.  Enron is taking two actions: 1.	The City of Houston is sponsoring a city-wide blood drive at the George R. Brown Convention Center today.  For your convenience, Enron is providing transportation to and from the Convention Center from 9am-3pm.  Transportation will be leaving from the Enron Building every half hour.  We have been informed that there is a 3 - 4 hour wait. 2.	Enron's regularly scheduled blood drive is being held on Thursday, September 13, from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m.  Two mobile units from the M. D. Anderson Blood Center will be parked outside the Enron Building on Andrews Street to accommodate donors.  Call the Enron Health Center at ext. 3-6100 to schedule an appointment.  Information regarding Enron's blood drive program and eligibility criteria is location on the Wellness webpage http://hrweb.enron.com/wellness/healthService/bloodDrive.asp 
Due to the overwhelming response from Enron employees and contractors, today's blood drive appointments are completely full, and there are a large number of you who still wish to donate blood.  We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured.  For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext. 3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building.  We recognize and are grateful to the many of you who are wanting to give blood today, but ask that you be patient and understand our inability to accept walk-in donations at this time. 
From Enron Corp Business Controls Operations in Enron's Crisis Management Center will cease at the close of business in Houston on September 12.  All inquiries or information pertaining to the events of the last two days should now be directed to Enron Corp Business Controls at 713.345.2804.  In the event immediate assistance is required after hours, the Business Controls telephone number will be answered by the 24x7 security desk which can have a representative from Business Controls return your call immediately.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1. How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website. ?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. ?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/> o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon. o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. ?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking. ?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers. ?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday. For Counseling Assistance ?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. ?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need. This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Wow!  Enron employees and other Houstonians are showing such generosity! The response to the blood drive has been outstanding.  Employees from Continental Airlines and other surrounding corporations have come to our blood donation site to give.  Blood Center personnel have informed us that because of the overwhelming response donations are now being taken on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Blood Center is attempting to keep appointments on schedule.  However, we ask for your patience and understanding if there is a delay. It is indeed gratifying to witness your continued generosity to the community and beyond. 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread. The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal. Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative. This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay. A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility. The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team. eSource eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded ""Spending Wisely on Private Hubs"", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>. Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events. Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees. Enron Freight Markets EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business. In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron. I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our em= ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for= Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w= e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20 ?During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc= hange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,= which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be= tter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap= pears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan= ge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug. ?Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience= d database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou= tlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan= ge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv= er.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --= we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit= h the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus= iness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W= ednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov= e users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac= ted users could not access their e-mail. ?During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger= ous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus= es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail = is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop= s.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning= updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. = The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance= of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus = product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w= e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co= mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t= ime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that = will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th= e performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to = get better. There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las= t few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the= overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and= meet Enron's business needs and expectations. 
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively. If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network. Thank you.

Everyone, Once again, there are a number of new viruses that have been released on the internet that are causing us to do frequent updates to our virus protection software. We have an automated process to update our workstations with the latest virus protection updates.   However, there may be some machines that didn't get the update.  In order to prevent these viruses from infecting your machine, please assist by doing one of the following tasks. 1.  Logout of the network and log back in or 2.  Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button.  This will pop up a screen where you will have to click the ""Next"" button and then a ""Finish"" button.   (If you are an EES user, you will only be able to use option #1 as you use a different virus protection product.) The proper version of the update pattern you need is:   (9/24/2001, version 30924p) If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to your Resolution Center. 
Everyone, In an effort to protect our computing systems from viruses and other potential threats, we have disabled the ability to get to external e-mail sites (AOL, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) while you are using an Enron computer connected to our network. If you are using a particular external e-mail site for valid business reasons and this action we have taken has impacted your business, you can contact your Resolution Center for assistance.  Each case will be analyzed for validity and exceptions granted based on business related needs. Thank you for your understanding that protecting our revenue generating systems is our highest priority. 
At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become ""The World's Leading Company,"" and what that means to me. Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, ""Lay It on the Line"" for me by completing the attached survey.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets Enron Global Risk Markets (GRM) is pleased to announce the financial close of Project Ranch. This transaction involved an insurance wrap on a Volumetric Production Payment (VPP) consummated by Enron Capital Resources in February 2001. As part of this deal, Enron was able to successfully syndicate upstream reserve and operations risk to the insurance markets. The convergence of Insurance and Capital Markets is still a novel concept in the world of finance and Enron is proud to be one of the first companies to be involved in a transaction of this kind. Special mention should be made of the GRM deal team (Doug Jones, Rafi Khan, Tony Wolfe, Sebastien Saubier, Brian Cohen) and of the Global Finance team (Tim Proffitt, Nora Dobin, Chris Herron, Ying Liu) for their very hard work and dedication to the deal. Enron Engineering and Operational Services Since May, EEOS has been providing operational support at the Cuiaba, Brazil facility, a 450 MW combined cycle plant.  Our team members have consisted of John Krupski and Yaser Tobeh from the Houston office, Don Schmidt from New Albany, Derrick Skerritt and Howard Peel from our Teeside operations in the UK. John, Yaser, Don, Derrick and Howard have been providing operational and maintenance support at the project, as well as providing mentor/coaching support for the staff. They have been instrumental in developing and implementing a team building approach at the facility and trying to instill a sense of ownership with the facility.  Additionally, they have been working closely with Simmens and our start-up team ensuring that the plant will be commissioned successfully on natural gas.  Gas commissioning started on August 5th, and to date we have had a successful run with one unit.  Thus the momentum has been building very quickly for the local staff to assume full operations sometime within the next 30 days.  EEOS will keep a small crew involved over the next six months, keeping a watchful eye on operations to make sure that things keep rolling along smoothly. Enron Industrial Markets The Forest Products Origination Group headed by Rob Saltiel develops transactions for forest products companies that can benefit from EIM's risk management and structured finance capabilities.  The goal is to advance Enron's desired physical and financial commodity positions in newsprint, pulp, recycled papers, linerboard and/or lumber while bringing commodity and capital benefits to customers. Given the difficulties currently facing the industry, many companies are particularly interested in managing their earnings and balance sheets more tightly.  As a result, the originators are gaining access to industry CEOs and CFOs to develop their deal concepts.   Current deals under development include asset monetizations, supply/inventory outsourcing, pre-payments for physical supplies, and sculpted swaps. IN THE NEWS HOUSTON (AP) - After a shakeup of its upper management ranks earlier this month, energy giant Enron Corp. solidified its leadership Tuesday by promoting two longtime executives. Greg Whalley was named president and chief operating officer while Mark Frevert was elevated to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board and chief executive, in the Office of the Chairman. ""Greg and Mark bring a wealth of talent and experience to the Office of the Chairman,"" Lay said.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication. The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication. Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach. Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel. The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules. We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website. 
Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity! This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo. The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community. 
I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel. Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant. Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties. 
Ken Lay has a special video message for you about the Sept. 11 tragedy.  Please go to ""Up Front"" at <http://home.enron.com/upfront/> to access it.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility. Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars. Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability. EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new ""Morning Briefing"" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days: ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000 EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox. We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September. If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. IN THE NEWS Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8 Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13. California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand. ``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented: - Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, - Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry - All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections. The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets. 
In preparation for the new Travel Center that will coincide with the opening of Enron Center South,  Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) will be consolidating its two Enron locations. Effective Friday, September 28, 2001 the 3 Allen Center office will be closing. If you currently pick up tickets and/or e-ticket receipts in 3 Allen Center, Suite 150, beginning on October 1, 2001 please pick up your tickets at the TAP location on the third floor in the Enron Building. Sam Zeidan and David Lewis will still be available for all of your visa and passport needs. Leslie Speck will also continue to serve as the Customer Service Manager for Enron. Their new telephone numbers are as follows. Sam Zeidan and Leslie Speck - 713-860-1100 David Lewis - 713-853-4801 
This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South. Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6. We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that: ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING. Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas. We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years.  Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology. On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods. We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business. In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron. I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan. 
We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes: Enron Global Assets and Services In order to increase senior management focus on our international businesse= s, we are creating a new business unit, Enron Global Assets and Services (E= GAS).  EGAS will be led by Kevin Hannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Jim H= ughes, Chief Operating Officer.  Kevin will report to the Enron Corp. Offic= e of the Chairman.  With the exception of the Wessex Water Company (which w= ill remain in the Enron Transportation Services organization) and Enron Ind= ia (discussed below), EGAS will include all of the assets and activities of= the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS wi= ll include Enron's assets and merchant activities in South America.  In ord= er to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant bu= siness, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities= .  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merc= hant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services = Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Execut= ive Officer of Enron Americas. Enron India Enron's significant interests in India are commanding increased attention f= rom Enron's senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McD= onald will focus exclusively on Enron's business in India, as Chief Executi= ve Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chair= man. Enron Broadband Services With Kevin's departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also mak= ing a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be Pr= esident and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano = and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within = their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Offic= er of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of t= he Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network= Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Offic= e of the Chairman. Enron Principal Investments In order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities relat= ed to Enron's core businesses, we are combining the existing investment gro= ups in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Grou= p into a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investm= ents will work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and mana= ge equity investments that leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledg= e.  These investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-= outs, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new b= usiness unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will r= eport to an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and= Greg Whalley.=20 Enron Corporate Development In order to improve coordination of Enron's corporate development activitie= s, we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice = President and Chief Financial Officer.  Jeff Donahue, Managing Director of = Corporate Development for EBS will now head Corporate Development across En= ron.  Corporate Development leaders in the business units will have a dual = reporting relationship to their business units and to Jeff. One of Enron's most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets or = businesses that are no longer core operations.  Mark Metts, Executive Vice = President of Enron Corp., will head up a new Special Projects group to spec= ifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging transact= ions. =20 Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new resp= 
At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own. There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following: ?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. ""Professional Services"" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com. ?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/. ?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall. Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader. ?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible. ?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com. ?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S. ?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311. Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Treatment 
Management and employees both have roles in meeting Enron's commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and Harassment Prevention.  To achieve Enron's vision, we need to recruit, select, retain, and manage the most talented people effectively.  We expect all employees to demonstrate Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.  Our efforts to achieve equal employment, and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive, inventive, and competitive as possible in a world of changes. Enron is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer.  In choosing to do business with federal, state, and city government agencies, Enron implements affirmative action plans (AAP) to recruit, retain, and promote women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and covered veterans.  Our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices, individual qualifications and merit.  Employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace, including recruitment, applicant screening, hiring, training, assignments, compensation, benefits, job performance evaluation, disciplinary action, separation, and the like.  There is no place at Enron for management practices that include bias, favoritism, discrimination, harassment, or conduct that otherwise violates the law or Company policy. Enron's Harassment Prevention Policy was developed to prevent harassment and help all employees to maintain a productive and mutually rewarding work relationship.  Harassment of any type, including sexual harassment, is contrary to our policy and preventable with education and respectful personal behavior.  We want all employees to know what harassment is, how to prevent it and how to report it.  Our policy outlines these unacceptable behaviors and helps employees better understand work-related expectations and steps.  Every employee at Enron is expected to prevent harassment and report it if it happens. Enron's Fair Treatment Policy was developed to provide and maintain a work environment in which all employees are treated equitably.  Our goal is to resolve employment disputes promptly, informally and (where possible) at the lowest level.  Employees who believe they are treated unfairly are encouraged to discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor.  When a concern of unfair, unlawful or unsafe treatment is raised, it will be investigated thoroughly and promptly.  An effective resolution will be reached based on all the information.  The Company will take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality, but must act on assertions indicating that a violation of policy or law has occurred. Each of these policies is available for review at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Please familiarize yourself with these policies.  Enron expects and encourages every worker to report workplace issues of concern.  If you need to speak with anyone someone regarding these policies or if an incident occurs that concerns you, please talk with your supervisor, contact your Human Resources representative, or call Enron's Office of Labor and Employment Relations Department at 713-853-7573.  Management is expected to ensure retaliation does not occur.  In addition, Cindy Olson, as  is Enron's EEO officer.  As and  Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations, Cindy has the responsibility, authority, and full support of Enron to ensure that all employees can avail themselves of our policies. Your support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment.  In turn, such personal and organizational success adds to Enron's business success. 
INTEROFFICE MEMO 
It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results. 
In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group. 
I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner. Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1. How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.

If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website. ?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. ?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.

We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday. For Counseling Assistance ?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. ?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need. This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock. The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options. You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable Processing Centers Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement and payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central.  But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution. In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system. Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information: *  Company Number or Legal Entity Name *  Contact Name *  Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number *  New P.O. Box  (See Below) What is an EID? An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders? Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders. Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders? No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do. What if I do not know my EID? All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  You can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose ""Personal Information"" to pull up your personal profile.  On the left side of the ""Personal Information"" screen select ""Other"" and you will see your: *  PID (SAP ID) *  GIS ID *  EID What is our new mailing address (PO Box)? Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address: PO Box 4734 Houston, TX  77210-4734 What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me? HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope ""Attention Enron Accounts Payable,"" and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enron mail center. FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston.  Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address: 3724 Dacoma Houston, TX  77092 ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE Note:  ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally.

For Password Renewals Only IT Security & Controls - Password Security Notice Passwords The key to maintaining information and system security is the use of well-selected and guarded passwords.  Because your password is our first line of defense, stronger password selection criteria will soon be implemented for all employees. Password Policy Passwords? 1.	must be at least of eight characters in length. 2.	must not contain names, userids, common English dictionary words, and begin or end with a number. 3.	must contain alphanumeric characters and contain at least one special character. No more than fifty percent of the overall password can be in English. 4.	must not be reused or cyclical. 5.	must be changed every 60 days. 6.	must not be publicly displayed. 7.	must not be shared with other users. Choosing a good password comes down to two things.  First, avoid common everyday words a potential hacker's software will be looking for.  Second, keep your password  simple enough that you can remember it without having to write it down. Please keep in mind that the Enron Code of Ethics holds employees responsible for password security.  IT Security & Controls conducts periodic audits to ensure compliance with company policy. http://itc.corp.enron.com/data/policiesandprocedures/ITPasswordScreenSaver/

Time in eHRonline 
The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has received recommendations from you, our eHRonline users, on ways we might improve the time entry process as it relates to holiday pay.  Based upon these suggestions, the ISC is implementing a new time entry process to record holiday time, which is effective immediately, beginning with the February 16-28, 2001, time-entry period. Holiday pay for all eligible employees must be entered as ""Company Observed Holiday"", and the recent company-observed holiday of President's Day (Monday, February 19, 2001) must be coded ""Company Observed Holiday"".  However, if you're an employee who works a 12-hour shift schedule, there are no changes to your time entry process for Holiday pay.  Please continue to record your holiday time in the usual manner. If you're a salaried, non-exempt employee and you work a holiday, you must enter ""Company Observed Holiday"" for that holiday and enter ""Regular Work Time"" for all hours worked on the holiday to ensure proper payment of overtime for the day. Discretionary holiday time has been limited to eight (8) hours for all eligible employees, per the Enron Policy on Work Hours/Holidays/Vacation (<http://hrweb.enron.com/policyandprocedure/docs/12-hours.pdf>).   eHRonline will not allow you to record more than eight (8) hours per calendar year under the ""Discretionary Holiday"" time-entry code. Detailed instructions on coding holiday time are available within SAP eHRonline Process Bulletin HR -01-04, which can be accesed through the following link:  http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=145. If you have questions regarding this new eHRonline functionality, please contact the ISC Call Center at (713) 345-4SAP (4727).  Questions about the Enron Policy on Work Hours/Holidays/Vacation should be directed to your Human Resources representative. 
eProcurement The purpose of this e-mail is to explain a new feature of the eProcurement system.  Also, check out answers to some of the most commonly asked eProcurement questions below. New Feature! Many of you have asked, ""Why can't eProcurement prompt me to enter the delivery address?""  Effective today, a delivery address is required before you are able to shop.  Click on the link to learn the ins and outs of inputting delivery address information. http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/deliveryaddressscreen.ppt Frequently Asked Questions Help!  Where's my completed shopping cart? If you do not see your shopping cart in Check Status, click the Completed Items check box. Who's my approver? There are two types of approvers: monetary and technical. * Monetary approvers are determined by EWS-defined spend and approval limits and the reporting structure of EWS.  eProcurement does not automatically route to cost center owners. * IT purchase requests require technical purchasing review by IT Procurement prior to processing.  Hence, you are able to see the buyers' names in the approval routing (Donna Ruff, Andrew Sikes, and other approver), in addition to the monetary approver's name, if necessary. Need Training? * Check out on-line eProcurement courses at no charge: <http://iscedcenter.enron.com> * Visit the ISC Document Library for Quick Reference Cards and other helpful training materials: <http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp> Questions? * For help using eProcurement, contact Integrated Solutions Center Customer Care at 713-345-4727. * For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>.

eProcurement As the number of shopping carts for IT hardware and office supplies increases, we continue to learn tips to share.  Going forward, I will be your Enron Wholesale Services point of contact for questions and comments concerning eProcurement.  These answers, as well as helpful tips, will be passed on to you through updates similar to the one below.  This update focuses on delivery addresses and the eProcurement Catalog. Delivery Addresses Myth:  eProcurement automatically knows where my requested items are to be delivered. Reality:  Without a delivery address and phone number, your order will be delayed.  Before filling your shopping cart, click the ""Default settings for items"" button, accessible by clicking the triangle next to the cart icon in the lower left-hand side of the screen. Enter the complete delivery address and phone number under the ""Delivery address"" tab.  Click the ""?"" and then ""go"" to locate ship to address rather than entering the address data. Timesaving Tip:  Updating My Settings from the main eProcurement screen eliminates the need to enter Building, Floor / Room, and Extension within the delivery address. eProcurement Catalog Myth:  The eProcurement Catalog does not contain the office supply items I need to order. Reality:  The most frequently purchased office supply items from Corporate Express and Lee Stationery & Office Supply Co. are in the eProcurement Catalog. Hard Copy Catalog Tip:  If you are referencing the hard copy catalog while searching the eProcurement Catalog, please take note. * For Corporate Express: Drop the first 3-alpha characters from the MFG #.  For example, search for MFG # MMM2018 by entering 2018. * For Lee Stationery & Office Supply Co.: Drop the first 3-alpha characters and remove any dashes from the Product No.  For example, search for Product No. MMM 6539-YW by entering 6539YW. Quick Search Tip:  If you know the manufacturer part number, you can enter it in the Quick Search field under the Catalog's first tab. Product Request Tip:  If you searched the eProcurement Catalog and are unable to find the item, you may request the Catalog Team to add it.  Use the Product Request feature from the Advanced Search screen to do so, and include your name and contact information in the Comments field.  You may alternatively e-mail ibuyit.catalog@enron.com, or call Mark Hudgens at 713-345-6544. Look up the Product Request Overview in the ISC Document library: <http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp>. Navigate to iBuyit eProcurement > Requestor > Make a Product Request > Product Request Overview.

eProcurement With one week behind us and many Shopping Carts processed for IT hardware and office supplies, iBuyit wants to share what we've learned from your feedback and provide you specific information to help you maximize eProcurement.  This first update covers delivery addresses, IT standard hardware templates, and office supplies.  Over the next several weeks, iBuyit will continue to provide you updates on a regular basis. How to Make Sure You Receive Your Purchase Request! Before you begin to shop, verify that your Delivery Address information is correct under Default Settings for Items.  Why?  If no delivery address is entered, you or the intended recipient will experience a delay in receiving your order. * Click on the ? button to search for street address information. * Use the c/o field to enter the name of the intended recipient. * Update My Settings from the main eProcurement screen to set up Building, Room, and Extension information that will automatically default to your Default Address. Locate additional details in Section II of the Requestor Quick Reference Card. IT Standard Hardware Templates * The iBuyit Catalog team is aggressively working to resolve the duplication of IT Standard Templates names appearing under the Table of Contents tab.  All of the template links are working.  Thank you for your patience. * Use the standard templates to order common workstations (desktops and laptops), and click Select All.  Why?  Net Works has bundled all necessary components for each common workstation.  If you don't select all, you will receive only a partial setup. Office Supplies * Use the Catalog to select office supplies.  Why?  Purchasing will reject all office supply requests entered as non-catalog items.  If you are unable to locate an office supply item, contact the iBuyit Catalog team to add the item or use an alternative method to purchase the item. * Create separate Shopping Carts for office supplies and IT hardware items.  Why?  The processing of office supply requests will be delayed if combined with IT hardware.  All carts containing IT hardware items are routed to Purchasing for final review before processing. * Corporate Express and Lee are committed to next day delivery.  However, if you have questions about your order, contact the appropriate vendor and provide either the Company Number and Cost Assignment or the Purchase Order Number: - Corporate Express at 713-853-6294 - David Yee or Faye Hopkins at Lee Stationery and Office Supply Co at 713-227-1201 Summer Tip:  Please remind your Approver to establish a Substitute before they are away from the office for an extended period.  You can locate instructions on the Approver Quick Reference Card. Need Training? * Visit the ISC Education Center to sign-up for system demonstrations and/or hands-on classroom training, and to access on-line training: <http://iscedcenter.enron.com> * Visit the ISC Document Library for Quick Reference Cards and other helpful training materials: <http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp> Did You Receive Your eProcurement Welcome Packet? An eProcurement Welcome Packet, which includes Spend/Approval Limits, Whom to Contact for Help, and Quick Reference Cards, was sent to all identified users.  If you have not received a packet, please e-mail iBuyit. Questions? * For help using eProcurement, contact Integrated Solutions Center Customer Care at 713-345-4727. * For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication. The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication. Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach. Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com. We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings. We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com. U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled. 
All applications residing on the R: drive will be temporarily unavailable from Friday, September 21, 2001 at 11:00 P.M. until 11:30 PM for users logging into the CORP domain serviced by Enron Net Works.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670. 
Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin. EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight. EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity. 
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively. If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network. Thank you. 
Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses. This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are: ?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International ?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS ?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners ?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric ?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix ?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp ?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water ?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by: ?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO ?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel ?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction ?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS ?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO ?

Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities. Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets. 
Everyone, Once again, there are a number of new viruses that have been released on the internet that are causing us to do frequent updates to our virus protection software. We have an automated process to update our workstations with the latest virus protection updates.   However, there may be some machines that didn't get the update.  In order to prevent these viruses from infecting your machine, please assist by doing one of the following tasks. 1.  Logout of the network and log back in or 2.  Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button.  This will pop up a screen where you will have to click the ""Next"" button and then a ""Finish"" button.   (If you are an EES user, you will only be able to use option #1 as you use a different virus protection product.) The proper version of the update pattern you need is:   (9/24/2001, version 30924p) If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to your Resolution Center. 
Everyone, In an effort to protect our computing systems from viruses and other potential threats, we have disabled the ability to get to external e-mail sites (AOL, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) while you are using an Enron computer connected to our network. If you are using a particular external e-mail site for valid business reasons and this action we have taken has impacted your business, you can contact your Resolution Center for assistance.  Each case will be analyzed for validity and exceptions granted based on business related needs. Thank you for your understanding that protecting our revenue generating systems is our highest priority.

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel. The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules. We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website. 
I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel. Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant. Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som= e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne= l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, = there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th= e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti= es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi= ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business. Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con= trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit= e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email = (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B= rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas= e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, = or to report security threats. We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t= he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory. Access to the Enron Center Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins= tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical): ?As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron = Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer. ?Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid = picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S= . or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif= ication).=20 ?Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing= in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca= rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o= r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica= tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center. ?Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b= adged contractor at all times. ?Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo= yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio= n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm= ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to= the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected= , and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the = escorting employee or badged contractor. ?Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their = workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu= rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y= ou or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others. These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit= uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times= in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi= pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the= se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees.  Travel Advisory Update With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda= tions: ?While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend= s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str= ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak= istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo= rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that = planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara= bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. ?For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit= y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent = reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question= ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re= sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni= ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th= eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest= that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card= as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi= gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National= ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""regi= stration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen= t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros= sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his= torically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, = but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it= would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c= urrent lawful status. We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor= ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock. The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options. You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address. Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com. ?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights ?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ?

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Here is a resume that surfaced from Emilio Battioli at Azurix Buenos Aires. 
What do you think of this? 
Dear Mr. Emilio Battioli, I am an LL.M. candidate (August 2001) at the University of Michigan Law School. I am very happy to have found the attorney in Enron Corporation who has studied at the University of Warwick, the institution from which I have graduated, too. I have always been eager to practise law in a corporation and at the moment I am looking for a job in the South of the US. Therefore, I have decided to write to you contemplating that Enron Corporation may be interested in utilizing my credentials. As a native of Lithuania with a law and business degree from the University of Warwick, I have had extensive international business and personal experience in UK, Eastern Europe and Russia. I did an internship in Oil Trading International and Legal Departments of BP Amoco PLC, London. I also gained some corporate work experience when doing an internship in Harden & Wells in Beijing. To gain further insight into corporate and securities matters, I have focused on business related classes at the University of Michigan Law School. I would really appreciate if you had a look at my resume, which is attached to this e-mail. Thank you ever so much. Sincerely, Lina Nagyte _________________________________________________________________________ Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com. - Lina resume.doc

Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments. We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program. Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary). The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance). National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs. Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available. When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974) To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>. 
The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group. In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. Crude and Products group Mid-marketing Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett. Origination In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. Trading Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas. Shipping Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line. Weather The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets. Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system. ENA West Power Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators. IN THE NEWS ""To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling."" --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001. Calgary, Alberta -- Enron Canada has settled its lawsuit with NGX, Canadian Enerdata, OM Gruppen and Richard Zarzeczny, regarding the compilation and methodology for calculating the Alberta natural gas price indices published by the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer. Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.

Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program. This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000. So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company. Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable. Enron Freight Markets During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks. EnronOnline On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives. Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001 ?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million ?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion IN THE NEWS Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

When you leave the program, you will have: R	An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to Enron's transactions. R	A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the ""deal space"" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	Enron deals. R	The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron deal.

Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments. We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program. Find Out how to Join The Downtown Club May 29 & 30!

EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 29, 2001. *	Total Life to Date Transactions >  1,015,000 *	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $610 billion NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Enron Global LNG Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market. IN THE NEWS Enron Corp.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary). The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance). National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs. Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available. When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974) To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery. Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free. If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South. Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6. We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that: ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING. Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas. We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation. 
Ken Lay has a special video message for you about the Sept. 11 tragedy.  Please go to ""Up Front"" at <http://home.enron.com/upfront/> to access it.

""Up Front"" will feature open, honest and timely video messages from the Office of the Chairman and Enron management about what's going on around the company. 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility. Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars. Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability. EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new ""Morning Briefing"" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days: ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000 EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox. We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September. If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. IN THE NEWS Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8 Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13. California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand. ``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented: - Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, - Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry - All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections. The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets. 
In preparation for the new Travel Center that will coincide with the opening of Enron Center South,  Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) will be consolidating its two Enron locations.

If you currently pick up tickets and/or e-ticket receipts in 3 Allen Center, Suite 150, beginning on October 1, 2001 please pick up your tickets at the TAP location on the third floor in the Enron Building.

I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel. Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant. Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties. 
Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity! This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo. The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community. 
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel. The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules. We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication. The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication. Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach. Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Everyone, In an effort to protect our computing systems from viruses and other potential threats, we have disabled the ability to get to external e-mail sites (AOL, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) while you are using an Enron computer connected to our network. If you are using a particular external e-mail site for valid business reasons and this action we have taken has impacted your business, you can contact your Resolution Center for assistance.  Each case will be analyzed for validity and exceptions granted based on business related needs. Thank you for your understanding that protecting our revenue generating systems is our highest priority. 
Everyone, Once again, there are a number of new viruses that have been released on the internet that are causing us to do frequent updates to our virus protection software. We have an automated process to update our workstations with the latest virus protection updates.   However, there may be some machines that didn't get the update.  In order to prevent these viruses from infecting your machine, please assist by doing one of the following tasks. 1.  Logout of the network and log back in or 2.

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively. If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network. Thank you.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets In a combined effort, Global Risk Markets (GRM), a unit of Enron Global Markets, and Southeast Power Origination, part of Enron Americas, closed Enron's first Contingent Call Outage Option in the 1st quarter 2001. The product was created to provide customers with a cost effective risk management tool to hedge against high commodity prices after experiencing an unplanned power generation outage. The transaction was entered into with UtiliCorp United to manage its generation risk for summer 2001. This risk is associated with a forced outage of their largest coal unit during peak summer demand. The transaction, which was developed jointly with the Southeast Power group, highlights the benefits of cooperation between business units within Enron. GRM is working with a number of business units to integrate this risk management product into other Enron businesses to enhance value to our customers.  For additional information on the product, please call David Hoog in the New York office at 212 702 3920.

It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family. Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed. Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999. We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions. 
Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities. With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden. These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations. These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments. We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program. Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1. How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website. ?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. ?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/> o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon. o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. ?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking. ?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers. ?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday. For Counseling Assistance ?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. ?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need. This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary). The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance). National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs. Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available. When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974) To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family. Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed. Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999. We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication. The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication. Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach. Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Pipeline integrity and safety have risen to new levels of public concern.  In the aftermath of the incidents at Bellingham, Washington and Carlsbad, New Mexico new pipeline safety regulations and legislation will require increased focus on pipeline integrity programs.  As a proactive approach to address these concerns, ETS Operations is establishing a Pipeline Integrity Program Management Group.  This group will be responsible for pipeline integrity issues for EOTT and ETS and financial reporting of EOTT's environmental and remediation projects.  The group will include the following functions:  corrosion, pipeline safety and pipeline integrity. I am pleased to announce that Mike Nelson will relocate to Houston to lead this new initiative, as Vice President Pipeline Integrity Program Management.  Reporting directly to Mike are Max Brown and Dave Johnson. The establishment of this new function, along with Mike's move, has given us the opportunity to rotate key staff, allowing us to achieve a broader knowledge base for the future of ETS Operations.  I am pleased to announce the following additional changes: Rick Craig - Vice President Southeast Operations Dan Pribble - Vice President Southwest Operations Randy Rice - Senior Director North Operations Rick Craig and Dan Pribble will continue to office in Houston.  Randy will transfer to the Omaha office. Don Hawkins will assume new responsibility for controls & electrical, measurement and the Clifton Machine Shop as Vice President Technical Services.  He will also continue to handle facility audits, quality management, and business development initiatives.  John Shafer, Vice President Environmental, Health & Safety, will continue to be responsible for environmental compliance and remediation, and health and safety.  John Keller, Vice President Planning & Power Services, will assume responsibility for the Beaver Machine Shop in addition to his current responsibilities.  Jerry Martin, Vice President Engineering & Construction, will continue in his current role. The Skill Based Pay Field Training Administration group will now report to Morris Brassfield, Senior Director, Operations Support Services. All changes will be effective October 1.  Please join me in congratulating these individuals on their new assignments. 
Enron Transportation Services has 2115 outstanding invoices totaling nearly $8.5 million, which need coding and/or approval in the iPayit system.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, ETS employees need to do their part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. If you purchase items that generate an invoice (including cell phones, pagers, etc.) or if you are responsible for coding and/or approving invoices, after you receive your e-mail notification, please log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action to process the invoice (s) . Because the invoice (s)  cannot be processed for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox, it's important to code/approve invoices within five (5) days of e-mail notification. I expect ETS to stay current on payment of ALL vendor invoices. I have approved invoices in the system and it's very to use.  We will continue to monitor the status of our accounts payable, and we expect to see significant improvement by the end of September. If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Carolyn Centilli at 713-345-8496.   Password questions should be directed to the ISC help desk, 713-345-4727. Thank you for your commitment to improving our accounts payable process and for paying our vendors on time.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary). The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance). National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs. Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available. When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974) To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets The Transaction Development group (TD) is responsible for corporate development, transaction execution and portfolio management activities within EIM.

TD works with EIM's Forest Products and Steel Origination groups to structure and execute complex transactions for EIM's customers.

EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 29, 2001. *	Total Life to Date Transactions >  1,015,000 *	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $610 billion NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable. Enron Freight Markets During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks. EnronOnline On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives. Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001 ?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million ?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion IN THE NEWS Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our em= ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for= Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w= e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20 ?During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc= hange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,= which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be= tter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap= pears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan= ge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug. ?Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience= d database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou= tlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan= ge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv= er.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --= we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit= h the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus= iness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W= ednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov= e users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac= ted users could not access their e-mail. ?During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger= ous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus= es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail = is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop= s.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning= updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. = The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance= of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus = product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w= e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co= mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t= ime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that = will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th= e performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to = get better. There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las= t few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the= overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and= meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed. What This Change Means To You Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1. How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website. ?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. ?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.

We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need. This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information. 
As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.

It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively. If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network. Thank you.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

Our vision to become The World's Leading Company positions our company for great success this year and beyond.  Our success is dependent on execution.  With that in mind, we are making Enron's 2001 corporate and business unit goals available to employees. 
At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own. There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following: ?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. ""Professional Services"" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com. ?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/. ?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall. Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader. ?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible. ?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com. ?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S. ?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311. Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit. 
Rod- I suspect your question here only pertains to Wessex and that you don't care about any credit for the other Azurix businesses? 
Would each of you send me a copy of your credit policies or the rules relative to granting of credit (credit extended to customers)?     I would expect that it will be in the tariff or some other regulatory document, or even a charteer or license.    I don't need the whole document, only the portion relative to credit.    Please fax or email to me. Thanks. Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 FAX 713-646-3708 
Rick: Attached is follow-up analysis that Kenny Bickett, John Garrison and I have completed on the Azurix potential asset sales and impairments.  The analysis reflects a $305 million charge, or $294 million after tax. We have assumed asset values that we would place at the 90% confidence level.  These numbers are slightly higher than you saw before as a result of (1)  our taking a 90% confidence level approach and (2) further analysis on Lurgi which reflects an impairment based upon a controlled shut-down alternative rather than a sale.  The numbers also include our recent litigation settlement, Azurix Corp severances, and Azurix Corp PP&E impairments. We would be available at any time to discuss this analysis with you.  Since AA has not reviewed any of this information, the next step is to get AA to confirm the analysis and numbers.  We will wait on your approval to take this step.  Please let me know when to proceed. Thanks, Michael Anderson 
Rod, I mentioned to you that we had met with the Enron SAP team several weeks ago to discuss pros and cons of Azurix Corp. moving to SAP.  Our main reason for exploring this was the fact that key functions in closing our Oracle books, due to attrition, were only known by one employee.  This employee is a manager (Virginia Krobot), and the other remaining permanent accounting staff is an accounting clerk and two A/P people.  There are some parts of the closing that are only being performed by AccountTemps personnel.  We are transitioning these to Azurix employees as we can. I spoke today to Mark Schmidt with the SAP team.  I told him before we moved any further on exploring this option, I thought we should get your thoughts. 
Rod, We get one template from each operating company at a specified level in the ownership chain.  This template contains the minimum number of accounts necessary in order to achieve our external reporting requirements.  For example, an operating company will submit a template with only one G&A account.  However, they will report interest expense gross of capitalized interest since we disclose our capitalized interest in a footnote.  Any intercompany accounts which get eliminated in consolidation are detailed out.  The templates are manually entered into Oracle. Most of the Cayco's and BV companies which sit above the operating companies only have equity earnings and interest expense/income type entries and those are accounted for here.  Azurix Corp. has more detail type entries but these are primarily G&A, DD&A, intercompany billings and equity earnings. Kenny 
Rod, In the past, we have negotiated our audit fees with AA separate from Enron.  In addition, we are billed separate from Enron.  This is the time of year that I would plan on starting discussions with AA for 2001 audit fees.  Estimated fees for 2000 were approximately $1mm which includes statutory audits for certain entities in addition to the overall US GAAP audit. What is the policy/guideline under which we should proceed with AA?  Would Enron prefer to negotiate this in their overall discussion for the Enron audit and then allocate to Azurix an appropriate amount? Thanks -- Kenny 
Rod, In the voice mail I just left you I said we had a $0.4mm improvement in Q2 from the $25.3mm.  I spoke too soon.  We are still on track for the $25.3mm. 
Rod - I thought you might like to see the kind of informational reports we get from our operating companies each month.  Attached please find the reports we get from Wessex.  Wessex prepares the report in both local currency and USD, since we have had impacts for the weakening of the GBP. These are not the reports that Kenny uses to consolidate results as those are less detailed and also include some management reporting adjustments.  We have been getting these every month since March 2000.  If you would like them going back, please let me know.  Currently these reports are due the 15th of each month.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks! David

This group will be responsible for pipeline integrity issues for EOTT and ETS and financial reporting of EOTT's environmental and remediation projects.  The group will include the following functions:  corrosion, pipeline safety and pipeline integrity. I am pleased to announce that Mike Nelson will relocate to Houston to lead this new initiative, as Vice President Pipeline Integrity Program Management.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 29, 2001. *	Total Life to Date Transactions >  1,015,000 *	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $610 billion NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable. Enron Freight Markets During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks. EnronOnline On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives. Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001 ?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million ?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion IN THE NEWS Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results. 
As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery. Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free. If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

The customer, based in= Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be ta= king gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base= load. In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team co= mpleted a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbe= nt player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected= in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had= to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German= y in order to close the gas supply deal.  ""Although we are happy that we ha= ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac= tual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net= work operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the neg= otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor= t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France,"" commented Carsten H= aack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke a= nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important el= ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran= sportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after = Ruhrgas. ""This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, = especially in East Germany, "" said Haack. ""But more importantly, this deal = will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo= mers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network = operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!"" he added.

A new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two milli= on tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Pont's nylon plant= s.

These are fee-free transactions. -  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations). -  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations). -  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month. Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible. Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible. Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible. We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions: -  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day. -  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m. -  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up. -  Sign up for QuickLink - Internet Account Access.  QuickLink is free and allows you to verify cleared checks and posted deposits, transfer funds and more, all from the convenience of your computer.  Sign up at enronfcu.com. -  Sign up for QuickTeller - Automated Phone System.  QuickTeller is also a free service that allows you to perform all of the same functions as QuickLink, but by telephone.  Go to enronfcu.com to sign up. 
It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it. If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer. Thank you very much for your support.

Are you creative? Do you have a great imagination? Can you create something out of nothing? Are you fast on your feet? If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, then I have a challenge for you! We are looking to create a team of 7-10 people to build a model of Enron's attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  You will be provided with the building materials and you will have a total of 45 minutes to work along with your teammates to get your model completed.  Oh, did I mention that your materials will consist only of Legos?  That's right - LEGOS. Here is the layout - Friday, August 10th 11:00 a.m. 	Teams assemble to begin construction. 11:45 a.m. 	Construction is complete. 12:00 p.m. 	Ken Lay will host - The Applause Meter. The winning team will then be recognized by Mr. Lay and he will 					follow up with an e-mail to all Houston employees. Here are the guidelines - 1.  Teams must consist of 7-10 members from your Business Unit.  I need to have at least 3 executives (Directors, Vice 				     	     Presidents, or Managing Directors) to this team. 2.  The model must be free-standing. 3.  Your choice of other materials may be used! Be sure to encourage your co-workers to come and cheer you on!  Please give me a call or e-mail me if you are interested in participating.  After the competition, the Legos will be donated to local non-profit child care centers. Thank you, Julie Clyatt 
In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES. I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort. Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations: Mark Breese	EB-1457a Ed McMichael	EB-1456c Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We appreciate there are many questions that remain unanswered, but for the moment our thoughts and prayers are with those we have lost and their families and friends.

Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed. What This Change Means To You Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area. To re-program an Auto-Dial button: ?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys ?         Press the Program button on your soft keys ?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program ?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below) ?

Due to the overwhelming response from Enron employees and contractors, today's blood drive appointments are completely full, and there are a large number of you who still wish to donate blood.  We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured.  For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext. 3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building.  We recognize and are grateful to the many of you who are wanting to give blood today, but ask that you be patient and understand our inability to accept walk-in donations at this time.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1. How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website. ?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. ?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/> o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon. o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. ?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking. ?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers. ?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday. For Counseling Assistance ?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. ?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need. This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Everyone, As we stated earlier, this particular virus that is on the internet is causing a lot of issues for Corporations.  As a result, the companies who write anti-virus software are continuously updating their software.  As of this morning, another update has been made available to us.  This update does a better job of protecting your PC than the update we received last night. At this time, it is extremely important that you again go through one of the procedures listed below to get the latest update. 1.  Logout of the network and log back in or 2.  Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button.  This will pop up a screen where you will have to click the ""Next"" button and then a ""Finish"" button.  - If you are an EES user, this option is not available to you.  Please use option 1. The proper version of the update pattern you need is:   (9/18/2001, version 30918BL) - You may need to restart the Norton Anti-Virus client if you want to visually insure that you have the latest update. If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to your Resolution Center. 
In response to the recent Nimda virus alert, it is necessary for all users to log off of their machines when leaving for the day.  The Global Infrastructure team will be canvassing the workstation environment to ensure that all virus definitions are current and up to date. Thanks for your continued cooperation, 
As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com. We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings. We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com. U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled. 
11, 2001 
In light of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001, our concern is to support our employees through this difficult time.  We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of a resource available to you, Enron's Employee Assistance Program.  This service is available to you or any member of your immediate family to provide counseling services.  To talk to a counselor, simply call (713) 853-6057 during business hours in Houston or the 24 hour service line at (800) 345-1391.  If you are outside the US, please contact your Human Resources Representative for further details.  Please also be aware of any colleagues who may require assistance during this time and may not be able to seek help for themselves. 
Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses. This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world. Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water. Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are: ?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International ?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS ?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners ?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric ?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix ?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp ?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water ?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by: ?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO ?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel ?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction ?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS ?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO ?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR ?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick. Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities. Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets. 
Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our em= ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for= Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w= e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20 ?During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc= hange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,= which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be= tter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap= pears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan= ge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug. ?Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience= d database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou= tlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan= ge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv= er.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --= we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit= h the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus= iness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W= ednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov= e users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac= ted users could not access their e-mail. ?During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger= ous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus= es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail = is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop= s.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning= updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. = The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance= of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus = product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w= e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co= mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t= ime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that = will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th= e performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to = get better. There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las= t few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the= overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and= meet Enron's business needs and expectations. 
Everyone, In an effort to protect our computing systems from viruses and other potential threats, we have disabled the ability to get to external e-mail sites (AOL, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) while you are using an Enron computer connected to our network. If you are using a particular external e-mail site for valid business reasons and this action we have taken has impacted your business, you can contact your Resolution Center for assistance.  Each case will be analyzed for validity and exceptions granted based on business related needs. Thank you for your understanding that protecting our revenue generating systems is our highest priority. 
We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock. The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options. You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address. Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com. ?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights ?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ?	A ""How to Exercise Options"" document that contains contact information and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options 
As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing. For Houston-based employees: The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby. Harris		713-368-2309 Montgomery	936-539-7843 Waller		979-826-7643 Brazoria	979-864-1320 Fort Bend	281-341-8670 Liberty		936-336-4629 Chambers	409-267-8301 
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel. The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules. We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable. Enron Freight Markets During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks. EnronOnline On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives. Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001 ?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million ?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion IN THE NEWS Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets. Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system. ENA West Power Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators. IN THE NEWS ""To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling."" --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001. Calgary, Alberta -- Enron Canada has settled its lawsuit with NGX, Canadian Enerdata, OM Gruppen and Richard Zarzeczny, regarding the compilation and methodology for calculating the Alberta natural gas price indices published by the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program. This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000. So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company. Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery. Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free. If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results. 
I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel. Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant. Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively. If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network. Thank you. 
Ken Lay has a video message for you about the Chairman's Award on ""Up Front.""  Please go to ""Up Front"" at http://home.enron.com/upfront/ to access it.

This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable Processing Centers Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement and payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central.  But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution. In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system. Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information: *  Company Number or Legal Entity Name *  Contact Name *  Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number *  New P.O. Box  (See Below) What is an EID? An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders? Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders. Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders? No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do. What if I do not know my EID? All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  You can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose ""Personal Information"" to pull up your personal profile.  On the left side of the ""Personal Information"" screen select ""Other"" and you will see your: *  PID (SAP ID) *  GIS ID *  EID What is our new mailing address (PO Box)? Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address: PO Box 4734 Houston, TX  77210-4734 What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me? HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope ""Attention Enron Accounts Payable,"" and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enron mail center. FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston.  Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address: 3724 Dacoma Houston, TX  77092 ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE Note:  ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally. How will vendors learn about these changes? This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate communication. Questions?  Send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com> 
Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary). The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance). National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs. Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available. When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974) To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed. What This Change Means To You Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.

Electricity Deregulation is coming to Texas! What a great way to start off the New Year - to be able to choose your electricity provider, which could mean potential savings for you and your family on your electric bill.  As you know, Enron has been a leader in lobbying for deregulation and a consumer's right to choose energy providers. For the first time in our state's history, 5 percent of Texas households will have this golden opportunity.  The NewPower Company (NewPower), which is approximately 45 percent owned by Enron, was recently formed to provide energy and energy-related services to residential customers in deregulating energy markets across America, including Texas.  For a limited time, Houston-based employees will be eligible to participate in NewPower's pilot program offering their deregulated electric service. Be Among the First to Participate: Enrollment with NewPower begins March 12.  Also, watch for a special Enron Employees Exclusive offer on your desk March 12.  If you would like more information about NewPower, visit the company's web site at www.newpower.com Disclaimers:

At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own. There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following: ?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. ""Professional Services"" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com. ?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/. ?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall. Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader. ?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible. ?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com. ?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S. ?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311. Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit. 
We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication. The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication. Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach. Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees. 
As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing. For Houston-based employees: The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel. The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules. We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website. 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility. Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars. Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

IN THE NEWS Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8 Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13. California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand. ``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented: - Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, - Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry - All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections. The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets. 
This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South. Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6. We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that: ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING. Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas. We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation. 
Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.

Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery. Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free. If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets. Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system. ENA West Power Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows. EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo. The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval. Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events. 1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA. 3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form. 4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval. Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts. If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978. Thank you for your cooperation.

Treatment 
Management and employees both have roles in meeting Enron's commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and Harassment Prevention.  To achieve Enron's vision, we need to recruit, select, retain, and manage the most talented people effectively.  We expect all employees to demonstrate Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.  Our efforts to achieve equal employment, and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive, inventive, and competitive as possible in a world of changes. Enron is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer.  In choosing to do business with federal, state, and city government agencies, Enron implements affirmative action plans (AAP) to recruit, retain, and promote women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and covered veterans.  Our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices, individual qualifications and merit.  Employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace, including recruitment, applicant screening, hiring, training, assignments, compensation, benefits, job performance evaluation, disciplinary action, separation, and the like.  There is no place at Enron for management practices that include bias, favoritism, discrimination, harassment, or conduct that otherwise violates the law or Company policy. Enron's Harassment Prevention Policy was developed to prevent harassment and help all employees to maintain a productive and mutually rewarding work relationship.  Harassment of any type, including sexual harassment, is contrary to our policy and preventable with education and respectful personal behavior.  We want all employees to know what harassment is, how to prevent it and how to report it.  Our policy outlines these unacceptable behaviors and helps employees better understand work-related expectations and steps.  Every employee at Enron is expected to prevent harassment and report it if it happens. Enron's Fair Treatment Policy was developed to provide and maintain a work environment in which all employees are treated equitably.  Our goal is to resolve employment disputes promptly, informally and (where possible) at the lowest level.  Employees who believe they are treated unfairly are encouraged to discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor.  When a concern of unfair, unlawful or unsafe treatment is raised, it will be investigated thoroughly and promptly.  An effective resolution will be reached based on all the information.  The Company will take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality, but must act on assertions indicating that a violation of policy or law has occurred. Each of these policies is available for review at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Please familiarize yourself with these policies.  Enron expects and encourages every worker to report workplace issues of concern.  If you need to speak with anyone someone regarding these policies or if an incident occurs that concerns you, please talk with your supervisor, contact your Human Resources representative, or call Enron's Office of Labor and Employment Relations Department at 713-853-7573.  Management is expected to ensure retaliation does not occur.  In addition, Cindy Olson, as  is Enron's EEO officer.  As and  Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations, Cindy has the responsibility, authority, and full support of Enron to ensure that all employees can avail themselves of our policies. Your support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment.  In turn, such personal and organizational success adds to Enron's business success.

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors. Now it's time to look forward. With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer. Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child. In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work. Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments. We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program. Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.

Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000. So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company. Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable. Enron Freight Markets During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks. EnronOnline On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives. Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001 ?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million ?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion IN THE NEWS Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 29, 2001. *	Total Life to Date Transactions >  1,015,000 *	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $610 billion NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results. 
This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South. Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6. We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that: ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING. Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas. We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation. 
We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock. The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options. You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows. EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo. The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval. Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events. 1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA. 3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form. 4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval. Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts. If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978. Thank you for your cooperation. 
Reminder! The Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast is just a few days away. Please RSVP if you have not already done so. 
Last year, Enron employees generously donated a record $2.8 million to the United Way, an amount which exceeded our goal of $2.3 million by nearly half a million dollars.  This year we are setting our sights even higher with a goal of $2.9 million.  When matched dollar for dollar by Enron, our total contribution would be $5.8 million. This goal is a challenging one, but we believe it is achievable with your help.  It is also a far-reaching goal with the United Way touching 1 out of every 2 lives in the greater Houston area. To kick-off this year's campaign, please join us for the EWS Leadership Giving Reception in the Bluebonnet Ballroom at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 1700 Smith St. on Tuesday, July 31 from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m.  The adopted agency for EWS this year is the Center for the Retarded.  Representatives from the center and recipients of Enron's United Way Scholars program will be there to share their experiences with you.  We will also review the campaign objectives for this year. Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and bonus programs, we invite you to help by joining us as a member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society with your generous donation of $10,000 or more to the United Way.  In 2000, Enron was the Society's leader in Houston with 49 members, and we also ranked in the top 25 nationally in total membership.  Your support this year will help Enron to continue as a leader among companies in this distinguished group. Whatever your decision regarding your pledge, we need 100% participation from our executives in order to set a good example for the rest of EWS.  Your contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our community.  When you give, you change a life right here in the Houston area. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores via e-mail at zulie.flores@enron.com or by phone at ext. 3-3908 by Friday, July 27 and join us in setting the standard for EWS by giving generously and getting your pledge in by August 10. Mark and Greg 
As we prepare for the kick-off of Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, Building Houston's Future, we are asking our top-level executives to set the standard of giving during the Leadership Giving Campaign that will run from July 23 through August 3. The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs. Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way. You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans. The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26. Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com. At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are. Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001. We look forward to seeing you at breakfast on the 31st. 
Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.

Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Please join me at this year's conference to plan our strategy and success for the new year and beyond. Watch for an agenda and registration information in the next few weeks.  I look forward to a good meeting and to seeing you there. Regards,

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows. EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo. The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval. Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events. 1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA. 3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form. 4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval. Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts. If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978. Thank you for your cooperation. 
Reminder! The Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast is just a few days away. Please RSVP if you have not already done so. 
Last year, Enron employees generously donated a record $2.8 million to the United Way, an amount which exceeded our goal of $2.3 million by nearly half a million dollars.  This year we are setting our sights even higher with a goal of $2.9 million.  When matched dollar for dollar by Enron, our total contribution would be $5.8 million. This goal is a challenging one, but we believe it is achievable with your help.  It is also a far-reaching goal with the United Way touching 1 out of every 2 lives in the greater Houston area. To kick-off this year's campaign, please join us for the EWS Leadership Giving Reception in the Bluebonnet Ballroom at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 1700 Smith St. on Tuesday, July 31 from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m.  The adopted agency for EWS this year is the Center for the Retarded.  Representatives from the center and recipients of Enron's United Way Scholars program will be there to share their experiences with you.  We will also review the campaign objectives for this year. Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and bonus programs, we invite you to help by joining us as a member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society with your generous donation of $10,000 or more to the United Way.  In 2000, Enron was the Society's leader in Houston with 49 members, and we also ranked in the top 25 nationally in total membership.  Your support this year will help Enron to continue as a leader among companies in this distinguished group. Whatever your decision regarding your pledge, we need 100% participation from our executives in order to set a good example for the rest of EWS.  Your contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our community.  When you give, you change a life right here in the Houston area. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores via e-mail at zulie.flores@enron.com or by phone at ext. 3-3908 by Friday, July 27 and join us in setting the standard for EWS by giving generously and getting your pledge in by August 10. Mark and Greg 
As we prepare for the kick-off of Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, Building Houston's Future, we are asking our top-level executives to set the standard of giving during the Leadership Giving Campaign that will run from July 23 through August 3. The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs. Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way. You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans. The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26. Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com. At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are. Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001. We look forward to seeing you at breakfast on the 31st. 
Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.

Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results. 
Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses. This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

=20 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS EBS Joins EWS Effective, July 12, EBS has become a business unit within Enron Wholesale S= ervices.  All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into thos= e units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and cos= ts of the support functions. All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following unit= s: Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidat= ed into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and ri= sk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also over= see the global portfolio from a risk management perspective. Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the = Chairman. All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo= st effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be= closed by October 1. Global Strategic Sourcing Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implem= ented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel an= d entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing (""GS= S"") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to en= list your support in the implementation of these new procedures. This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message w= ill focus on professional services. Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on tr= avel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adju= stments. ?Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the = travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts= have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separa= te channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  T= he first is Travel Agency in the Park (""TAP""), or the GSS-approved preferre= d travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed = online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enro= n.com/enron>. Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri= p, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of re= asons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, Clic= kTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for = their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry = data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective trave= l decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking= , we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use o= f this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, Click= Trip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and aft= er-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questio= ns, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311. =20 One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the= United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 perce= nt less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying= a $100 fee. ?Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a n= umber of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business= unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates i= ncluding insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.= ) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is availabl= e regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel= .enron.com>. Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, p= ulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001= .  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 = tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, = and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving appr= oximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled pape= r), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throu= ghout the world. =20 Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physica= l product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 mil= lion tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of = customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, a= nd physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coor= dinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and= Singapore. Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have= a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and= a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per ye= ar.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordin= ated through the EIM Logistics Group. Enron Global Markets - LNG Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with = volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed = a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billio= n cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a = two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility= .  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents= a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network. EGM - Finance & Structuring On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed t= he divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via a= n all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial a= nd industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker= trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR= , Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstand= ing shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. (""Tropigas"").  Upon co= mpletion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market pla= yer will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market sha= re, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer.=20 The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between P= rotane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (S= JG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Carib= e.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million.=20 The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail p= ropane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Pr= otane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy t= he cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resourc= es.=20 EGM - Weather The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect the= m against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innova= tive winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both t= he volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Ch= icago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals = with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season. Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  = To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is look= ing for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interes= ted in a position, please contact Elsa. WELCOME New Hires EGM  - Chevondra Auzenne, Anuj Gupta, Lois Stone, Rich Friedman EIM   - Brian Gaughan, Jennifer Basinski ENA  - Juli Salvagio, Pepi Beltran, Oliver Jones Transfers (to or within) ENA  - Jinsung Myung, Russell Diamond, Chris Helfrich, Jerry Farmer, Kenton= Erwin EGM - Meredith Campbell, Martin Gleason, Maritta Mullet, Dorothy Burrell, L= uis Castillo, James Posway, Ted Behrens, Michael Mitcham EnronOnline Statistics Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of July 17, 2001: Total Life to Date Transactions  > 1,214,000 Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions  > $711 billion NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic qua= rter! =20 By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 ea= rnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thurs= day, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with= revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up = from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this qu= arter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quart= er up from $0.34 for the same period last year. Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quar= ter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some = terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Contin= ental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to streng= th as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this q= uarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in = Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year co= mpared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions= per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volum= es are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in th= e same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue= /day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental= power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in = the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The = growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, = however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 T= Wh in the first half of 2001. The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however,= and abound throughout the business: Enron Energy Services The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the clos= ing of EES' first, major ""marquis"" brand energy outsourcing transaction wit= h supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's= business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000. = The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the devel= opment of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, m= ore recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct= Canada. =20 Enron Credit A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value o= f transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, En= ron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 read= ers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent public= ations.  =20 Enron Australia With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this yea= r, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the develo= pment of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading i= n Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial purs= uit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant= expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather der= ivatives.=20 Spain:  Arcos The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progre= ss with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being succ= essfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milesto= ne in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water = concession in Q2. UK:  ETOL ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet= another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series o= f deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. T= he transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one o= f ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power sup= ply contract through 2010. =20 Enron Metals A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased = volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quart= er with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 = million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen po= sitive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share = of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Proje= ct Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline = deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the met= als team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten= -year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets= , will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transac= tion proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's tradin= g and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups a= cross Enron.  =20 Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we'= ve witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through= end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, wh= en talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter= , ""Europe is kicking butt and it's about a quarter of [Enron's] activity, n= early double what it was last year.  And, that is a new market that is the = size of the US."" =20 LEGAL STUFF The information contained in this newsletter is confidential and proprietar= y to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries.

Mr Lay: I am the Director of Field Operations for Houston Pipe Line Company and request your support on a simple, yet important matter. As currently planned, the employees of Houston Pipe Line will transfer to  American Electric Power effective June1. Our field employees look forward to this change with the mixed emotions of new opportunities and challenges but equally with the pride that HPL was one of the original building blocks of the great company that Enron has become today. My request is for a simple thank you from you to our employees for the work that they have done for Enron. The professionalism and pride from the last 75 years will go with HPL -----  but not without remembering the significant achievements of Enron. Thank you for your consideration. VR, Ron Green

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively. If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network. Thank you.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1. How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.

If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website. ?

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program. This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000. So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company. Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively. Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months. Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni. Enron in the Middle East Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar. Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase. Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS eSource eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode. Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed. As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets. IN THE NEWS Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals 06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. ""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary). The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance). National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs. Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available. When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT *** These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974) To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities. With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden. These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations. These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles. 
The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group. In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. Crude and Products group Mid-marketing Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett. Origination In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. Trading Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas. Shipping Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line. Weather The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline. Coal Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia. Enron Japan The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities. LNG LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities. Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region. Enron Freight Markets EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products. Global Risk Markets David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup. Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance. In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk. Financial Trading Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business. In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron. I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.

We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market. To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer. Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions. 
It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors. Now it's time to look forward. With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

Dear Enron Employees: I am saddened to inform you that there was an explosion and fire at our Teesside power facility in England at approximately 2:40 p.m. local time.  At this point, we know that two employees have died, and at least two others have been seriously injured. The area has been evacuated and the power station is currently off-line.  The cause of the incident is not yet known. Our hearts and deepest sympathies go out to the families of those affected by this terrible incident.

Treatment 
Management and employees both have roles in meeting Enron's commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and Harassment Prevention.  To achieve Enron's vision, we need to recruit, select, retain, and manage the most talented people effectively.  We expect all employees to demonstrate Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.  Our efforts to achieve equal employment, and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive, inventive, and competitive as possible in a world of changes. Enron is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer.  In choosing to do business with federal, state, and city government agencies, Enron implements affirmative action plans (AAP) to recruit, retain, and promote women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and covered veterans.  Our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices, individual qualifications and merit.  Employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace, including recruitment, applicant screening, hiring, training, assignments, compensation, benefits, job performance evaluation, disciplinary action, separation, and the like.  There is no place at Enron for management practices that include bias, favoritism, discrimination, harassment, or conduct that otherwise violates the law or Company policy. Enron's Harassment Prevention Policy was developed to prevent harassment and help all employees to maintain a productive and mutually rewarding work relationship.  Harassment of any type, including sexual harassment, is contrary to our policy and preventable with education and respectful personal behavior.  We want all employees to know what harassment is, how to prevent it and how to report it.  Our policy outlines these unacceptable behaviors and helps employees better understand work-related expectations and steps.  Every employee at Enron is expected to prevent harassment and report it if it happens. Enron's Fair Treatment Policy was developed to provide and maintain a work environment in which all employees are treated equitably.  Our goal is to resolve employment disputes promptly, informally and (where possible) at the lowest level.  Employees who believe they are treated unfairly are encouraged to discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor.  When a concern of unfair, unlawful or unsafe treatment is raised, it will be investigated thoroughly and promptly.  An effective resolution will be reached based on all the information.  The Company will take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality, but must act on assertions indicating that a violation of policy or law has occurred. Each of these policies is available for review at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Please familiarize yourself with these policies.  Enron expects and encourages every worker to report workplace issues of concern.  If you need to speak with anyone someone regarding these policies or if an incident occurs that concerns you, please talk with your supervisor, contact your Human Resources representative, or call Enron's Office of Labor and Employment Relations Department at 713-853-7573.  Management is expected to ensure retaliation does not occur.  In addition, Cindy Olson, as  is Enron's EEO officer.  As and  Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations, Cindy has the responsibility, authority, and full support of Enron to ensure that all employees can avail themselves of our policies. Your support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment.  In turn, such personal and organizational success adds to Enron's business success. 
An old scam has surfaced recently with renewed vigor.  The Nigerian-419 fraud letter, so called because it violates section 419 of Nigerian law, is sent in many variations, by surface and airmail as well as by fax and email.  Generally the form it takes is to ask the unsuspecting victim to provide their bank account information in return for a promise to deposit a very large sum of money into that account under some pretext. Employees should be advised that any information given will be used to further promote the scam through the emptying out of bank accounts, counterfeit and forged checks being written against the accounts, and for other illegal purposes. If you receive what you believe to be one of these letters, forward it to Mike Hicks (Michael.Hicks@enron.com).  Corporate Security maintains a file on them, and works with the US Secret Service to reduce the number of letters received by our employees. 
Enron is proud to be a part of CowParade Houston 2001.  This exciting public art event is designed to promote the arts and benefit the Building for Children capital campaign at Texas Children's Hospital and the Texas Children's Cancer Center. CowParade Houston 2001 will feature over 300 cow sculptures, which will be transformed into magnificent works of art and displayed all over Houston, September 6 through November 7.  Sotheby's will conduct the live auction on December 6, 2001 at the Wortham Theater Center in downtown Houston. 
Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

You are invited to an Office Safety meeting on Tuesday, September 25 , 2001 from 10:00am to 11:30 a.m in EB5C2. I am hoping that everyone can attend, as office safety is a priority. Paul Duplachan will be the presenter. See you there! 
As you know, safety is the top priority for ETS. Therefore, when we see incident levels rising in any area involving our employees, company property, the public, or public property, it receives an immediate focus and plan of action. This is the case with the increasing number of vehicle accidents occurring across the ETS operating system. Here are the facts ?		To date, there have been 35 Vehicle Accidents experienced during 2001; this number has more than doubled the number reported for the entire year 2000. ?		Seventeen of the 35 Vehicle Accidents this year involved employees backing up and could have been prevented. ? ?		Seven of these 35 Vehicle Accidents involved an employee striking a fixed object, each of which also could have been prevented. ? ?	This means that 68% of the Vehicle Accidents this year have been preventable. Driver awareness training and continued communications have not had a profound effect on decreasing the number of preventable accidents. ? ?	Action Plan ? ?	In an effort to decrease the number of preventable accidents, effective immediately: ? ?		All vehicle operators are required to use the ""backing-in"" policy when parking, AND conduct a ""Safety Circle Walk"" when leaving a parking space. The only exception would be when ""backing-in"" causes a greater safety concern. Each Operations Team is accountable to see that every team member meets these two requirements. ? ?		Each employee involved in a Preventable Vehicle Accident will be required to personally review the details of the accident with the Operation's Regional Director and provide an overview of safe driving techniques at the next Team Safety Meeting. ? ?		Common based objectives for all ETS personnel are being immediately adjusted to include a ""Safe Driving"" component. Preventable accidents may impact the team's performance evaluation and could result in disciplinary action being enforced on the team and/or individual employee. This Action Plan is designed to eliminate the rising number of motor vehicle collisions. It is not put into place to create a burden on anyone, but rather to ensure that all work is performed safely. Please join me in getting behind this initiative to raise awareness that the safe operation of every vehicle is required and that each employee is responsible for his or her decisions when behind the wheel. 
Join Dave Neubauer, Vice President of Business Development and Marketing for ETS, on Wednesday, August 29, at 10:00 am Houston time for an ETS eSpeak. Dave will be discussing Northern Natural Gas' south end strategy and north end Project Max. 
Thank you for your commitment to the United Way. By raising $301,386, ETS reached a milestone in contributions.  We also set a record for participation, with 94.8% of our employees giving generously to the United Way. Congratulations to our Make a Difference contributors Sheila Nacey, Mark Adleman and Amy Krone for winning Dinner for Two at Cafe Annie.  Each of these winners will receive a $200 Cafe Annie gift certificate. Again, thank you for supporting the United Way and for believing that ETS can make a difference right here in our community. 
To date, ETS has raised $297,940.00, which is 86% of our goal of $346,000.  If you've given to the United Way, THANK YOU for your contribution. If you haven't made your contribution to the United Way, please log on to home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com> today.  Today is your last chance to make your United Way pledge. Every employee who makes or who has made a contribution at the Make a Difference level will be eligible for a drawing to receive one of three Dinner for Two Gift Certificates from Caf? Annie valued at $200.00 each.  The drawing will be held at 8:30 am, Thursday, August 23 and the three lucky winners will be notified by 10:00 am. To make a contribution at the Make a Difference level, employees with a base salary of $90,000 or below contribute .06% of their base salary.  Employees with a base salary greater than $90,000 contribute 1.2% of their base salary. Thank you for your generosity and for working with the United Way to change lives right here in our community. 
Please join Dave Neubauer on Wednesday, August 29, at 10:00 am Houston time for an ETS eSpeak. Dave, Vice President of Business Development and Marketing for ETS will host an open discussion on Northern Natural Gas' south end strategy and north end Project Max. 
Thank you, ETS! Friday's United Way Appreciation Lunch was great fun.  Team ETS, Lisa Sawyer, Rod Hayslett, Colleen Raker, Brad Holmes, John Millar, John Keller, Marcello Minotti, and Pam Daily, made us proud. On top of being named Enron's Champion Lego Builder, ETS was also awarded Most Ambitious.  The picture in the link below captures our awesome team and our winning structure. Now let's show the rest of the organization that ETS employees are as generous as we are innovative, bold and talented. At Friday's lunch, I challenged the other business units to raise more money for United Way and to have a greater participation rate than ETS.  We can't let this happen because I don't want to bake cookies for Mark Frevert! To date, ETS has raised more than $214,000, which is about 62% of our total goal of $346,000.  That's the good news. The bad news is our participation rate is less than 50%.  I know we can achieve 100% participation. If you've given to the United Way, THANK YOU.  Your contribution makes a difference right here in our community. If you haven't made your contribution, you still have time.  Please log on to <http://cr.enron.com> today to make your contribution.  You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution. If you don't have your GIS number or need assistance with keying in your contribution, please call Gina Taylor (x37681) or Sarah Haden (x53383). Please remember that contributions made last year don't automatically roll over to this year.  You'll need to enter your 2002 contribution on-line. Your contribution to the United Way has an impact on one out of every two lives in the Houston community. Don't miss the opportunity to help Houston build its future. Stan Link to see Team ETS and our winning Lego structure 
Today, at Antioch Park, we'll thank all of our employees for a great Week of Caring and a great start to a successful United Way Campaign.  I hope you are planning to attend.

The winning Lego structure will be determined by the amount of applause/noise each team gets.  With your help, we're a shoe-in for first place! I hope you'll join Team ETS and me today.  The Lego contest begins at 11:00 a.m. and judging is scheduled for noon.  We'll need LOUD support during the judging!  Free lunch from Chidk-Fil-A will be served from 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. I look forward to seeing ETS out in full force! Stan

ETS' Day of Caring is Thursday, August 9.  To date, we have over 65 ETS volunteers - thank you!  More volunteers would ensure ETS' success. On Day of Caring, ETS will be working at the Harbach Ripley Center located at 6225 Northdale.  Transportation will be provided to and from the Enron building to the Center.  Bright yellow t-shirts are available for all of our ETS volunteers.  T-shirts can be picked up at EB1638E. Box lunches will be available for Day of Caring volunteers at the Enron building.  Morning volunteers will get their lunch when they return to the Enron building, and afternoon volunteers will get their lunch when they leave for the Harbach Ripley Center. Specifically, during the Day of Caring morning and afternoon shifts, we'll be painting, replacing baseboards, cleaning and interacting with the seniors and the children at the Center.  All of these activities are indoors. There have been several questions about whether you have to take vacation to participate in the ETS August 9 Day of Caring.  You DO NOT have to take vacation.  However, please make sure you coordinate your time out of the office during Day of Caring with your team and/or supervisor. Please sign up to volunteer for Day of Caring via the on-line link below, and indicate which shift, morning or afternoon, you prefer. Please contact Kimberly Nelson (x33580) with questions.

In correlation with this year's United Way campaign theme, ""Building Houston's Future,"" and in the true spirit of Enron, there will be a building competition among the business units at the lunch. Each business unit will form a team and build something with building blocks at the August 10 appreciation event. Rod Hayslett, Phil Lowry and I will lead Team ETS.  To form the rest of Team ETS, we thought it would be fun to have a little contest. Here's the contest:  Correctly answer all of the questions in the link below by Wednesday, August 1, at 5pm, and your name will be entered into a drawing.  NO late entries will be accepted. We'll draw 7 names from the entries received and if your name is drawn, you will be an official member of Team ETS and help build the most incredible structure imaginable with me, Rod and Phil.  We'll announce the lucky winners on Thursday, August 2. At the August 10 celebration, all of the business unit building block structures will be built and judged based on Enron's attributes - smart, innovative, bold, ambitious, and united.  Ken Lay will host the Applause Meter and the business unit with the greatest amount of applause will win.  We need all of our ETS employees outside cheering on Team ETS.  Free lunch is included in the deal as well. Let's have some fun with this!  With your help, Enron and United Way will be successful at Building Houston's Future. Good Luck!

eProcurement Today marks the launch of the iBuyit eProcurement tool within Enron Transportation Services.  While many employees are using eProcurement through the B2B procurement tool, starting today, employees throughout ETS should utilize the iBuyit eProcurement tool to purchase O&M expense materials, office supplies, IT hardware and both fleet and capital work order material. Using iBuyit is a milestone in the Enron-wide cost saving effort.  This new tool will enable us to monitor and analyze our expenses and enhance our value with preferred suppliers, as well as help us control costs more effectively. The iBuyit eProcurement tool also has the potential for unlimited growth when partnered with the ETS Procurement organization, the GSS organization and good business sense. As you use iBuyit, please provide Morris Brassfield and the iBuyit team feedback to ensure that the eProcurement tool becomes and remains a valuable and integral part of our purchasing activities. Please visit the iBuyit portal to logon to iBuyit eProcurement to access training information and materials and learn more about Enron's business-wide cost savings opportunities: <http://ibuyit.enron.com>.  To logon enter your User ID (P number) and Password (initial password is ENRON1). If assistance is needed, please contact your trainer or call the ISC Customer Care line at 713.345.4727. For general information about iBuyit or the eProcurement upgrade, please send your questions via e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>. Thanks, in advance, for using the iBuyit eProcurement tool to minimize costs. Stan 
Earlier in the month, ETS IT employees and Enron Networks employees were presented the Gold Sponsorship Award at the Texas State Wide Summer Games for Special Olympics held in Arlington. Enron employees were given this award for their donation of time, as well as their ongoing support of the Guardian System and Special Olympics. The Guardian System, originally created by EDS and now supported by Enron employees, keeps scoring information and medical records, and other information on the athletes and the games. The system is now being used in other states besides Texas and is being considered for possible future use in the upcoming Special Olympics World Games. ETS IT employees Matthew Parchem, Ahmad Mousselli, Mike Dervin and James Regan provide technical expertise for the Guardian System, while walking with the project leader, Roger Fernandez of Enron Networks. Karon O'Gorman, also an ETS IT employee, works with vendors to gather donations for computer equipment to be used during the games and coordinates safe and timely delivery of the equipment.

We continue our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award. This week, please join me in congratulating: Bob Martinez Johnny McGee Corrine Miller Jim Nelson Bob, director of non-IT development in Houston, is a highly revered person. He goes above and beyond the call of duty to treat others with respect at work and outside of work. Bob is well respected by his teammates and coworkers.

He shows that we can be more than we are if only we believe and trust our business sense. While setting goals, he wants you to succeed and is an encourager. Johnny is the type of person who thinks it is better to be well done than well said.

""Bob"" Johnson Rich Jolly Hasan Kedwaii Greg Lewis Teb Lokey Bob, senior facilities planner in Omaha, demonstrates a zeal for excellence in his work and in his desire to meet customers' needs. Bob's efforts towards revenue management goals, expansion projects, and development of new tools are direct contributions to Enron's goals. Rich, regional director for Transwestern in Albuquerque, doesn't demand respect, but earns it by deeply caring for all those who work under him. Many times he may be required in the field at 7:00am and may have to drive 3-4 hours to get to the location, but he is always there. He believes in open communications and never holds back information unless it is confidential. Rich doesn't point out anyone's faults, but suggests ways to improve, then assures all the resources are there to make the improvement. Hasan, manager of IT development in Houston, is always honest and sincere in letting customers know what can and cannot be accomplished by his group. He does not promise what cannot be delivered.

Again, please join me in congratulating Bob, Rich, Greg, Hasan and Teb. 
Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me to imagine the ETS organization without Mike. Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role. To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to the Chairman and will continue to report to me. 
Once again, we continue our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award. Please join me in congratulating: Julie Cobb Jackie Griffith Rod Hayslett Arnold Hill Steve January Julie, a senior tax and audit specialist in Omaha, offers insightful perspectives and helps employees see the bigger picture of reasons behind an occurrence. She speaks openly and strives to provide balanced views on an issue. Jackie, a transportation administrator in Omaha, is polite, respectful and professional when dealing with both customers and internal employees. She is often the first contact many customers have when they are getting acquainted with Northern Border. She received her 25 year service award in the year 2000. Rod, managing director and chief financial officer, Houston, has a great capacity for listening and has an open and relaxed manner creating an atmosphere where people are encouraged to suggest new ideas. He is helpful in exploring new ideas, listening attentively and providing constructive comments. He makes his employees feel like an important member of the team. Arnold, a division technical specialist in Glasgow, MT, was a key player in establishing a professional rapport with the station site contractors personnel, inspectors, vendor representatives and engineering staffs throughout the course of the Northern Border Chicago Project . Arnold identified many items requiring change at the first station being constructed to facilitate ease of maintenance that were incorporated into the design of subsequent stations. Steve, senior director of gas control in Houston, treats all employees with respect and fairness. While listening to all thoughts and ideas, Steve enables employees to be the best they can be. Again, congratulations Julie, Jackie, Rod, Arnold and Steve. 
It is a special pleasure to announce that Steve January has been promoted to Senior Director, effective immediately. Steve's promotion is well-earned recognition of his significant impact on Gas Control, Market Services and ETS.  His 28 years of operations, pipeline dispatch and scheduling experience, as well as his credibility with our customers and other ETS and Enron business units influenced the ETS Management Committee's decision to promote him. 
Continuing our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award, please join me in congratulating: Morris Brassfield Rick Brown Bob Burleson Gary Choquette Morris, senior director of supply management in Houston, is responsible for 60-plus employees in a ten state area. During his employment, Morris has been required to close, move and establish field offices throughout the United States. He has also been involved in reorganizing and developing new ETS business units. Morris is an important leader in ETS. Rick, a construction coordinator in Amarillo, was instrumental in the Kansas A-line abandonment project. He made sure affected landowners and the construction contractor were treated fairly. In one instance, he traveled several hundred miles to have a face-to-face discussion with a group of landowners to ensure that the project would be completed without adverse environmental impact. Rick's effort diffused a potentially large and expensive problem. Bob, an account director in Houston, explains complex transactions and details about ecosystems with great ease. His prudent, careful and adept professional customer dealings are among the best. Bob is a true asset to Enron's customers and employees. Gary, an engineering specialist in Omaha, is always looking for a more efficient way of doing work. He has the initiative to drive change in the work process. Often times this requires the software development of new tools. Gary is dedicated in problem solving and working on a consensus for a solution. Again, congratulations to Morris, Rick, Bob and Gary.

For the first time in our state's history, 5 percent of Texas households will have this golden opportunity.  The NewPower Company (NewPower), which is approximately 45 percent owned by Enron, was recently formed to provide energy and energy-related services to residential customers in deregulating energy markets across America, including Texas.  For a limited time, Houston-based employees will be eligible to participate in NewPower's pilot program offering their deregulated electric service. Be Among the First to Participate: Enrollment with NewPower begins March 12.  Also, watch for a special Enron Employees Exclusive offer on your desk March 12.

In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group. 
As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery. Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free. If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward. First, let's take a look at the survey results. In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation. I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were: 1.	Stock price 2.	The PRC 3.	Employee/internal morale 4.	External reputation and image 5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect _________________________________________________________________________________________ II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. % of employees responding strongly agree/agree: I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1% Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1% I am treated with respect.	60.0% I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1% I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7% Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5% My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6% Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6% _________________________________________________________________________________________ III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000. More	Same	Less	N/A Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3% Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9% Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0% Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8% Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2% Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2% Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0% _________________________________________________________________________________________ IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron. 1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect): ---	talented ---	creative ---     learn from one another 2.	Culture and reputation: ---	innovative spirit ---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks ---   ability to embrace change ---   involvement in community 3.	Work environment: ---	pay and benefits ---   true meritocracy ---   unlimited opportunities _________________________________________________________________________________________ The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback. Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback. STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include: ---	A decline in the overall market and economy; ---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover; ---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high; ---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and ---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation. These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve. ---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses. ---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money. We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward: ---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions. --- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events. THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone. Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end: ---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently. ---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end. ---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year. ---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes. In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end. EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep. ---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days. Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles. ---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people. ---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions. EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed: ---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers. --- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October. INTEGRITY & RESPECT I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree. ---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers. ---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson. ---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results. 
This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South. Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6. We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that: ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING. Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas. We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

ETS is developing a web-based Emergency Response Information (ERI) system to provide access to employee contact information including work phone, home phone, cell phone, fax number and pager numbers. To facilitate and manage the collection of personal contact data, a new field has been added to eHRonline. Beginning Monday, October 1, all ETS employees will be prompted to either ACCEPT or DECLINE publication of personal data (i.e., home phone number) when first entering the eHRonline system. All ETS employees should access the eHRonline system at their first opportunity to respond to this new request. While certain positions within ETS mandate disclosure of personal contact data (i.e., home phone number) for emergency response purposes, in other cases disclosure of this information is at the discretion of the employees. If you are an ETS Operations employee and do not want your home phone number published, please contact your Director prior to electing not to publish your personal contact information.

I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel. Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant. Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties. 
Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity! This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo. The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community. 
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel. The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules. We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication. The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication. Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001 DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350 This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach. Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.
