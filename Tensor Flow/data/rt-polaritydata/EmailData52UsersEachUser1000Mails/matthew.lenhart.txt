we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle. 
Matt I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records. Thanks

Derek- Here is the notice that was sent out by PG&E on Friday.  This notice would not allow cycle 4 gas to flow. 
we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle. 
Matt I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records. Thanks 
i will be in town fri afternoon.  tell max and  i  will see you guys either

i know who that is.  wasn't she a cheerleader?  how have you been?  i haven't heard from you in a while.  i will try to meet up with you guys tonight. 
yeah, i will.  she is great.  she thinks i am smart b/c i read the comics. 
you are right.  you are one of a kind.  i am lucky to have you.  you are buying some time past 50.  you just added another year or two (depends if i 
it is not going to happen.  if i get hair on my back i will get it surgically 
yeah i need to get you a boob job.  i like DD.  work out your lower back b/c 
tigers play at 6.  i think we are going to go to two rows to catch the game 
well you are gonna have to work out for 2 hours a day.  i want you to stay in 
i can't wait for the cruise.  i will watch out for the hot women on the boat.  i might just stay in grand caymen and run a boat business if it is really nice there.  i want to go to denver over labor day weekend.  if you guys go up for the inagural it would be the following weekend.  memorial day would give me an extra day off. if you guys cannot stay through that weekend i will try to go over the 18th.  i will try to call tonight or tomorrow. 
that is the saddest story i ever heard.  my security guard girlfriend work at night as a tow truck lady and she probably got pissed when she saw me hanging out with you guys and towed your car.  actually i don't think the game is going to play until 8:30.  here are your tasks for next week while i am out of town: 1. plan your party 2. get music 3. get food 4. get booze 5. invite some people 6.  let me know what i owe you sounds good.  if the game comes on at 6 and we go to two rows i will let you 
i will only say it is our party if it is fun.  if it sucks it is all you. i am not going out tonight.  game is on at 8:30 and i will just watch it at home.  i need my beauty sleep before the cruise.  my security guard girlfriend doesn't have an email address (she doesn't have a computer), but she does have an instant message pager.  you should try to buy some new cd's

austin was great.  i love that place.  country grammar is a good song huh? 
it was good to see you too.  we should have partied some more.  it is tough to stay in denver for too long now b/c of work.  i think that website is classmates.com.  i am not sure b/c some girl here was on the website and that is where i saw dana's personal ad.  i was so funny b/c lisa wimbush said "" i am 24 and engaged""  and dana said "" i am 24 and single"".  everyone at work was laughing.  i hope you are having fun in san fransico.  keep in touch. 
sorry i didn't call back last night.  i didn't get back until 10.  i will try 
We've never used the CEMS data, so I don't know anything about its level of accuracy. As far as use of the WSCC data goes, I noticed that you've got table entries and are showing '0' values for a  lot of plants that have never reported reliably, such as Hermiston, Gadsby, Priest Rapids, Wanapum, etc.-- I'd leave those out until we see some plausible data reported. Also, we don't use data from plants where better numbers are available from other sources, e.g. most Pacific Northwest federal hydro. Also, are you doing anything to filter out bad hours? There are intermittent periods where series of zeros or series of identical readings are erroneously reported due to telemetry failures. If you're computing totals or averages from the WSCC data that are consistently smaller than known, accurate reports, then this might be the cause. Tim Matthew Lenhart 07/05/2000 01:59 PM

LSU Is Ranked Party School Champ Distinction Disappoints University  Officials BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of the nation's top colleges. Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas ""won"" third place. Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other university. The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity. Brigham Young University was dubbed the top ""Stone Cold  Sober"" school in the review. The top 20 ""Party Schools,"" according to the Princeton Review: 1.  Louisiana State University 2. University of Alabama 3. University of  Texas 4. Florida State University 5. University of Colorado 6.  University of Tennessee 7. University of California at Santa Cruz 8.  Tulane University 9.

i am emailing about the football pool.  bryan hull told me to give you an email and you could sign me up.  just let me know what i need to do. 
Hey there, just an update on where we stand.?  We are up to 33 people that have responded that they are in with a few more that  I definitely expect in by the time games start.? Only 8 have signed in but  there is still time to get on the site.? I wouldn't wait till the last  second incase there are problems.? Let me know if you can't figure anything  out and I will try to help. ? Just a few side notes...1)? Applebaum, we are  going to have to work on that name you signed in with...2) Susan, I will send  you a seperate email in the next couple of days with some help on getting on  line. ? Anyway, don't forget to get more players.? BUT  DON'T FORGET TO HAVE THEM REFERENCE YOU!!!? I am receiving emails from  people I can't reference and it just takes a little work to figure out who they  are.? We have got all of them cleared up except for one that I am still  working on.? It just makes it alot easier if they mention you from the  begining. ? Well, that is it for now.? Will get back to  you towards the middle of next week with some more updates. ? Brook 
Wow, what a response we have had so far...23  players are in (old news, more than that now).? WE NEED MORE  HOWEVER!!!!? Don't forget to spread the word if anyone you know would be  interested.? I surely expect atleast 10 more to join but would love alot  more.? Anyway, now to the important stuff...getting on the  site. ? Unlike in years past, I feel that people are more  internet literate and can get signed up in a league without step by step  instructions.? So I am going to give you the basics and you can figure it  out from there.? I advise you do it sooner than later incase you have any  problems. ? The site is www.commissioner.com.? On the home  page, you will see the?a place to sign into commissioner.? You must  have an account with commission.com to join the league.? It is the same  site we used last year and your name and password should still be active.?  If you don't remember it, you can create a new one or there is probably  somewhere that you can get them to email you your?username and  password.? Anyway, once you set up an account scroll down and select Office  Pool Manager. Our league name is Losers Wanted.? We also have a short name  of Loser (they might ask for that also, **notice no 's').? The password is  3333. ? You should be taken to a page to pick who you  are.? Your name should not be in the list.? Select ""new player"" and  enter your name.? This should take you to the site. ? Once you are in....BOOKMARK IT.? It will make  it alot easier to get to it in the future.? Take a look at the site.?  The three main links you will be using are...1)Make Picks...2)My  Picks...3)Standings.? Each week (I think Tuesday) commissioner.com will  enter the lines on the Make Picks page.? These lines will stay constant  untill they close the entries for the week (1 hour before first kick?off,  includes Thursday games).? You can make your picks and change your picks on  this page.? To view your picks you can go to My Picks.? On Monday you  can check the Standings.? You can view it by a certain week or the yearly  totals.? Just click on the top on what column you will want to sort  by.? That is basically it.?There are other links if you want to check  them out...it is a great site. ? As for the rules...the money will all be determined  as I get an exact number of players...ALL MONEY WILL BE PAID OUT!!!!! There will  be weekly winners and yearly winners (and LOSER).? The picks you make each  week will be each game that week, including Monday nights game.? In  addition to Monday's game, you will pick the Monday night total points  scored.? This tie breaker will determine weekly winners in case of any  ties.? The person closest to the total will win the tie breaker (absolute  value).? If the absolute value is equal, the under will beat the  over.? Example...total points is 30.? Player A picks 35...B picks  20...A wins.? Player A pick 35...B picks 25...B wins.? Don't worry, it  is real easy.? ? As for the tie breaker for the season totals.?  Anyone that is tied at the top will use the playoffs in the NFL as our  playoffs.? I will send out the lines (the site won't have them) to the  players involved.? You will pick all four games and the person who gets the  most correct will win.? If multiple people tie then we will weed out and go  on to the next weeks.? If it makes it all the way to the superbowl, then we  will pick the game and an over/under as the ultimate tiebreaker. ? Don't worry if you don't make your picks one  week.? You won't take a zero?( I am a softie).? Too many people  have those weeks that they can't get around to making there picks.? If I  gave zeros, that would kill your chances for the yearly total.? Anyone that  doesn't get their picks in will take all the AWAY teams.? I will enter  those picks after the deadline to enter picks.? All these games will count  to the yearly total but can not win the weekly prize.? ? That is it for now...Oh ya, one more thing.?  You can send me a check ($50) to the following.? ? Michael Brookner 3001 Hillcroft #508 Houston, TX 77057 ? ? PLEASE DON'T FORWARD THIS TO NEW  PLAYERS.??I WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE THAT IS IN.? IF YOU KNOW  SOMEONE THAT IS INTERESTED, HAVE THEM EMAIL ME AT BROOK@PDQ.NET.? I WILL SEND ALL THIS INFO  TO THEM WHEN I GET THERE INTEREST. ? ? THANKS....Brook

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you would have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it) If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it) A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life I want to be a pig) (How'd they figure this out, and why?) Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. (Still can't get over that pig thing) (Don't try this at home...maybe at work?) Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.  (Is that why Flipper was always smiling?) (And pigs get 30-minute orgasms? Doesn't seem fair) The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue. (Hmmmmmmmmm........) Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people do. (If you're ambidextrous do you split the difference?) The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30 times its own weight and always falls over on its right side when intoxicated. (From drinking little bottles of...?) (Did taxpayers pay for this research??) Polar bears are left handed. (Who knew....? Who cares? How'd they find out, did they ask them?) The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds. (What can be so tasty on the bottom of the pond?) The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a human jumping the length of a football field. (30 minutes...can you imagine?? And why pigs?) A cockroach will live nine days without it's head, before it starves to death. (Creepy) The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off. (Honey, I'm home. What the....) (Well, at least pigs get a break there...) Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (In my next life I still want to be a pig ... quality over quantity) Butterflies taste with their feet. (Oh, Geez)  (That's almost as bad as catfish) An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain. (I know some people like that.) Starfish don't have brains. (I know some people like that too.) After reading all these, all I can say is............. Lucky Pigs... 
Toni- Here is the resume I left you a message about.  Get back to me when you get a chance. Thank you, Matt Lenhart 
you must be on this ""best conference"" kick b/c your team lost.  sec had a down year by their standards, but that isn't the point.  lsu beat a good georgia tech team to win the peach bowl.  texas lost to a pac-10 team.  i don't need to pump up the lsu's conference b/c we won our bowl game.  i will pay you, but it is pretty sad that you are cheering for an arch rival that 
Hey guys and gals, just a reminder that we  are?less than a week away from kickoff and I see that you have not joined  in the office pool.? By now you should have received the directions on how  to join the pool.? There is still plenty of time but I still advise not to  wait to long just incase you have any problems. ? We are at over 40 players as long as each of you  join up.? Let me know if you have changed your mind so I can take you off  my list (at least for this year). ? Hope all is going well and I'll look for you on the  page. ? Brook 
this is a league where you pick all 16 games on the spread each week and if 
looks like the flight will depart,  but they cannot give me info until 
this guy is a regular carl lewis 
lsu owns texas.  did we not beat you at basketball and baseball in their most important collegiate tournaments?  why does everyone from ut think they have such a storied program?  you haven't won in decades.  your current coach has proved he can't win big games.  you guys will be ranked high (as you were this year), but you won't hold that ranking.  texas has the easiest schedule and they will manage to lose an early one as usual.  all i heard last year at this time was that 2000 was supposed to be the year, but look how that turned out.  you guys should be a little more competitive next year against ou. 
i get back monday night.  we can get a drink next week.  that actually works 
i haven't found out about my test yet.  i am pretty sure i failed.  i didn't 
i called her and she still isn't there.  i wonder if she still has a job 
she still works here.  she is probably on vacation or something.  i am sure 
i am going to denver tomorrow.  i am excited to get home for a couple of days.  how did you know i went to the black swan?  i saw some girl who was at 
i had manning but i traded him away b/c i had no backs.  now i have vodka 
did you talk to max?  what night should we go out?  if we only go out 1 night 
csu is the underdog and i would bet that they get punished.  tell max to stay 
thanks for the email.  i am hopefully taking off tomorrow night, but i am not sure b/c  i am flying united.  it will be good to be home for a few days. vegas was fun.  i went for a bachelor party.  some of my friends are starting to fall.  i hope billie's mom is okay.  i will talk to you soon. 
i have that work trip on oct. 21st.  is there another weekend that you could 
Enjoy.... - salsshort.mpg 
we couldn't get in.  the line wasn't moving so we went to the hub.  i tried to call your cell phone and leave a message.  i got your message late last night about the movie.  my cell phone was upstairs and i couldn't hear it

what is going on?  i don't think we need your tickets.  if you want me to try to sell them there i will.  how was labor day weekend for you?  what did you 
can you send down your rockies forecast again?  i need to look at your numbers for the winter again. thanks 
that game was great.  i was so impressed with griese & gary & the whole office.  the defense is a major concern.  i am torn between being impressed with what they did on the road in a hostile environment or being freaked out b/c of that defense.  st. louis had a good defense last year.  i hope their

Mr. Skilling- Here are a few questions I would like to submit before your floor meeting on the 32nd floor  Wednesday. 1.)  Enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in new markets.  Is Enron going to be just a trading company? 2.)  If Enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite volatile.  How could this affect our stock price?  Will Wall Street be prepared to accept more volatile earnings? 3.)  Volume on EOL seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and new platforms are being introduced into the market place.  Is this going to have a negative effect on Enron's stock price? 4.) What are some of the new markets Enron plans to explore in the near future? 5.)  Is Broadband coming along as quickly as Wall St. expects and how much of our stock price is based on broadband? I hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to discuss and I look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow. Sincerely, 
tonight?  i am going to a basketball game.  i heard people go out and trick

that is the saddest response i have heard.  teachers should be continually tested.  i had some idiot teachers that should have been fired b/c of their incompetence.  you shouldn't be scared to be tested if you are good at your job and half way competent.  democrats are so lazy.  how could you vote democrat?  al gore makes me sick.  enough of my ranting and raving.  what are you doing this weekend?  i am tired today b/c i went out last night.  this is a good scene.  probably not as good as miami but there is a lot going on now and our downtown is booming.    name some small towns that are cool to live in near south florida.  i heard naples is great.  i need to live on the

Dear Phillip Allen and Matthew Lenhart: As you know, I am Matthew Lenhart's PRC representative. As such, I would like to meet with each of you (separately or together) to discuss the year end PRC process, and Matthew Lenhart's activities during the second half of the year. It is extremely important that we meet prior to year end so that I can make sure I can adequately represent  your interests in the PRC. Therefore, at your convenience, please contact my assistant, Shelby Malkemes (x3-9842) to set up a time for us to get together. My guess is that 45 minutes is probably sufficient, and we can arrange a follow up if needed. If you need to contact me directly before our meeting, I can be reached at x3-6173. Regards, Ben 
Mr. Jacoby- I wanted to see if we could set up a time to meet next week concerning my PRC review.  Let me know what your schedule looks like and we will try to meet when it is convenient.  Thanks for your time.

it is such a sleazy show though.  and it is cheesy.  i am not cheesy, but i do enjoy it.   i thought you had some good rumors.  the equation was helpful?  sometimes it is easier to understand if you see the numbers.  come over tonight around 730ish or after friends since you don't want to miss that 
this is kind of gross, but it is real funny.  i don't think this is your type of humor, but girls here at work thought that it was funny so hopefully you will too.

hey annie!   good to hear from you.  how is everything going?  do you have a valentine?  i have one.  it is a girl i have been seen for a few months.  you are so lucky you get to go skiing.  i wish i could hit the slopes.  i haven't skiied in over a year.  you do need a rich guy to support you in san fran. it is so expensive there.  you could just go anna nicole and get some guy who is almost dead and inherit all his cash.  you're not that type of girl though which is good.  who else lives up there.  i thought erin and her sister lived there also.  i can't remember.  keep in touch and stay warm there.

i got a room for sept.6th - sept. 9th.  it is the rainman suite at the mirage.  there are 2 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and a huge living room.  with the room we get limo service to and from the hotel.  if there are 7 of us paying it will cost roughly $225 for each of us.  that is pretty cheap.  this way we don't need to get another room.  i also reseved a room at the luxor that can sleep 4 and a suite with 1 bedroom and a living room.  this will cost us $200 per night.  tell me which one you prefer.  we also neet to make sure everyone goes b/c if someone drops out it will cost us a lot more.  merlin, the suite at the mirage wasn't available for the 13th-16th.  get back to me soon.  you can email me back or call me at 713-807-1699. 
i think i can go in that weekend.  do you want to go fri sat sun or just sat 
one room is going to have 2 queen size beds and then one will have a king size.  there is also couches in the living room and we can get rollaway beds to the room.  location is better at the mirage, but the luxor is really nice

$225 is for 3 nights.  i can cut it down to fri night and sat night and that will drop our costs to about 145/night.  if we do that we can golf sat morning and then hang by the pool and pick up sluts.  let me know if you guys

A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in front of his office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he got out, a truck passed too close and completely tore off the door on the driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell phone, dialed 911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up. Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions, the energy trading icon started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he had just picked up the day before, was now completely ruined and would never be the same, no matter what the body shop did to it. When he finally wound down from his ranting and raving, the officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. ""I can't believe how materialistic you energy traders are,"" he said.

i think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley.  i think he heads up the trading track program.  this is the best way to get into trading now.  you have to do 3 6mo. rotations in different trading support roles.  contact him and he should be able to get you more info.  hope 
it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don't know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is just good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the part about screaming ""who let the dogs out"" was quite funny.  it makes it especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out ""shut up nerd"".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was real tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as maziarz and i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decided to vacum behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i looked behind the couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at first i was pretty freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails possibly get here? but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he didn't dispose of them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured out how to use the email system again.  last week enron sent out a company wide email and our boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt pretty embarrassed for him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to the whole company a second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now he will be known as the guy who replied not once but twice to a company wide email.  well, i sure am looking foward to the next state of the union.  i know i will since i am going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip clubs. 
nope.  we talked a couple of times and tenatively planned to go out, but last time i called she didn't call back.  she sounded like she has a situation w/ 
i didn't get thrown out of a casino.  i had to leave this bar b/c they over charged us by $300 so i argued w/ the manager and he said i had to leave.  i was pissed, but i didn't get physically removed or anything.  these guys at this club tried to rip us off and i was pissed.   i didn't out do my birthday either.  we drank a lot but it was over long periods of time.  it wasn't like 
did you talk to her recently or something?  i have been out of time a lot this month.  i went to vegas this weekend and i feel like shit now.  i had fun with her, but i really didn't hear too much from her so i  just took it
