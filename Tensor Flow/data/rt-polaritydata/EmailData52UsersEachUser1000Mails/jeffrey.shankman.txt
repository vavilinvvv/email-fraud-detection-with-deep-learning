To make a long story short. Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I did the deal) on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the remaining life (now 18 years) Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day. heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50. I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it. For what its worth........

I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM. However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas. Thanks. Jeff

I am asking my assistant, Lauren to set up a video conference to discuss the support services that Enron Europe is providing and how we should move forward to make these more responsive to your needs, as well as more efficient.   We will have a number of classic ""centralized versus decentralized"" matters to resolve and I doubt if one size will fit all.  Keep in mind that we have no desire to expand our empire.  In fact, from our perspective if our non-commerical headcount got smaller it would be a great outcome.  But the way it is has been going lately, we have been adding non-commerical headcount at a record pace at the same time that each of us is trying to massively expand our commercial business. We put a freeze on non-commerical hires earlier this week while we try and assess our space limitations and plan for the 2001 budge, so this is important that we get your perspective soon on what will work for you. Global Markets has already moved some of these services under Brent Price in Houston but there are many other services which we need to consider as well such as: IT development IT infrastructure RAC Credit Risk Management Legal Accounts Payable Tax Building Services Analyst & Associate recruiting Senior recruiting Expat services Other HR PR Governmental Relations SFA relations Finance I hate to think that we will need to form a committee to work this issue, but that is a possibility.  If you have any suggestions for a process for working these issues through, please send them out to this group or bring them to our upcoming meeting. John 
Sally I would like for each trader on the nat gas benchmark to have access to the VAR reports you publish on the Executive Reports DPR.  They should have access to only this report.  Thanks for your attention. 
After last weeks volatility in the natural gas market, I think we all agreed it is imperative that the trading, risk controls, and reporting groups understand how eack group looks at risk, and how we manage the process. While our processes are generally good, in times of extreme price and/or volatility environments, we all could be more coordinated.  It is apparent now that we must get together to look at all aspects of IT resources and intraday price risk and VAR management since it seems these are not now, but should be the same thing.  I would like to set up a meeting regarding these and other management issues and will be in touch.  I appreciate everyone's help. 
The Aquila issue has been largely addressed: the killed deals have been primarly due to one trader there-Par O'Kane, and I've spoken with him on this. I think this will resolve the problem. The Kock issue seems to be a hardware issue on their side, and I spoke with the head of IT/b to b there and she assured me they are trying to resolve this issue.  I offered one of our tech guys to visit their shop.  Jeff Enron North America Corp.

FYI....Jeff 
You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us. Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF. We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal. We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed with or without this specific turbine. Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects. However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line. If Delaney has a firm ""bird in the hand"" he should take the turbine. Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want to take the turbine. My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF. Rick 
In as much as I have been one of the bigger supporters of the staff in the A/A program and the program itselt, I'm about at my ropes end with them.  How do we get control of the thing? Jeff 
Craig is coming by today to pitch a few ideas.  I'll let you know what he comes up with (or if you'd like to be present when he does, let me know and I'll get it on your calendar).  Do you have any preliminary ideas? On another note, last night was a great idea, and I think it went a long way.  Thanks for the intro to the group. Thanks Jeff David W Delainey 08/02/2000 06:15 PM 
Jeff, we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and I need to know if you want Breslau.  I would like him in a singular role and accountability so I need to plan to incorporate him or not depending on if you want him. Regards Delainey 
I think it's time to review our disaster plan with respect to trading as we enter hurrincane season.  As I understand, there is no real cohesive plan, or course of action.  We could think about the Chicago office as an evacuation site for redundant trading, etc. This issue affects all businesses, and Sally and I have been talking about this problem.  John, should I get in touch with Phillippe or do anything else? Jeff 
One thing I forgot to mention is that if we do give Mexico mid market to Craig, we need to set up the organization out of Houston, (I think).  Max has been interviewing candidates for mid market positions there, and I would like those guys to report to Craig.  Is Max with us?  Jeff 
We've launched another new hourly gas productfor July--Mon-Fri only super peak hours (1pm central time to 9pm central time) at HPL/ ship channel...

Dave, I know you want to have a meeting about the east desk as a follow up to last weeks meeting.  Do you think it would be helpful for me to have this replicated for all desks for one meeting?  Or do you want just 1 presentation, and I will manage the rest of the rollout to the other desks? Thanks.  Jeff 
Since TXU is in such a world of hurt, do we have anyone looking at their business/assets?  Maybe we could lend the Enron helping hand....Jeff

Dave, I know you want to have a meeting about the east desk as a follow up to last weeks meeting.  Do you think it would be helpful for me to have this replicated for all desks for one meeting?  Or do you want just 1 presentation, and I will manage the rest of the rollout to the other desks? Thanks.  Jeff 
Since TXU is in such a world of hurt, do we have anyone looking at their business/assets?  Maybe we could lend the Enron helping hand....Jeff 
Generation Projects Can you forward this to the appropriate person?  Thanks. Jeff 
FYI. Jeff 
My view on the discussions with Southern Co. is that it is one of several potential ways to get at some upside out of our rights at Elba Island.  It's also giving us a good indication of where the market is for gas sourced from LNG coming in to Elba.  Nothing will be committed to without considering all the alternatives at Elba and a full review within EGM and asumably ENA.  The discussions are still, in my view, exploratory. Thanks 
Before we sign ANYTHING with Southern about the Elba volumes, I'd like an update.  Also I want to make sure we aren't trading anything away at Elba that we could be talking about elsewhere.  Thanks. Jeff

Jeff/Mike, I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers. From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone number is 505/336-8400. Clay

Hi Vince, I just got off the phone with donna piazze at Wharton, (I don't know if there is a relationship with Tom at Wharton), and we were discussing there Tiger Teams.  It is a required research program, 2nd semester for MBAs, and Wharton would love to have Enron participate.  I told her there is probably some real life reasearch project we could have the students do.  She did  also mention that it is one of the best recruiting tools under development at wharton..  I gave her your number. Her number is 215 573 8394.  Please call her when you get a chance within the week. Mark, can we get christy involved?  Thanks everyone. Jeff

Dear Celeste and Kristin: I am re-sending information regarding the Wharton Entrepreneurship Conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as participate in the Expo.  We are expecting the conference to double in size with more than 1000 attendees.  In addition, we would like to emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside of the ""dot.com"" world including in large, innovative companies such as Enron.  We have already lined up some smash hit speakers including Christy Jones of Trilogy and PCOrder as well as Anita Roddick of The Body Shop.  We would be very interested to have the participation of Enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least, a participant in our career expo. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Jeff, Greg and John, Our old friend Tom Costantino is interested in coming back to Enron. It seems that his move to NYMEX either will not happen or will not happen for some time. You can contact him at home: Phone: (713) 860 8687 (h) Vince 
I'm not sure I'm going to make it to Phila because of PRC.  I will advise next week.  Also, can you tell me Paula's last name that we rode with the other day when you all took me to the airport?  Thanks. Vince J Kaminski 11/20/2000 04:34 PM

Dear Celeste and Kristin: I am re-sending information regarding the Wharton Entrepreneurship Conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as participate in the Expo.  We are expecting the conference to double in size with more than 1000 attendees.  In addition, we would like to emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside of the ""dot.com"" world including in large, innovative companies such as Enron.  We have already lined up some smash hit speakers including Christy Jones of Trilogy and PCOrder as well as Anita Roddick of The Body Shop.  We would be very interested to have the participation of Enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least, a participant in our career expo. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Cassandra Santos Co-Chair, Wharton Entrepreneurship Conference 215.732.7940 H 215.498.3243 W - Resend Enron.doc - Fundraising Packet 2000.doc

Jeff, Christ, Mark and myself are planning to visit Tom Piazze in October. I talked to Christy about Wharton and she will be calling Tom to set it up. Vince 
Hi Vince, I just got off the phone with donna piazze at Wharton, (I don't know if there is a relationship with Tom at Wharton), and we were discussing there Tiger Teams.  It is a required research program, 2nd semester for MBAs, and Wharton would love to have Enron participate.  I told her there is probably some real life reasearch project we could have the students do.  She did  also mention that it is one of the best recruiting tools under development at wharton..  I gave her your number. Her number is 215 573 8394.  Please call her when you get a chance within the week. Mark, can we get christy involved?  Thanks everyone. Jeff

Shelly, Hunter spoke with Li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in Vince's group doing modelling, etc.  This will give her the broadest experience for a first rotation.  I'm sure the other person in question, Vikas, will do very well in Hunter's group. Thanks for your help. Jeff 
We've interviewed this guy before and had no interest then, have no interest now, and won't in the future.  I think he is trying to get in the door again somehow. Thanks.  Jeff 
(See attached file: WurlitzerResume3YNMnLSBMIDVASnolicHEOTEnron.doc) 8214 Colonial Oaks Lane Spring, Texas 77379 August 1, 2000 Mr. Jeff Shankman Enron North America Houston, Texas Jshankm@enron.com Regarding: positions in natural gas trading Dear Mr. Shankman: I  am  writing to inquire about positions in natural gas trading with Enron North  America.   I  have been working with EOTT Energy Corporation for the last  four  months on a temporary basis on a project involving setting up a profit/loss  report  for  the  various regions within the United States for EOTT's  crude  oil trading and marketing business.  Previously, I worked in the  energy  industry  for  over  two  years  in  trading, risk management, structured  products  and  marketing of electricity and natural gas for the western  United  States.   Additionally,  I  was  actively  involved in the physical  markets  and  gained  a strong understanding of the western grid. Furthermore,  I am an expert in options trading and have a strong knowledge of the commodity and financial markets.  Moreover, I have also traded NYMEX natural  gas  futures,  options  on futures, forward contracts for physical power  and  options  in  SERC, SPP, MAAC, MAIN, ECAR and ERCOT.  Finally, I have  had  experience  setting  up/operating  market  simulation models and maintaining the underlying databases for fixed income securities.  Prior to entering the energy markets, I worked as the senior trader/risk manager for Mellon  Mortgage  Company  in  Houston,  Texas.   At  Mellon,  I positively affected  the  bottom  line  performance  of the company for over two years through  strategic  trading  and  hedging of mortgage backed securities.  I received the Premier Achievement Award from the Chief Executive Officer for outstanding  financial  performance  and  the  Employee  Choice  Award from co-workers for my tenacity and diligence in work.  My expertise with listed futures  and  options  on  futures,  OTC  options and swaps, as well as the ability  to  positively  affect  the  bottom  line could definitely make an impact  with  your  team.   In addition, my competitive and entrepreneurial personality  allows  me to constantly look for profitable solutions or cost effective ways of managing risk. As  you  will  note  from  the  enclosed  resume, I managed the trading and hedging  of  the  interest  rate risk on mortgage loans for Mellon Mortgage Company.   The  interest  rate risk was managed by use of forward sales and purchases  of  mortgage backed securities, put and call options on mortgage backed securities, and 10 year CMT Index floors.  In addition,  futures and options on futures on U.S. Government Treasury notes and bonds were used at the  appropriate  time  taking into account the basis between mortgages and treasuries.   Previously,   I worked for The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in  New York as a proprietary trader in fixed income. Earlier, I worked for Garvin  Guybutler  Corporation,  a  major  international  money and deposit broker.    Primary  responsibilities  at  Garvin  included  uncovering  and executing  arbitrage EuroDeposit transactions in order to enhance placement yields   and   reduce   borrowing  costs  relative  to  Eurodollar  deposit transactions  of  similar  maturities.   In addition, I was involved in the brokering   of   Term  Federal  Funds,  EuroDollar  deposits,  EuroCurrency deposits, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements. It  would be my pleasure to discuss these qualifications with you and learn more  about  positions  in  natural  gas  trading with Enron North America. Please contact me so we can talk about possible opportunities. Thank you, Rick J. Wurlitzer (281)251-6210 E-Mail: rwurlitzer@juno.com - WurlitzerResume3YNMnLSBMIDVASnolicHEOTEnron.doc

I think it's time to review our disaster plan with respect to trading as we enter hurrincane season.  As I understand, there is no real cohesive plan, or course of action.  We could think about the Chicago office as an evacuation site for redundant trading, etc. This issue affects all businesses, and Sally and I have been talking about this problem.  John, should I get in touch with Phillippe or do anything else? Jeff

I have some real concerns over this contract Louise put together for Jonathan.  Shanna, can you check this out with Robert Jones.  I'd like to restructure this contract. Jeff 
Jeff, Attached is the term sheet we put together for Jonathan Whitehead: Please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks, Robert 
I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side provided you are happy with the numbers. Louise ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers. 
As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today. Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular. If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM. This restructure will similarly align weather. Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure.

Competition in Asia Pacific Region Singapore is mentioned.  What do you think.  Jeff 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive. Maybe I don't understand it all. Bruce Lundstrom 09/25/2000 03:54 PM Sent by: Liz N Martinez 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels - At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns. Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2. Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco. The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates. The following is a summary of these competition provisions: Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk management services. There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction. ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix). ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii). It does not include Japan and Australia. The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003. Thank you, Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI 
I think that meeting with Stan was good.  I'll push Nowlan, Schroeder, etc. On another note, I want to send out an email to the business unit heads about hiring.  Obviously crucial to our business growth is more talent, I'm just worried we could be bringing in people on the trading side that do not upgrade our group.  After we feel more comfortable, and I feel good our assessment of talent, I'd loosen the reigns substantially.  This is driven by the crude and products group primarily.  Any thoughts? Jeff 
boy is she a pistol...! 
Jeff, Attached is the outline from today's meeting. If I could put in my two cents about my future boss, I'd say:  hungry director... some good gas trader who's really sharp and excellent at what he's doing, but he's never going to be king of the gas desk because there's too many crown princes, and he'd rather side-step them all and push this LNG forward with a vengence.  and if he's tired of Houston and not too much of an arrogant bastard, that's a bonus. I'm off to the pub.  These 7:30pm meetings don't do much for me.  Have a good weekend. Merritt 
I have some real concerns over this contract Louise put together for Jonathan.  Shanna, can you check this out with Robert Jones.  I'd like to restructure this contract. Jeff 
Jeff, Attached is the term sheet we put together for Jonathan Whitehead: Please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks, Robert 
I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side provided you are happy with the numbers. Louise ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers. 
As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today. Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular. If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM. This restructure will similarly align weather. Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure.

I would like to have a morning meeting in my office every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday in the same format you guys have now around 8 or 8:15.  Obviously, these days are in addition to the Monday and Wednesday meeting general meeting.  I would like to start them one week from today and at 7:30 am, unless notified otherwise. Thanks.

As we move forward with our global LNG strategy, it is obvious that the best way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this business unit.  This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position management from a worldwide perspective.  Our ability to gather data and to show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success.  As important is one pricing desk.  Many of you know, Eric Groves in Houston is running our pricing desk, Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type business for us, and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group. To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business, Mike and I wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention.  ALL LNG contacts, negotiations, and contracts, (physical, financial, buys, sales, etc.), with external counterparties must and will be managed through our commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales, and Rick Bergsieker. It is crucial to manage market perspective, appearance, and informantion.  We all know how important each project (Metgas, and other initiatives in India) could be, but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our businesses. Regards 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region Singapore is mentioned.  What do you think.  Jeff 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive. Maybe I don't understand it all. Bruce Lundstrom 09/25/2000 03:54 PM Sent by: Liz N Martinez 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels - At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns. Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2. Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).

FYI, the email i sent to Nowlan. 
John, you and I have spoken of this issue before, and I hope you understand how important this is now.  I understand about the endemic risk from J Block, etc.  but I need details on how much those portfolios add to our var. Last night you guys blew var by 3.1 million by adding 4.7 million var.  As a result, I am not prepared to go to the board and ask for more. The best way to approach this problem is by managing the var and making sure we have no violations, coming up with detailed reports indicating exposure by product and trader, etc.  While we have been working on this with Brent Price, we are not there yet. A violation like this one today after our string of many is particularly troubling, esp since we are not keeping the money made over the last two weeks.  The MTD P&L, being reported as a little over one million this month doesn't help us really. I am now going to give out specific position limits to certain traders who have had big var swings without the resultant P&L. 
I'm tired of signing Var Violation memos.  Keep your var under limits for a while and we will talk about more var.  Also we need to fininsh up reports. You need to be running the business at 7.5 million or so to give yourself some room. 
Mike and I have spent the last few weeks learning about each of your businesses, and we are convinced that EGM can be a tremendous driver in Enron's growth.  We have an opportunity to dedicate significant resources to each group, and grow them with tremendous focus.  To that end, I would like to maintain consistency and closely manage that growth as we begin this process.  Accordingly, please do not make any organizational changes, offer employment contracts, or hire/fire anyone until I approve.  Once we streamline our evaluative processes, and make any necessary organizational changes, Mike and I will take a more liberal approach to these activities. Thanks for your cooperation.

Nobody in my shop has seen any of this.  I'm not sure what Rick is doing with Skilling, and I am not in a position to respond to the outcome of their meeting.  Eric Gonzales needs this ship, or at least play the card with either British Gas or BP/Amoco for fuel to supply the spanish plant.  Eric is frustrated as well, and nobody has done any economic or commercial study on the exmar option.  I'll phone Bergsieker and see what I can find out. Thanks. Jeff 
Jeff, Two quick points: 1.  We wanted to give you a heads-up in case you weren't aware - Rick Bergsieker is planning to meet with Skilling sometime this week (believe post-Wednesday) to talk about the exercise of the first Exmar option. This option expires on September 8th, an extension from the original expiry of 31 August. Option 2 (for a third vessel - to expire 30 November) will expire along with option 1, if option 1 is not exercised. Option 1 is US$1,000/day more than the original vessel.  Option 2 is US$1,500/day more than the original vessel.  (The original vessel is US$51,850/day fixed + US$10,790 O&M escalating) As discussed earlier, Bergsieker's group is offering the use of the Hoegh Galleon (Mystic Lady) to Kogas as an incentive for them to sub-charter the second Exmar vessel from us. While we are not aware of the terms of the sub-charter agreement, we do perceive the shipping constraint in the industry to be most acute in the next 3 years, and thus not the best use of the Hoegh Galleon. We are under the impression that Bergsieker also plans to use this opportunity to discuss ""LNG Strategy and Oversight"", specifically his group's future role in it.  Please see the attached presentation to this end. 2.  We had a planning meeting with Eric today and are pushing ahead on an initial business plan to be delivered at the end of the week.  We expect to cover the following: Opportunities for Enron in this market Value - where we can extract it Assets - how best to utilise them Resource planning Goals Please let us know if there is anything further you would like included at this point, or if we can answer any questions regarding any of the above. Thanks, Merritt & Brad +44-207-783-7063

It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular. If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM. This restructure will similarly align weather. Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure. 
take a look 
As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists today. Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees in the weather business.  It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular. If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM. This restructure will similarly align weather. 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region Singapore is mentioned.  What do you think.  Jeff 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive. Maybe I don't understand it all. Bruce Lundstrom 09/25/2000 03:54 PM Sent by: Liz N Martinez 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels - At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns. Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2. Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco. The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates. The following is a summary of these competition provisions: Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk management services. There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction. ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix). ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii). It does not include Japan and Australia. The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003. Thank you, Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI 
I think that meeting with Stan was good.  I'll push Nowlan, Schroeder, etc. On another note, I want to send out an email to the business unit heads about hiring.  Obviously crucial to our business growth is more talent, I'm just worried we could be bringing in people on the trading side that do not upgrade our group.  After we feel more comfortable, and I feel good our assessment of talent, I'd loosen the reigns substantially.  This is driven by the crude and products group primarily.  Any thoughts? Jeff 
fyi 
FYI, the email i sent to Nowlan. 
John, you and I have spoken of this issue before, and I hope you understand how important this is now.  I understand about the endemic risk from J Block, etc.  but I need details on how much those portfolios add to our var. Last night you guys blew var by 3.1 million by adding 4.7 million var.  As a result, I am not prepared to go to the board and ask for more. The best way to approach this problem is by managing the var and making sure we have no violations, coming up with detailed reports indicating exposure by product and trader, etc.  While we have been working on this with Brent Price, we are not there yet. A violation like this one today after our string of many is particularly troubling, esp since we are not keeping the money made over the last two weeks.  The MTD P&L, being reported as a little over one million this month doesn't help us really. I am now going to give out specific position limits to certain traders who have had big var swings without the resultant P&L. 
I'm tired of signing Var Violation memos.  Keep your var under limits for a while and we will talk about more var.  Also we need to fininsh up reports. You need to be running the business at 7.5 million or so to give yourself some room. 
What are the developments?  Let's start talking. ""Preston Head"" <ph@admis.com> 02/14/2001 06:03 PM 
Jeff, I enjoyed visiting with you last week.  Subsequent to our meeting, I did speak at greater length with our physical and derivatives traders. There are developments which  may well provide for our examining ways to work together on OTC, risk management and clearing collectively.  How would you like to proceed?

Rick, fyi, we are contemplating signing a simple expression of interest letter with the Tampa Bay Port Authority for a potential site for an LNG Terminal to supply S. Florida markets. Our development efforts to date have not been as focussed on T.B. as they have been on the Bahamas proposal.  However, we came across a potential site in the Tampa Bay port which meets many of our criteria for a terminal site (e.g. existing deep water port, sufficient acreage adjacent to the port, industrial zoning).  We have yet to test the rationale of injecting significant quantities of gas into that market location, but the port is willing to commit to exclusivity on their part until the end of the year.  In this period of time we can easily determine if the project makes sense. I believe its a good defense against others making a similar move and we are committing to nothing and paying no dollars. Please let me know if you concur.  The draft letter is attached below (I've got legal sign-off on it already). Thanks 
Ram, Attached is the letter that we discussed. We shall expect you at 10:30on Friday. Come to the 17th floor.  From there, I will take you to the conference room. We will be meeting in 16C1. We will agree the letter and further our understanding of the layout, the option agreement and the lease terms. Dave

Draft: We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets: Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new finance origination activities.  In this role, he will work with all commodity products, assets,  and teams and lever our existing businesses with new this new focus.  (Do you want to put in his background--which you probably now more than I?)  He will be reporting to the Office of the Chairman. Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.  (Do you want to put in his background?)  Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket relationships and  industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.  Eric and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman. Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet pages exist today.  Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial interface for our intranet page.  Heather was with Azurix, where she worked on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives. Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.  This group will be comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics important to their individual markets, and discuss other  markets in a macro sense.  We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.  In this group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group will not be involved in customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.   Gary will manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, Equity, and Agriculture initiatives. (anything else?) 
I'd like to talk to him, but isn't merlin's credit low?

FYI....Jeff 
You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us. Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF. We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal. We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed with or without this specific turbine. Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects. However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line. If Delaney has a firm ""bird in the hand"" he should take the turbine. Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want to take the turbine. My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF. Rick 
any thoughts? 
The partial sale of Enron India's 100% interest in Metgas is on Cliff Baxter's list of corporate assets for sale.  As I expressed in our recent telephone conversation,  I view Metgas as a key asset that could be of great value to the EGM LNG network.  I believe that Enron should reconsider whether or not a Metgas selldown is a wise move at this time for the following reasons: 1.  The Dabhol LNG terminal is ideally located for future LNG arbitrage plays, i.e., halfway between middle east and far east LNG suppliers. Opportunites for Mideast/Far East swaps or shipping backhauls could generate significant value for EGM. 2.  Metgas currently holds exclusive rights to use Dabhol's LNG terminal for imports of LNG into India, and it will be at least several years (if ever) before a second LNG terminal is built in India.  We should not be giving this strategic position away. 3.  The fact that our competitors (e.g., Petronas, BP, BG etc.) want to buy in is an indicator that we have something of value.  Even a partial selldown (and granting of voting rights) to one of these players could serously compromise our optionality and ability to maximize value to Enron. 4. I suspect that the market value of Metgas at this time (given that there is still significant developement risk) is fairly small relative to its network value to EGM. If, in spite of my arguments, a decison is made to sell down Metgas, there are two things that we could do to limit the damage: 1.  Prior to the sale, sign an agreement between EGM and Metgas that provides EGM with exclusive rights to use the terminal, and 2.  EGM should step into the Metgas/Malaysia LNG contract (i.e., EGM should buy from Malaysia and resell to Metgas) to ensure that we maintain maximum optionality in this contract.  We could do this in a way that gives us control of the contract but passes Metgas risk through EGM and back to Malaysia. I understand that the time fuse for this selldown is very short---immediate action is needed if you want a vote on this. Rick

MKT SUMMARY Despite the fact that we have seen some cargoes offered for resale in ARA mkt for nearby delivery thru to Q1 this week the tone of the mkt remains very firm. EDFT, seemingly still unsure of it's burn schedule one week to the next had a spot cape to find a home for if he could replace with tonnage from either ourselves or the mkt for December delivery. We offered equivalent of $39 cif ARA but they chose to take her themselves and two port her into Le Havre and Montoir which shud highlight the inability to extract from the mkt anything better than $40.50-$41 cif for delivery December period. Indeed, due to rescheduling Anker Coal were offering some South African material into ARA for Nov shipment which we showed some interest in but they claim to have unloaded it at $40.75 on a cif basis. Thus the direction and structure of the ARA mkt continues to reflect what we are seeing in both the FOB origin and frt mkts - there is no incremental tonnage available out of Australia for Europe as producers look to take advantage of a soaring Pacific prices. Many were already well sold as the mkt really took off and hence are actively trying to fulfill old European contracts from elsewhere in order to free up some bullets. Certain South African producers claim to be sold out until the New Year and Drummond continues to struggle with getting their shipment schedule back on track stating that it won't be until May next year that they are fully back on track again. While there is not a huge amount of open demand thru to the end of the year anyone who finds themselves entering the spot mkt from here on in will have to dig deep into their wallets. Q1 01 still proves to be a very interesting period where on the supply side we will still be experiencing all of the above mkt factors but where there is also still a substantial amount of open demand to be satisfied. Still could see some fireworks and a steeper inverse than what we see today with Q1 01 at $41.50 fob and Jan/Dec 01 at $41.25 - watch this space. SPOT TRADES While we have worked towards procuring some spot tonnage thru various channels it has been a week without any spot business. As per above the mkt is fairly well covered for nearby tonnage and sentiment of the buyers is to remain very hand to mouth for final requirements rather than pay these high prices in advance. We are also not too aggressive at mkting what material we have unsold in stock or arriving later in the year as we are confident that the mkt will give us handsome returns as we move further into the winter months and those spot buyers are eventually forced to the table. SELLING SIDE Mission still have not covered their December requirements. Our offer of 1.46 GBP per GJ delivered Ferrybridge and 1.28 GBP FOR Hunterston were only valid until Friday but they claim to hold on offer of 1.30 delivered Ferrybridge for Polish material. We said that he shud be filling his face at that level and if we could have some aswell that wud be very kind. The sage continues! We have agreed in principle to a five year supply agreement with Stadtwerke Bremen for between 850mmt - 1mil tonnes per year starting Jan 01. Prices will be linked to the BAW Index. HEW/VW combined are tendering for 270,000mt for Q2 shipment into Hamburg. We have offered $42.50 cif. Electrabel looking for 50mmt each month 2001. EDFT continue to look for some cover for Q1 01. Veag - 300mmt cif Rostock for Nov00/Jun 01 Endesa - 4 capes for 2001. H del C was interested in spot cargo we were looking at and still working various possibilities of swapping material for 2001. While we hoped Coe Clerici may be suitable counterparty to sell us Russian coal going forward they are looking for us to sell them some sort of structure which will limit their Russian short going forward! Fenosa - 250mmt of Low Vol U.S material for 2001 but so far unable to get an offer basis this material. Innogy looking for upto 1mil tonnes for delivery throughout 2001 Bewag still have tender out for 500mmt for next year where we are looking to put a proposal to them basis Polish material. BUYING SIDE Continue to work Emerald for material out of the U.S. - hopefully persistence will pay and we may close something this week for 2001 shipments. Bot a further cargo from Masefield for Q1 shipment FOB Santa Marta at $32 basis 11800btu/lb Ensham had a lower quality coal (cape quantity) on offer at $25.30 fob Oz but unfortunately the specs make it a much more difficult prospect to find a home for. Possibility of buying some bits and pieces ex Maputo for Q1 which would equate to somewhere in the region $41 cif ara. Would be good to test viability of shipping thru this port. In tandem with 5 year agreement to supply Bremen with coal we have agreed a five year Agency Agreement with German counterparty whereby he will procure Polish coal for Enron for shipment against our Bremen obligations. NCSC - looking at feasibility of swapping or buying outright South African material for 2001. EOL What started as a fairly quiet week ended as our best and most exciting week yet. Between Thursday and Friday we did 16 trades via EOL equating to just over 300,000mt. Glencore was the main sponsor of the action on Friday, intent on driving prices higher they were a net buyer on the day and are no doubt testing our ability to act as a physical market maker and hence deliver against our commitments with no coal assets as a backstop! Life to date we have traded 950,000mt on EOL so hopefully all going well we shud surpass the 1mil mark this week. We shud be in a posn where we can roll out our options against the SECA at Coaltrans in two weeks time. GAMEPLAN Running the risk of sounding repetitive our focus must remain on securing tonnage to play with for next year. To date our Drummond long has been the only real ammunition we have and there is little security of supply out of Puerto Drummond for the first 6 months of next year. With the demand that we have on the table today we could turn our 1 mill long into a short with no problem at all.  While there will always be a level where one is happy to short a market I wud feel very uncomfortable doing so at the traded levels for 01 today despite the absolute levels being the upper end of the historic range. We still have a little way to go to actually signing contracts which secures us the 5 year deal with stadtwerke Bremen but  on the assumption we do we must start looking at our supply strategy for the first 6 months of next year where it looks to be most challenging. The business we will be fantastic for creating flows into Germany and ARA and with the guarantee that we can supply 10% of the total volume as Petcoke it will certainly act as the springboard for launching us into this tightly controlled mktplace.

Supposed to be low 70's this evening, and cool tomorrow a.m. ""Lisa A. Schiffman"" <Lisa_A._Schiffman@jonesday.com> on 10/06/2000 12:13:45 PM

Dear Jay, Here is the Jay Baker piece for our newsletter.  I like the way it turned out.  I worked on it a bit...he is so proud of its humbleness and ofcourse I love the fact that it is so understated but a few of his initial comments were a bit much.  After all this house is extraordinary quality   and as you know it is always harder and probably more expensive to create something simple and elegant. See what you think and call me or email with any changes and then we'll run them by Jay Baker. Hope you love the house. Julie - jaybaker.pdf 
I may or may not be in town, but I think Mike will be here.  It's probably important that one of us attend. Jeff Daniel Reck 10/05/2000 05:52 PM 
Can either of you make this meeting?  Its not necessary, but it would give you more insight into what's going on with this potential deal. --Dan 
Thanks for your interest.  Mike and I have looked at cement a little, so I'm interested in your perspective.  Please contact my asst.  Jennifer Burns, at ext 39440 and get on my calendar. Jeff Kenneth Booi@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/05/2000 05:35 PM 
Jeff: CALME's HR advised me that there is no match for my skills and experience in your business unit.  I spent a great part of my professional career in the oil & gas business.  Therefore, I have contacted Mike Brown to see if I can bring value to his team.  I have not gotten any response yet. As I have about three weeks left to find a position within Enron, I would like to explore/seek origination opportunities in a totally new area for Enron:  Cement.  This industry can be transformed to the new economy and given its size, it may well be a significant income generating market for us and certainly within a short time another commodity for EnronOnline. This is new for me but enormously challenging.  I am asking you to give me a chance to sell this concept to you at your convenience.  I have enclosed a brief resume for your review. I look forward to meeting with you.  Thanks, Jeff ken 
fyi....I'll set up a meeting with this guy.

jeff, have not responded to erik yet, just a sign of the times. We need to discuss what we want and can do for him. 
John, Attached note regarding contract. 
Your thoughts are dead on.  Russel would be a great guy to cover those guys for EGM for crude and products.  Please mention to Caroline we are not trying to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage.  Also, when we talk about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage.  (We can also address her issue later--I agree with you on that.)  Proceed, but I'm not sure about the JV with ENA issue.  Let's not go down that road ""officially"". By the way, rough is spelled roof. Later..... Jeff Per Sekse 02/14/2001 10:14 AM 
I know you're busy so here are my thoughts. The hedge fund business has expanded enough to warrant at least two people covering it. It makes sense that Enron has one person focussed on the natgas business since it is 90% of what we book right now. We're also about to get one of the funds trading power.  Caroline Abramo focusses on this and will continue to do so reporting to Fred. If for some reason that relationship doesn't work out, we can revisit it with her at that time. To build up the crude oil and products trading we should have a similar person devoted to covering the hedge funds. That person should work for GM and work in partnership with ENA, kind of a JV between our groups, but with the origination for each product staying with the appropriate business unit, as you plan to do.  Given that, I would recommend putting Russell Dyk in that role, have him spend the next 2 months working on the crude desk to kick start the coverage and then move him to NY. He and Caroline would share the hedge fund client base and back each other up when busy or travelling. If we need more support, we can add an associate to work for them jointly in NY. Overall, we're leveraging our hedge fund relationships to generate more origination income for Enron. This model also fits with the reality of hedge fund coverage at Enron, i.e. you need marketers with specific product knowledge close to the trading desks dealing direct with the fund traders. Enron Metals has their own people doing this today. We're simply expanding the concept to GM. Ultimately, when we get Enron under one rough in NY, the metals, oil and gas specialists woukld be able to jointly cover the clients, while providing market expertise as needed. If you agree this makes sense, then I can tell Fred that we plan to put our own person in NY. What do you think? I can stop by to discuss further any time today. Per 
If you'd like to go, that would be great.  Thanks.  Jeff Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe

sorry for the oversight on my part. 
no problem Liz M Taylor 10/05/2000 11:11 AM 
Jeff, We realize that you are no longer a direct report to Greg, however, he would like you to submit feedback on him as a ""direct report"" from the  good old ENA trading days.  READ BELOW Many Thanks, Liz 
Well, we finally got Greg Whalley enrolled in the ""Executive Impact & Influence"" seminar.  Each of you have been listed for feedback in the ""direct report"" category.  It is crucial to Greg's success in the program that all feedback to be submitted.  Don't let this opportunity pass you by! I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to make sure you are in receipt of the feedback forms. Many Thanks, Liz Taylor 
Please include Jen Fraser on this distribution as well going forward. Jeff 
Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  If you want to stay active in recruiting, let me know.  Also Michelle Nezi Marvin will be our shcool lead. Best Regards Jeff 
Thanks for the email.  I'll put some thought into it.  Stay in touch-- Jeff Edward Resovsky <resovsky@ben.dev.upenn.edu> on 10/05/2000 09:30:24 AM Please respond to resovsky@ben.dev.upenn.edu 
Mr. Jeffrey Shankman COO Enron Global Markets Houston Dear Mr. Shankman, At the suggestion of my colleagues Michael Baker & Donna Armand, I am just dropping you this email to introduce myself -- the Penn development officer who covers the world!  I am not sure I can benefit you -- although particularly in Asia I do know an awful lot of people -- perhaps as much as you can benefit me -- for the same reason. And there may be some Penn initiatives around the world -- such as the Center for the Advanced Study of India, about which you do know -- that you might like to be aware of -- a major new collaboration in the making in the Life Sciences with Singapore, for instance.... you never know when the network will help. I'd certainly welcome knowing more about what you do as well.  Totally by coincidence I am coming to Houston Sunday to see an alumna who is in poor health.  I am sorry that it is over Yom Kippur -- otherwise, I would have offered you a meal.  Perhaps we can do it another time, Philadelphia, Houston, or Hong Kong! Thanks for all you do for Penn. Ed Resovsky. -- Edward M. Resovsky Managing Director, International Operations Development & Alumni Relations University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA  19104-6285 Phone: 215-898-6633 Fax: 215-573-4281 Email: resovsky@ben.dev.upenn.edu {can receive attachments} 
It's not necessarily an either/or decision.  Michelle, do you think this is a good program?  Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze at Wharton, and ask him what he thinks about the importance of our participation in this? Jeff Kristin Gandy@ENRON 10/05/2000 08:56 AM 
Here is another conference we can participate in.  Would you rather do this conference or the entrepreneurship conference? Kristin 
Hi Kristin I am following up on our conversation earlier with respect to Enron participating in the Whartons Finance conference and the evening reception known as Bullish on Finance. I think this forum will be a great opprotunity for Enron to reach the students interested in finance and it also provides a great platform to talk about Enrons unique position in the global financial community. Please do consider the option of sponsoring a panel at the Gold level. It provides a great value and essentially a full panel ""ownership"" to talk about Enrons acitivities. I would like to touch base with you early next week to hear you thoughts and feedback on these proposals. Looking forward to a great conference participation. Kind Regards Suresh Suresh Balasubramanian MBA Class of 2001 The Wharton Business School Ph#: 215-893-9491 - finance1.con.enron.doc 
If you'd like to get me the resumes today, I'll take a look, and pick a few out.  This way we won't need to change the meeting time.  Michelle was my first choice to lead the effort.  OK about Suzanne. I'm serious about keeping a highly visible presence on campus, and am willing to spend some money, strategically.  Keep me updated. Jeff Kristin Gandy@ENRON 10/05/2000 08:41 AM 
Would you like to change the meeting to Tuesday October 10th?  The meeting would have to take place at 9am because I have a flight out of town at noon. Just let me know what you would like to do. On another note, I wanted to let you know I am removing Suzanne Farrow from the team this season.  This decision has come after her incessant quibbling with me about pettily details.  I have better things to do with my day than to banter back in forth with Suzanne, as I am sure you do as well.  Suzanne has been a problem with her continual emails from day one.  I feel we as a Wharton team have the recruiting season under control.  Also, Michelle Nezi-Marvin has agreed to be the Wharton team lead and has been very helpful with details and arrangements over the last couple of weeks.   Thank you.

Dear Jeff, Happy Valentines Day.  I was in New York this weekend for halley and Michael's Valentines day brunch.  halley mentioned that she would try to get in touch with you for me.  I received an email from her yesterday suggesting that I call you in order to arrange a trip down to Houston to meet some people at Enron.  However, I do not have your office number and have not had much luck getting it off  the internet.  I am requesting, if possible a reply containing a number at which you can be reached.  I will call you and we can then work out plans for a visit. Have a great day, Dan - dfuller.vcf 
If you think there is value to your seeing the ship, I'm ok with your detour.  Let me know before you go what you intend to find out if anything. Regards Jeff Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe

Dear Celeste and Kristin: I am re-sending information regarding the Wharton Entrepreneurship Conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as participate in the Expo.  We are expecting the conference to double in size with more than 1000 attendees.  In addition, we would like to emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside of the ""dot.com"" world including in large, innovative companies such as Enron.  We have already lined up some smash hit speakers including Christy Jones of Trilogy and PCOrder as well as Anita Roddick of The Body Shop.  We would be very interested to have the participation of Enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least, a participant in our career expo. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

somewhat surprising, but we'll take it 
In light of the forthcoming analyst presentations, the following may be of interest: We submitted an award application to AsiaRisk Magazine (A Risk magazine publication) on 15 September nominating Enron for our innovative Online weather derivatives trading in the region. We have received advice from AsiaRisk Editor, Ellen Leander, Enron has won Energy/Commodity House of the Year Award for the Asia region.  This will be published in their November issue.  We are awaiting final written confirmation beyond the email below. Paul Ellen Leander <ellen@asiarisk.com.hk> on 09/26/2000 06:47:50 PM

Jeff, I reserved a place on your calendar tomorrow to go over the Northwest Shelf bid proposal.  Attached is a brief powerpoint file describing my view on how we should think about this transaction.  I'll bring along a copy in case you don't get a chance to look at it. Thanks, Brad 
I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I presume you mean under Pierre).  However, we have to look at our internal and external options.  If you look at the structure of  the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron.  In fact it appears to be quite one-sided.  First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including Pierre and Wayne).  Second estabish internal procedure, and trading capabilities.  Third, execute.  I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward. Thanks.  Jeff Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/14/2001 06:29 AM 
Further to my voicemail yesterday, I understand through Eric that consideration is being given to collapsing the LNG shipping responsibilities into the coal group.  I believe that this would be a mistake.  Eric and I have been talking about this for some time and have defined and are implementing an organizational plan that we both believe is a good one.  I would like the opportunity to talk this through with you before you make any irreversible decisions.

FYI, these are the type deals we as a trading group really like as they give us some physical volumes so we can get into that market as well as a financial transaction to make some money. Both sides should be a winner for us.  We have worked with Chris on 2 others of these and they have failed due to the variuos reasons but primarily the way the uk tax authorities look at the structures. I will keep you posted on the progress. 
F.Y.I. We are helping Chris Harris here in London putting a structure together that can give us crude oil in the Nsea. The idea is that we will buy the crude oil from a North Sea producer to a fixed price. The duration could be for the next 4-6 years depending on how comfy we are with the exposure. By buying future oil to a fixed price at lower numbers than the future curve would suggest and paying upfront (due to time value of money), the producer will end up paying less tax. This has been tried many times before by different banks and never worked. This time Chris Harris thinks that by presenting the correct package it might pass.  We will see. However, in case of  success, we will have to do two things. 1. sell futures for the next 4-6 yrs, volume could be 25-50' bpd. 2. sell the physical bbls. Number 2 is no problem and depending on the volume I think number 1 should be OK. We might have to hedge thru WTI, but will try Brent. Question: with a deal like this do we need any signatures from above? Chris Harris will be happy to run a full presentation if required. regards chris glaas

Jeff: Just a short note to touch base on MetGas related activities. We, (the MetGas Development Team) will be meeting with the Global LNG Team (Bergsieker et.al) starting on Wednesday, October 4.  The agenda is attached for your information.  If you have any questions or would like direct feedback please let me know. When can we discuss the way forward for MetGas LNG supplies and the integrated approach among the upstream team and the MetGas team that is crucial to securing terms and conditions that fit the market?

It's the horrible virus they have been talking about in the news and unfortunately my assistant opened it so it is now automatically sent to everyone in our address books...sorry!

Competition in Asia Pacific Region 
I've already talked to Cliff B.  The only thing we are precluded from is building a power plant in Singapore... 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region Singapore is mentioned.  What do you think.  Jeff 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive. Maybe I don't understand it all. Bruce Lundstrom 09/25/2000 03:54 PM Sent by: Liz N Martinez 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels - At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns. Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2. Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco. The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates. The following is a summary of these competition provisions: Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk management services. There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction. ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix). ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii). It does not include Japan and Australia. The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003. Thank you, Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI 
Very strong need for people in Japan next august.  I'd like to get some people interested in helping start there, or get there after some enron indoctrination.  Thanks.  Jeff 
Yes, absolutely.  There is a ton of work in Japan, and as you know Joe Hirl runs the office, but the products in EGM are crucial to its success.  I'd be happy to meet her.  Let me know how I can help. Jeff 
I think he has a strong resume.  He's definitely worth putting on the interview list. As for Japan opportunities, is there a way to get Tess Dyar plugged into those?  She just started (from Wharton) after spending nearly 10 years at Goldman in Japan.  She definitely has an interest in continuing her work with the country.  I think she's been a little disappointed since getting here and seeing APACHI dissolved. Suzanne 
what do you guys think.  Jeff If he is good, we have a lot to do in Japan. 
Hi Mr. Shankman, I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking to you. Sincerely yours, Christopher Handte ________________________________ Christopher Handte Wharton MBA Candidate, Class of 2001 4300 Spruce Street, Apt.

Hi Jeff, Thank you so much for coming last Friday and speaking to the students about resumes - and everything else!  I think your story was an extremely valuable one.  It is good for the students to hear that there is a life outside Wall Street, and that their desire for challenge and stimulation can be more than fulfilled outside of New York.  It is also good for them to hear that there is not one answer to any particular question, and I appreciated that you and all of your colleagues pushed back when they pressed you for THE ANSWER.  All of us at MBA Career Management can say that until we're blue in the face, but when you speak they listen. Thank you once again for participating.  And please pass on my best regards to Evan Betzer. Best regards, Sara Simons MBA Career Management

Jeff: It was a pleasure to meet you last week at the Inn at Penn.  It sounds as though Enron is doing some very exciting things with more to come in the future. I called Vince Kaminski a few times last week.  His secretary mentioned that he was off again this week on a business trip returning on Oct 9th, I believe.  I am confident that he will get a project proposal to us by the 13 Oct deadline. Thank you for your support of the Wharton School.  We look forward to having Enron host a Tiger Team Project.

Bobby retires this month, but will continue as a consultant to Enron India. His stated intention is to shadow Clay and his team to help arrange LNG supplies for Metgas.  We do not need this and it adds a layer of confusion whenever he is in attendance in negotiations, but to date neither Wade nor Sanjay has been willing or able to control this.  The India group tends to blame their failure to market Metgas supplies on the LNG team's ""failure"" to get better terms, and they insist that Bobby or others attend the meetings to ensure that we are doing a good job. We believe that we have obtained LNG for Metgas on favorable terms, particularly in light of the fact that we have convinced Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to accept the credit risk of Metgas customers, i.e., with no Ennron support in the middle and no Indian government support behind the buyers). They believe that our supplies are priced 50 cents above the ""market"", which they perceive to be Qatari supplies to Petronet ( a proposed government-backed LNG import project in Western India that is a long way from being real). We believe that we know the pricing terms for the proposed Petronet deal and that the price is not as low as rumored.  We also believe that the Metgas customers are willing to pay the price that we have negotiated and that the Metgas pipeline economics are sound (although the India group has been unwilling to share their economics with us) and that, once the LNG contracts are in place, we can reduce the LNG price significantly via a backhaul from Malaysia using ADGAS/TEPCO ships.   We can further reduce the price if we can get access to the spare capacity on the ship dedicated to DPC and use it to move incremental cargoes from Abu Dhabi to Metgas. Bobby and his team want us to reopen the price in the Mayasia term sheet.  We do not intend to do this.  Malaysia has told us that they will walk the deal if we insist on a lower price.  Malaysia recently sold additional volumes to Japan for a price about 20 cents higher than the price to Metgas and they believe they can also sell our volumes at a higher price to more creditworthy buyers in the far east. The Malaysia COI includes a cp that Metgas will finalize contracts with its end buyers by Sep 1999.  We have repeatedly  gotten Malaysia to extend this target date, which is now end October 2000, but Malaysia is getting impatient with India and I am not sure how much longer we can hold this together without some more firm evidence from India that the markets are real I will be in India on Oct 4/5 to meet with Sanjay and Wade to discuss this. We will also try to finalize the terms for us to provide LNG  fuel management and shipping services to both DPC and Metgas, and will seek clarification from Wade/Sanjay as to how they intend to sell down DPC/Metgas without losing control of the LNG terminal.  Clay, V V RAo and Wayne Perry will be with me. Working with India is never easy Rick 
I'm hearing a little noise about Bobby Ferris in Sanjay's group.  Did he retire or not?  Bobby's job is not going to one soley in which he directs the LNG team to source product for metgas.  What's the story? Jeff 
brad hitch Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/23/2000 10:12 AM 
Who should Clay and  V V be working with to get started on the Malaysia/Enron web page? 
fyi 
Hopefully Brunei LNG/Shell won't beat us to the punch.  You can bet that Mr. Damit at Brunei LNG gets his intelligence from Shell who no doubt are working on this already (Shell is in a JV that just rolled out an online shipping capacity/freight trading business this month). The first one to launch an LNG Trading internet platform will have an incredible advantage over all others. Dan 06:19 GMT  14 September 2000 PATTAYA, Thailand (Dow Jones)--Online liquefied natural gas trading is on the way and will challenge the way business in the industry is done, Mohammed Damit, head of LNG marketing for Brunei LNG Sdn Bhd, said this week at a gathering of gas industry executives. ""It's only a matter of time before we see energy trading activities on the net,"" Damit said, adding that the biggest LNG online opportunities are in ship chartering and spot LNG trading. Damit said online trading would result in greater price volatility. LNG prices are currently indexed to crude oil prices, in term contracts for as long as 20-30 years, that tend to smooth out price fluctuations over the life of the contract. Damit added that online traders will use standardized documents, simplifying trading. -By Lucy Hornby, Dow Jones Newswires; 65 421 4811; lucy.hornby@dowjones.com 
please follow up with this.  what are we talking to him about.  Jeff 
Will discuss this with Clay to get a better idea of his perceived workload. In the interim, we will follow up with Andrew to let him know that we will probably have a spot for him in the Enron organization so that he doesn't slip off the hook 
Any thoughts on this? Jeff 
Jeff, I don't know if I'm going to get to meet Andrew, but he looks good on paper. My only question is whether we need another person working on LNG in Dubai. Obviously, I don't know quite what structure you want to put in place, and perhaps there are some projects I'm not aware of, but from what I've seen I would be worried that this guy would get bored. Just a thought, but looking at this guy's resume he'd be an ideal guy to work with Jonathan Whitehead and Joe Hirl in Tokyo.  He speaks fluent Japanese, knows the Japanese market, has contacts at Mitsubishi, and knows the LNG world.  Quite frankly, he might do more good for Enron's LNG effort working for Enron Japan than for LNG. Also, regarding Elba Island, do you think you'd be ready for a conference call on Monday? Thanks, Brad

Some follow up on friday's meeting: We need to focus quickly on whether or not there is any deal to be done with Middle East suppliers that can contribute to Enron Europe's power project in Spain. Our pending deal with Adgas to ship LNG on the Heogh Galleon could be a good fit however  the current volume being discussed (0.3 MMTA) is only a small portion of the 1.3 to 1.5 MMTA required for the project in years 03+ (minimum delivery would be 1.0 MMTA).  We should press ADGAS to see if they would commit to a higher volume.  We also need to determine what we believe is the most effective pricing structure for the ADGAS LNG purchase (both in terms of supply to our project in Spain, but also for potential diversions to Europe in 01/02) and for what term.  Based on our discussions on friday, it may be that a crude based purchase price may work the best.  We have discussed both Brent and NYMEX based pricing formulas with ADGAS.  Merritt, Eric, lets add that to the agenda for our monday morning meeting and get some price structuring done. The structure of the ADGAS deal will be based on a U.S. delivery.  We will reserve the right to divert to any other market (except TEPCO).  We will likely have to share, in some way the shipping savings, if we divert to a non-U.S. terminal but I think we can keep any upside made on the indexed portion of the price for ourselves. In addition we will be contacting OMAN LNG to determine their ability to provide quantities to augment the ADGAS supplies, as well as potential shipping options (Exmar?)  Obviously we need to consider shipping requirements for our Atlantic Basin projects (i.e. Elba Island) when thinking about shipping for Spain.  I would also like to look at how Elba could be used as part of a potential take or pay avoidance strategy for the Spain power plant. I will try to keep everyone updated as the pieces come together. Thanks

At our LNG coordination meeting in London last Friday, I asked Doug Arnell to be the point person tocoordinate the assembly of a quick data base of all of our LNG sources and uses and ship availability over the next several years. He will work with Merritt Thomas, Brad Hitch and Eric Groves and will coordinate all of his work with Eric Gonzales. The purpose of this exercise is to give us, in light of the fact that we do not have an operational LNG book,  a quick picture of the overall situation so that we can make some quick calls on Hoegh Galleon, Abu Dhabi etc. I have noted that Doug has since started copying the two of you on lots of emails.  I will ask him to take the two of you out of the details on this for now so that we don't overload your email inboxes, unless you want to see all of the details. I will screen the emails and forward you info to keep you in the loop but at a higher altitude without all of the gory details. Please advise 
Rick, What is the network theory here?  I'm also not a fan of an only Jordanian play.  Politically, I'm not sure it makes sense, (like Gaza)  What's the benefit here? Jeff Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/25/2000 11:59 AM 
FYI---this project is heating up rapidly and may be quite attractive.  I had separate talks inLondon on Friday last week to explore turning this into a regional development project in the Aqaba/Eilat area at the tip of the red sea (where Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi all meet and where a regional planning authority is in place).  There may be a good opportunity for a regional power and district cooling plant with energy management and gas/power marketing opportunities. Will advise after Rob's meeting s in Cairo/Amman and after we scrub this at our Dubai planning meeting this week Rick 
Clear it with arnold if you want dutch.  Let me know as people come to you. the goal is to have people rotate into your group directly, or from the gas fundamentals group if possible, and vice versa. Keep me updated, and you, I and Lavo will work this out.  Jeff

Competition in Asia Pacific Region 
As promised.  Jeff 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive. Maybe I don't understand it all. Bruce Lundstrom 09/25/2000 03:54 PM Sent by: Liz N Martinez 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels - At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns. Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2. Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco. The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a ""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates. The following is a summary of these competition provisions: Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk management services. There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction. ""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix). ""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii). It does not include Japan and Australia. The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003. Thank you, Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

CUSTOMER BUSINESS - EOL Jeff - I think your ideas of adding marketing and research analysis to the group are good starting points. I don't feel this will increase revenues for us in 2001 as our  efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin volume environment.  Eventually the captured deal flow should help the group trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a significant recruitment and training effort.   Both the recruitment and the teaching process are ones that we need to focus on.  Please let me know what you have in mind on the recruitment side and I would like to highlight that I feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates.  I plan on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team that I'm assembling in London.   By end October, the London office will have 5 managers, 4 associates and 1 analyst in our group.  This is a real shift from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors. Given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside (about 33% success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron) I think this is the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus toward teaching. My plan is to put much of the associate resources toward EOL marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and analysis.  The one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the consulting companies in London and I'm putting him in charge of drawing up a list of potential customers in every European country.  Please let me know if you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing business.  Can't help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future.  Having seen the ICE demo I would prefer that system of ours because of volume.  This is a complaint that I have heard from many traders regarding the use of our system.  The challenge is how can we put up more volumes, more markets, and tighter 2 ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run over.  What do we know about the ESPEED system and what they are going to have.  I saw a Reuters story saying they were launching Oct 2nd with Koch, Dynergy, Entergy, Willams, and a few others.  Are we thinking about trying to join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have?   This is area that we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if we fail to be the largest in this platform.  I don't feel that in the oil business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers.   We are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the industry will look at two different e-trading sites. BUILDING THE PHYSICAL TRADING BUSINESS This has always received luke-warm interest from Enron.  I believe that the inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on that alone.   So when we talk about going big that really means getting involved in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physical business.  Tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortest financial commitment.  Mike and Jeff you should be aware though that the corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor.  We can candycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets.  We have a credit department that have done a poor job, if any at all, in getting out there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to participate with (petrobras, pertamina, petrolimex, sinochem, sinopec, egpc, nnpc) if we have any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes.   We are also the worst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we have a commitment to perform.  Our contracts are also drafted with many escape clauses that will be rejected by many end-users who will insist on a greater performance guarantee.  As we discussed briefly in Singapore, I think there are several airlines that we could target in the U.S. for physical supply.  I will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential damages that the airlines have in their tenders.   Previously, I have not gone after this business because I didn't believe we would have the political clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such matters.  Please consider this (I will fax you a tender offer from Japan Airlines) and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars.  That kind of loss I have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline business. I will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go forward....this message was more to highlight how I'm trying to advance the group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment.  Lastly, on that theme we are trying to work with IT over here to develop some systems that will make us better suited to do customer business.  At the moment everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying to get toward a server based system and options system that would be available to everybody and designed by IT people instead of traders.  I will let you know if we need any help from you on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the London IT department. 
we need to proceed with pricing this, but let's help these guys understand. Merritt Thomas                09/29/2000 05:27 AM 
Eric thought you might want to see this.  Obviously Brad can tell you more if you are interested. Regards, Merritt 
Merritt, Call me to hear the latest about the Northwest Shelf deal.  V V  left me a message saying that he would still let us ""work on the pricing, structuring side"", but that he's been kicking his bid around with Wayne, Clay and Rick and they're going to put together their own idea.  Gee, are you getting the impression that they don't get it?  They seem to want to go long on Australian cargoes by bidding at a price that would only make economic sense if it goes into India.  They're not going to go through us to get there. They didn't comprehend that to take a long position means that you are putting that position in a book.  I'm going to lose it.

Jeff-- Thanks for the offer. I was really hoping to do a structuring rotation. I have some interviews set up this week, so I will let you know what I decide to do this week.  Thanks again. Purvi 
Thanks for the note.   I have a spot for you in our fundamentals group, which there is a lot of interaction with tech, traders, and marketers, and good, broad exposure to a number of enron's businesses.

Jeff- Pete Keavey asked me to send you my resume. I was working in Dutch Quigley's group for my first rotation. My second rotation was in the CALME Structuring Group. Since CALME is going through a reorganization, the analysts were told to find new rotations. I am currently interviewing with a few groups and I would like for you to take a look at my resume. Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for your time. Purvi Patel

I haven't seen this yet.  any update? David P Dupre 09/29/2000 09:53 AM 
Jeff: I stopped by your office to deliver the following in person, but you moved recently. I talked to Jennifer, discovered your new office location, and will have this on your desk today. Thanks, David 3-3528 
Sure.  Write it and I'll sign it.  Outline the activities below. Jeff David P Dupre 09/22/2000 02:21 PM 
Jeff: Do you have an interest in providing a recommendation letter for my application to the analyst program? During my tenure of one year at Enron, I've assisted Errol and Dutch manage Mike Maggi and John Arnold's positions including xpits/deliveries, etc. to effectively ensure that their positions (and risks) have complete accuracy. As you know, I am responsible for this task for all groups. Furthermore, I constantly seek new methods of creating value in the natural gas (and other) groups. As you may know, I am working with John Arnold on a project to evaluate our existing brokers to utilize their credit lines properly which are interest-free (most of them) so that we may reduce our interest costs associated with initial margins. I'd like to meet with you briefly to discuss your thoughts on the MG meeting last week and assist you in any follow-up endeavors.  I'll contact Sheila Glover, if you wish, next week, to see if she has received the contact list which you requested. Representatives of Wharton's admissions group will be here on Monday, October 16 for a presentation for prospective graduate business school students which I will be attending. Thanks. David  3-3528 
just swing by or call my asst Jennifer 39440 to set it up. David P Dupre 09/01/2000 04:52 PM

SUMMARY ATLANTIC Mixed signals coming from the market at present with Billiton approaching us to buy FOB stem at RBCT for a cargo each Q2/Q3 and were active for the first time in a while in the SECA market buying up 2nd half 2001 material. Meanwhile there remains to be South African resell tonnage coming our way - predominantly appearing by way of the Spanish utilities who continue to have excellent hydro levels and ourability to source South African Call Options on FOB RBCT level with strike of $32.50 seems to question the recent information that Billitonsold tonnage at $33.25 equivalent into European consumers for the rest of the year Furthermore for the first time this year we begin to see Colombian resell material appearing on the market both on a CIF and FOB basis - probably no coincidence that this comes at a time when some of the steam seems to have come off the U.S. spot market. Overall the tone seems to be firmer but with very few new fundamental inputs to fuel this but rather producer sentiment  After weeks of tentatively drifting south the SECA market traded up a dollar along the whole curve last week. This was really a consequence of a few looking to buy into a market void of sellers which was itself is directly a function of peoples unwillingness to further sponsor a market which has come down some $5 from it's high's. The spot market is now trading at $40.50 Fob barge Rotterdam, 2nd half of the year at $40.25 and then 2002 at $39.50. PACIFIC Despite the extensive coverage which the Far East seems to be attracting with regards to economic slowdowns/weakness the Pacificmarket continues to be tight. The JSM/Producers continue their annual negotiations, but expect to see few conclusions from these in theshort term as the JSM's continue to exercise all the options they have to keep the drip feed going and most have clauses in their contractswhich allow them to carry on shipping material despite any agreement until September time. Both KEPCO and Lafarge have come out with tenders for the delivery of coal for prompt shipment - it is definitely a sign of progress that we are being invited to bid but without any length with which to play with, going short in front of Glencore and Rio could be expensive - the plan will be to participate without winning the business. The Chinese Annual Coal Fair took place over the last cuppla weeks where contracts for 2001 are negotiated and various sectors lobbyfor their allocation on infrastructure. The major takeaway's from the meeting were that total production is estimated at 950 million mt for 2001with exports targeted at 63 million mt - up 5 million mt from last year. Despite increased export targets, the sentiment remains bullish with most producers asking between $29 and $31 representing a $3/$4 increase versus 2000 prices. Strong domestic prices will limit any downside in the export market and while the government is keen to keep pushing exports there is a general  scepticism over the ability of the rail to move the projected tonnage. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a producer based in Inner Mongolia (ZCIC)to market upto 1 million mt per year into the export market - all going well this will provide us with the necessary length to be able to target business in the region more aggressively. GAMEPLAN We continue to try and take advantage of this mismatch between the origin markets and the European market by selling out of origin lengthand using the resell market to pick up tonnage to service our commitments at destination. We are working several bits of long-term destinationbusiness in the Atlantic which if successful will serve as a melting pot for any length we have remaining in that basin and more. We will alsolook to sell into any further rally in the destination SECA mkt. Despite fundamentals in Asia pointing to a slowdown in demand the consolidation we are seeing in Australia will certainly prevent any collapse in prices and short-term expect prices to head higher than the $30 I wud call FOB Newcastle today. It will be very difficult for us to get any ammunition for the near-term but we are looking at various projects which will again give us access to coal further out in the curve and at the same time are exploring any opportunity to own some optionality to give us some protection against a continued squeeze further out in the curve. Best Regards 
I think doing a EGM only prc is probably the right way to go.  We will need to do a good job (and have the ability to cross calibrate) understanding the other business units performance as well. Jeff Enron North America Corp.

Dear Mr. Shankman, ? How are you doing? We met last week at the  undergraduate Enron presentation and discussed the possibility of an Enron/ESPN  deal that would enable television viewers to order old sporting events over the  television (similar to the Blockbuster deal). You told me to send you an email  around this time to follow up, so I can find out who to contact to get the ball rolling. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my idea. ? Sincerely, Zachary Costello 
Thanks for your interest.  Of course I remember our conversation.  By now I'm sure you know you are on our interview list.  (If I told you prematurely, use it to your advantage somehow with your friends.)  I've contacted one of our head broadband marketers to set up an introduction, and see where this goes. It's a great idea, and you should hear back from me shortly, when David responds to me call. Best regards, Jeff P.S.

I'm not sure that thor understands dollars flowing with risk.  What should we do with him? 
fyi - it doesn't sound like the weather piece of the Oslo long-term deals is going to have much value.  We are still trying to get that value from Oslo and ensure that the weather risk is captured appropriately in EGM risk books.  I will keep you updated.

we are working with the systems development group here in london to create for the global products trading group a curve spreadsheet and options calculator (can do cracks spreads and asian options).  the aim is that we can have a central site that is accessible to other groups and all traders/marketers in this group to facilitate our ability to service customer business.  brian hudson is the person who developed this system for the gas and power groups here in europe and has been recommened to us by steven leppard who heads the IT research department.   Without going into the systems history story here I think we are inadequately prepared on this side and need to strengthen in this area.  We understand from Steve that in order for them to dedicate the resources required for what we are asking they would like to take on an additional person that would be partly for our and the coal group's acct.  Steve can keep this individual busy with other projects so it would not be a full time expense for Global Products.  our excel spreadsheets methodology is not stable enough given the increasing unreliability of the London servers which keep falling over and thus the traders without any pricing tools.  This is what brought about our discussions with the IT department to try and improve the present system.

print this and i need a folder titled ARA Coal Summary 
MKT SUMMARY Dust is settling after latest supply side incident to hit the market - namely the Drummond Force Majeure. What remains now is cif mkt which is in backwardisation for Q4 and Q1 01 versus the rest of 2001 but where stocks in Rotterdam are at near record highs at around 2.5 million mt for the end of September. Indeed, utilities and traders alike have taken advantage of the weak spot mkt we experienced during August and early September to buy up distressed parcels in ARA and play the cash / carry game. This has certainly paid dividends as any slack which was in the pipeline has certainly been swallowed due to a number of incidents which has restricted production/shipments from various geographies. While the whole curve has shifted north as a result of early buying interest for 2001 the backwardisation in the frt curves coupled with above has seen Q4 and Q1 prices increase by some $4 over past 6 weeks to absolute values at $39 cif ARA - this represents a prm of between $0.75-$1.00 over Jan/Dec 01 run. Believe the front end will continue to remain tight due to supply squeeze we are feeling and high frt rates but going forward into next year we may see some price pressure from levels we are today as a consequence of lower frt rates, increase in prod'n, synfuel into Europe and weaker continental power prices from the high levels they are today. Control of FOB origin prices through continued consolidation in the production side of the industry could put ruin to this and hence we look for opportunities to spread our long FOB origin posn into as many geographies as possible. SPOT TRADES Bot one pnmx of Caypa Steam coal from Masefield for December shipment FOB Santa Marta at $US 31 basis 11800btu. Sold 70mmt of chinese material to EVN delivered stockpile for October and November delivery at what is the equivalent of $41 fob barge Rotterdam basis 6000 kcal/kg Switched 20mmt Australian Steam Coal Fob barge Rotterdam with Electrabel for 20mmt of Colombian Steamcoal at agreed differential. Bot physical put option from TXU (still to be finalised) for Cape quantity for Q1 delivery with a $40 strike price basis Rotterdam and $40.40 basis Hunterston at $0.75 cent premium with exercise date of 30th November. Sold 2 x 15mmt SECA contracts to Glencore for December delivery at $40 Fob barge and $40.50 fob barge respectively. SELLING SIDE Mission continue to look for La Loma material for December delivery - now looking at 2 pnmx 1 into east coast and 1 into hunterston. Bewag have tender out for 500mmt for 2001 Rheinbraun/Duisbourg combined looking for close to 250mmt Colombian material on delivered basis. Working with Electrabel to offer them 50mmt a month for 2001 Veag looking for 300mmt cif Rostock for Nov 00/June 01. EDFT after tonnage for Q4 and a cape a month Q101. Endesa - 4 capes for 2001. Fenosa - looking for 250mmt of low vol U.S material split across 2001. HdelC entertaining swap of Russian material for U.S coal during 2001 Billiton looking for small parcel of Colombian material in ARA. BUYING SIDE Emerald - still looking to buy high Sulphur material from U.S to execute Preussen deal. 3 firm pnmx plus 3 options. Masefield - offered further pnmx cargo of 11800 material for Q1 delivery at $32 FOB Santa Marta. BBC Trading - 10-15mmt Russian material ex-stockpile Sczcecin to supply our bewag commitments. Putting final touches to purchasing South African Material FOB RBCT for 200. Likely to be a cape quantity for Q2 delivery. AES - UK coal for Q4 and Q1 2001. BHP - 1 June 2001 Cape. EOL We are just shy of reaching 500,000mt mark for total volume of tonnage traded via EOL with the activity that went on this week. There continues to be excellent interest from all sectors of the industry and we really need to focus on converting the increasing number of guest user ID's we are giving out into actual transactions on the system - many are still afraid of the technology, many are still ignorant of how they can utilise the system as a risk management tool and many simply don't have the authority - hence we continue to focus on preaching the word to all and sundry!! Highlight this week was having Glencore trade on two occasions and not surprisingly they were propping the mkt up on the buy side. We are moving ahead with posting options on the SECA contract on EOL. GAMEPLAN Current mkt environment has generated healthy buying interest for 2001 and with the expectation that we will still see frt rates ease off for 2001 from the high levels today ($9.50 RBCT - ARA Cape) combined with a somewhat weaker tone in continental power prices for 01 we are fairly keen to hit some of this business at current price levels. We have benefited from the current price hike maintaining an overall long position but with the lions share of that long being placed in Drummond we must focus on securing physical commitments from Drummond for first half 01 shipments in order to participate in any of this business with peace of mind. Hence we continue to look for opportunities to tie up tonnage from other geographies such as South Africa, Australia, U.S and Russia that will allow us the flexibility which adds so much value to our book. Have extended dlist this week - if you donot wish to receive then please let me know and likewise if you would like people added. Best Regards Jez

Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling this terminal We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any thoughts or suggestions Rick

Hi, hope things are well.  I'd like to talk about LNG trading vessels (merchant).  Have you been  talking with Pierre about all of this activity. George Mclellan is concerned about the exmar contract, and wants Pierre more involved with the business.  What do you think of this idea?  What are some of your thoughts regarding this business. 
I'm still getting all the reports too late.  I'd like a night clerk to put 
As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today. Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular. If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM. This restructure will similarly align weather. Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
an update for both Mike and I would be great.  thanks.  Jeff V V Rao 02/10/2001 06:37 PM

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 06/2001 Highlight Cape market is bouncing back after having fallen for the best part of two months.  The bounce is expected to be gentle and not long lasting.  Owners are raising their rates for March cargoes as there appears to be a few more cargoes around mostly attributed to the fact that Japanese steel mills expect coal and Iron Ore prices for this year to increase and are therefore maximising their current contracts.  Furthermore, Bunkers have risen sharply over the last 10 days to over $130 in Rotterdam which was not expected by the market.  Of interest, Bocimar is redelivering ships it had taken on short period last year back to the head owner earlier than their contract allows for which has a few owners thinking about suing Bocimar for damages. The panamax atlantic market has been falling hard over the last week with little grain movement from the US gulf and fresh Japanese concerns of GM crops imports from the US.  However, the Plate season is expected to start in March and market anticipates a return to healthy rates then.   The pacific is also falling from incredibly strong rates seen three weeks ago before the Chinese new year. On the long term time charter with Mitsui, Mitsui has officially lifted their board of approval subjects and we are working through the internal documentation/proper sign off at this stage. We have offered some competitive freight rates to the US steel group to import steel slabs from Turkey to US in the hope of providing the freight for this business when it happens.  Pierre is meeting with the pulp and paper guys while in Houston at the end of Feb and also going through NYC to meet up with the Enron metals shipping guy to discuss joint efforts in shipping to maximise synergy's and cost savings.  Furthermore, we are currently discussing with the US weather group the possibility of offering protection to ship owners for days lost at seas due to severe weather.

Howdy J.R. I think that the weekend of April 7-8 is good for the two of us. I will check with the wife and let you know. I can't wait to check out your digs and for the Shari flip-out moment, meeting Rauschenburg. Talk to you soon. > ---------- 
Hi Dave.  As a follow up to out conversation, I found out Robert Rauschenburg will be here April 5 or 6 and the weekend (April 7-8).  See how that looks on the calendar for y'all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland.  (I did go to the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots, and a cowboy hat my group gave me--pictures to follow) Can you believe I went to the Rodeo? 
Thanks for the clarification.  Jeff Habiba Bayi@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/09/2001 01:00 PM 
Jeff, I apologize, because I realise that I had not introduced myself to you.  I work with John Ambler as Director for International Marketing and Public Relations.  The original release was drafted by Envera and since our PR department provides support for the Crude and Liquids Product group, as part of our PR responsibilities for EGM, it was sent to us to revise and run through the approval process.  The copy I sent to you is the revised version that we completed.  We now will send it through the Corp. PR approval process, which includes a review by Investor Relations. Again, thank you for your kind cooperation. Habiba

Another article from the competitive intelligence group. =20 Jeff 
Per our conversations with most of you this week, Brendan and I have=20 developed the following information on Asian Pulp & Paper and its potential= =20 to trigger widescale credit problems in Asia.  In the past week, APP has co= me=20 close to default through complex trigger clauses in a mass of junk bond=20 issues. Prospects of an APP default have already sent tremors through the= =20 Asian bond market and could have larger implications for emerging market=20 debt. This week, the Indonesian government further complicated the picture = by=20 attaching assets of the Sinar Mas group, including APP, to guarantees of=20 Sinar Mas group=01,s $1.5 billion debt to Bank Internasional Indonesia (BII= ),=20 Indonesia=01,s fifth largest bank and formerly part of a Sinar Mas group.  = The=20 Wijaya family is likely to postpone payments until the last possible minute= ,=20 before seeking a workout and corporate restructuring. RJ The Immediate Problem o $1.6 billion in bonds are due in 2001, on top of $1.5 billion owed to the= =20 Indonesian government through the Sinar Mas group o Between now and April 30, the APP group must come up with $145 million fo= r=20 nine separate coupon payments coming due. APP itself will owe $87 million i= n=20 interest payments on four bonds over the next month o APP missed a February 1 deadline for two bond payments of $43 million; on= e=20 payment has been made but the other, of $13.5 million, is still hanging Risks are formidable, with management playing a cat and mouse game with bon= d=20 holders in order to maximize their negotiating position in a restructuring: o Assets are encumbered by complex cross-guarantees that make it difficult = to=20 impossible to separate out individual properties o The New York Stock Exchange has threatened a de-listing unless APP stock= =20 rises above the US$1 level; de-listing will trigger immediate redemption=20 clauses in some classes of bonds o The company=01,s Indonesian assets are diseased. Despite APP=01,s apparen= tly=20 sound business model, it is being corrupted by crime that is systemic withi= n=20 the Indonesian forestry and forest products industry o Inventory dumping by APP, particularly in China, has been a major factor= =20 depressing paper prices since mid-2000 o APP=01,s management has failed to offer transparent explanations for thei= r=20 cash shortages. It has not reported third quarter earnings for 2000, due la= st=20 November, to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (although, as a=20 foreign company it has six months to report earnings, versus one month for = US=20 companies). Inter-company transfers may be masking serious problems within= =20 the APP group.=20 o Indonesian political instability is worsening with the threatened=20 impeachment of Indonesia=01,s President Wahid, lowering prospects for a=20 government bailout of APP=01,s parent company, the Sinar Mas group, and its= =20 owners, the Wijaya family. o There are clear prospects for collateral damage to Asian capital markets,= =20 with S&P already cutting ratings and a consequent shrinkage of liquidity.= =20 APP Risk Profile: APP=01,s only immediate hope of meeting its debt payments is through asset = sales=20 or a sell-off of pulp and paper inventory. Neither has much chance of=20 success. APP=01,s current strategy is to muscle its bond-holders into a=20 restructuring agreement as soon as possible, most likely before an early=20 March deadline for its next coupon payment falls due. There are significant= =20 obstacles to evaluation of assets in a restructuring, from cross-guarantees= =20 of bond issues that range across classes of bond holders and various=20 jurisdictions, to inter-company transfers that present a false picture of= =20 financial health in some of its operating companies. Such obstacles ensure= =20 that a restructuring exercise will be lengthy. APP is the fifth largest=20 issuer of junk bonds in the world, and has been regarded as a benchmark bon= d=20 for Indonesia. Until the last few months, it was the only bond in the world= =20 that traded at a premium to its own government=01,s bonds, and was the only= =20 Indonesian issuer to raise funds successfully from capital markets in the= =20 depth of the Asian crisis. A pronounced ripple effect is likely on Asian=20 bonds in the event of a default, as investors wait to see what happens to= =20 unsecured creditors who account for 40 percent to 50 percent of APP=01,s US= $12=20 billion in debt. At the moment, systemic fallout seems likely to be limited= =20 to the Asian region, as investors revert to the hostile stance adopted duri= ng=20 the Asian financial crisis.=20 APP Key Decision Makers: The key decision makers at APP are CFO Hendrik Tse and CEO Teguh Ganda=20 Wijaya. No others in the company are privy to all the Group=01,s Affairs, o= r to=20 corporate strategy. Information is extremely closely held. Sources say that= =20 the APP situation is so complex that no one individual has a comprehensive= =20 understanding of all the potential ramifications of a decision on any one o= f=20 the assets of APP or its subsidiaries, so complex are the cross guarantees= =20 and trigger clauses in the debt paper issued over the last few years. Tee and Teguh Wijaya are to a large extent playing a bluff game, engaging i= n=20 brinkmanship with their bond holders. It signaled the market that it could= =20 move into a default situation on February 1 when its paper making subsidiar= y,=20 Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimiah, failed to make payments on two different bond= =20 issues worth $43 million. On February 6, APP finally paid the coupon on one= =20 of the bonds, a US$600 million note issued by Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritius= ,=20 just within a grace period of five business days. If Tjiwi Kimia had failed= =20 to meet the deadline, it would have triggered cross default clauses on a=20 series of other bonds. The second coupon payment, of $13.5 million, for a= =20 US$200 million issue of guaranteed senior notes due in 2001, is now late. W= e=20 expect APP to wait until the last possible moment to make the payment. The= =20 group is husbanding its cash in advance of an expected restructuring. The= =20 better its cash position is, the more APP will be able to operate from a=20 position of strength in a restructuring negotiation.=20 According to one source: APP is =01&signaling the market and its bond holde= rs=20 that it is in their best interest to help with a restructuring before=20 everything collapse. The idea is to squeeze the bondholders now, while they= =20 still have some negotiating leverage rather than wait until there is nothin= g=20 left.=018 APP is trying to play off one set of bond holders against another= =20 because the interests of the bond holders in the operating companies, some = of=20 which have significant cash flow, is different from those in the parent. Th= is=20 is obviously a dangerous game, but one in which APP feels it has no choice= =20 but to engage. The earlier it can restructure the better of it will be, and= =20 the greater its chances of survival in some form. Trying to keep control of= =20 the situation so that it doesn=01,t unravel is the name of the game at this= =20 point. Tee and Widjaja are thinking quite far ahead and have targeted their= =20 non-core subsidiaries for disposal in a debt restructuring. They have been= =20 actively shopping their China assets for several months, and sources indica= te=20 that their packaging assets will also go on the block. APP is still hopeful= ,=20 however, of engineering a debt restructuring so that it is on their terms. One of the issues that adds greatly to the complexity of the situation is= =20 that much of the sales from both companies come from within the group, and= =20 often these go via another APP company or Sinar Mas. Another source said,= =20 =01&This is a vertically integrated group and one of the worries is that if= you=20 start messing with the structure, let=01,s say one group of bond holders wa= nts=20 to wind up one of the subsidiaries that is a primary customer, you could=20 threaten the whole group.=018=20 The Wijayas are well regarded by foreign investors, and are not in the=20 category of Suharto cronies such as forestry magnate Bob Hassan, who was=20 sentenced this past week to two years in jail for financial wrongdoings and= =20 corruption. They are not saints =01) the Indonesian government removed the= =20 Wijayas from the board of Bank Internasional Indonesia after it was=20 nationalized in 1999, based on evidence that they exceeded the 30 percent c= ap=20 for lending to affiliates. However, they depend heavily on international=20 capital markets for funding and cannot afford significant steps that would= =20 bar future access. At the moment, they have few alternatives to raise cash = to=20 meet their debt payments other than through asset and inventory sales. The= =20 company has built up substantial paper inventory, and according to one=20 source, it could use inventory sales to meet current cash obligations if it= =20 could find a buyer. This is a big if, however, since current prices are=20 depressed and releasing further inventory to the market would only make=20 matters worse. Asset Sales and Other Alternatives to Meet Debt Repayments: An executive from a major international pulp and paper company confirmed th= at=20 APP was actively trying to sell its Chinese assets.  These assets include: o PT Ekamas Fortuna o PT Purinusa Ekapersada o Ningbo Zhonghua Paper o Gold Hongye Paper o Gold Hai Paper (Kunshan) Co. o Jin Yu (Qingyuan) Tissue Paper Industry The executive said that his company had looked at attractive parts of the= =20 assets on offer, but had held back because of the impenetrable cross=20 guarantees between companies and reluctance of their bankers to finance an= =20 acquisition at a discount that would offer no cover for their equity. The= =20 executive believed that all the banks would have to agree to asset sales in= =20 the context of a general restructuring before any individual bank would=20 finance an acquisition. Yet another issue is that the financing of the Chin= a=20 factories was based on access to Indonesian pulp at intra-company prices.= =20 Once the company is broken up into pieces, it will have to rely on the worl= d=20 market and will no longer be able to produce at a profit. =20 Stora Enso made a formal bid for the assets last year but was rejected.

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists today. Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular. If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM. This restructure will similarly align weather.

Can you try to use your amazing persuasion skills on Mauricio - he has an Associate offer and came to sell weekend.  He's trying to decide between us and ABN Amro (also had a JP Morgan offer, but decided not to take it).  His concern is the $10k differential on our signing bonus and $20k differential in the guaranteed year end bonus because he wants to pay down his loans.  He wants to see if there is anything that we can do.  He feels like Enron is the better long term choice, but banking is a better short term choice. Can you give him a call - 215.732.9989 (home) or 215.432.0183 (cell). Michele Nezi Marvin Manager Enron Broadband Services

The Asian Pulp & Paper debt situation is once again becoming critical to Asian growth prospects.  AP & P is the most popular Asian bond holding among foreign investors.  AP & P narrowly met a Feb.1 deadline for a debt payment and has a 30 day grace period on another which runs out at the end of February.  Depressed pulp and paper prices and a high risk premium for Indonesian debt raise serious doubts about AP & P's ability to meet this payment. The ripple effect of an AP &P default or government-imposed restructuring would be significant for Asian credit and equity markets, with possible contagion effects for other emerging markets.  We will continue to update this issue in the days ahead.

Jeff Bjarne was reviewed as a part of Enron Europe this time and his promotion was based on a long period of  high performance.   He is viewed as one of the most valuable people in the business and there was no controversy whatsoever in London about his promotion.   In fact I repeatedly get calls for his services from various groups around Europe who would love to hire him if they had the opportunity.  In Oslo he has been one of the main contributors behind most off our models, and I think that the job he has done with setting up the Weather desk here in Oslo deserves very positive feedback, even if we didn't make money last year.  We have really moved up the deal flow and are poised for an outstanding year 2001 in Weather. In the future I will obviously cross check all things like this with you and Mark, so there aren't any misunderstandings going forward. Regards Thor 
Hi Thor, Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is never a bad thing. I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up. Jeff

No problem.  I will probably be in NY sometime later this month.  If he is interested in having a beer, I am interested in buying. Joe

Jeff, I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders for some of your transportation work.  Please do not go directly to the traders, rather the structuring desk.  Also, please coordinate your activites with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and rail issues.  We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of the customers you've pitched.  In most cases, we have been covering many of these customers from the energy side already.

BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE IN THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY (SOURCING AND SELLING TO LARGE/INDUSTRIAL CLIENTS) I AM INTERESTED IN APPLYING FOR A JOB I SAW ON ENRON'S WEBSITE.

BUT, I AM AFRAID IF I SEND MY RESUME TO THE HUMAN RESOURCE DEPT, THEY WILL BE CONFUSED BY MY ENTERTAINMENT / FERTILIZER EXPERIENCE.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF THERE IS ANYONE YOU KNOW, AT ENRON NY, THAT I CAN MEET WITH PERSONALLY.  IN A MEETING I CAN EXPLAIN MY EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS BETTER THAN I CAN IN MY RESUME.

All of your concerns are valid, and I too would like to work through them with you.  As info, Mike will be over in two weeks.  Organizationally, strategically, talent, and back office--we will get there.  Who particularly are you worried about.  As far as your situation, let's talk numbers.  I'd like you to believe that trading, and management, particularly your leadership, will pay off for you. Later....Jeff Chris Mahoney 01/31/2001 03:02 PM 
jeff, when I came to Houston in late December there were, if you recall,  a number of issues that I had hoped to discuss with you.  We only really scratched the surface with the reorganisation announced today.  I would prioritise them as follows: 1) recruiting, training, and keeping talent. there is a lack of depth in the organisation.  to make matters worse most of the recruiting was done by greg whalley and now all of those traders are on expiring or expired contracts.  the fact that all of them on the international side received bonuses less than last year doesn't help.   also the industry is expansion mode so it is harder to recruit and keep talent.  we are running the risk of getting left with the unhireable and losing the best. 2) vision. having worked for enron for three years i realise that the company seeks self-starters.  one of the frustrations that I have in Europe, and is a problem with the group overall, is that too many of the employees are on their heels waiting for direction from above.  that is one of the things I was hoping we might address in a reorganisation that shrunk the business units. smaller teams would be more focused on opportunities to grow the business, communicate better, and energise the environment.   still we need as senior management to discuss in a more specific sense where we need to improve the most.  you have identified customer business, eol, and research as the three key areas.  I would like to discuss with you the priority of being able to sell physical fuels.  the easiest thing to do is get long expensive oil and the hardest thing to do is develop a system.  this group has made almost no progress in developing a physical system.  that is what I will be working on in the heating, diesel, and jet fuel markets.  I would have thought the greatest and first opportunity that we need to be exploiting is fuel supply to utilities.  btu related shorts, that leverage upon our existing gas contacts, would seem to be our greatest inherent advantage vs our competition.  also it could focus our fuel oil and middle distillate group on the opportunities between gas and liquids.  The relationships have never been closer and this seems to be a situation that could remain for a long time.   the u.s. presents more opportunites but we are making good progress in developing financial hedging business in europe with continental gas and I'm pushing the origination groups in Europe to look into the physical supply opportunities. 3) systems. I'm going to spend sometime with Brent Price tomorrow but my conclusion on doing the post-mortem on Spain is that we need to resource the back office significantly before we can significantly grow the business.  They are struggling to keep up at the moment and the process seems very bureaucratic and inefficient.  This worries me because if you look at the problems that we have gotten into in the past we don't seem to have made great progress in eliminating the probability of there reoccurance. now in terms of the situation with myself.  please put yourself in my shoes for a minute.  I have had no life for the last year sorting out the crap of others (q1 - helsinki/q4 - spain).  in the middle part of the year I had to spend much time addressing the people issues and other problems created by the vacumn of no managment in London for over a year.  Was able to coordinate a good profit on the gasoil books that was pissed away.  In addition, I have had to take back over the book because ross was not capable of managing the short gamma position that was chopping him up.  the point being that managing didn't pay.   I have to run but these I want to discuss.

Dear Mr. Shankman, I guess I stumped you with my resume.  Nevertheless, I still would like to hear your comments - positive or negative.  As mentioned, I am extremely interested in working  for Enron and would like to pursue that jop opportunity. Look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Rina 
this was the guy that hired fred d'ambrosia back to enron after he was terminated for cause.  a.g. is an ok guy but i'm not in love.  i would however put him through the interview process.  i'll follow up. Mike McConnell 01/30/2001 06:54 AM 
Jeff, Interesting.  Do you like this guy?  What about Crude and products origination working for Randy?  On the LNG front we should look at him if you like him but i don't think it is a no brainer.  Neal will be coming on in 2 weeks, do we need him?  Maybe we do. m 
Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the gas trading h.r. people with respect to robin menear.  she was listed as commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a commercial manager.  Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though this was a problem at mid year as well.   Of course he told me it had been taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.  he too was involved in the hiring decision.

Hi Chris, Give me a ring tomorrow (tuesday) morn when you get a second.  I'd like to go over a couple of things and need your input. 
How was the weekend?  Mine was good--I met Dennis Hopper, the actor.  He is one cool dude.  I'm thinking about taking a long weekend vacation.  Where sounds fun? 
FYI.  What do you think? 
Jeff: I believe you are aware the MetGas project has been suspended indefinitely, primarily due to the negative impact and uncertainty caused by the problems Dabhol Power is currently experiencing.  Enron  has suspended work to close project financing and we have significantly reduced the MetGas staff.  The Team will focus on completing the acquisition of all major permits and clearances over the next few weeks.  The go forward plan is to either package MetGas ""as is"" and sell it off or use it as leverage in the negotiation of the DPC workout with the Indian government. I will be relocating from India back to Houston  in the near future.  In anticipation of this relocation I am exploring possible job opportunities within the Enron family of companies. I believe I can add value to your team's efforts in developing the LNG projects in both Venezuela and the Bahamas.  I have experience related to both projects and I can hit the ground running.   In addition, I bring prior ECT experience and success as a deal maker / originator, extensive experience in LNG including the development of production facilities, regasification and related harbour facilities and experience negotiating LNG Sale & Purchase Agreements as both a buyer or seller. Coupled to this experience is my knowledge of what it takes to structure assets and the pertinent commercial documents such that the asset can be project financed.  I am confident I can be of help and add value to your Western hemisphere LNG Team. I would appreciate you taking the time to review my resume and keeping me in mind when looking to fill any current or future positions. Thanks... 
Let's get together on this in the next couple of days.  Thanks.  Jeff Stinson Gibner 01/29/2001 12:10 PM 
Jeff, We are reviewing the P+ spread option book.    One item of note is that the correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not allow it, so he was using 0.999. We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just let me know what time would be convenient. --Stinson x34748

SUMMARY Atlantic Over the last week we have really seen the consequences of the wet and warm winter in Europe with a total of some 1.7 million tonnes being offered to us on the resell for delivery over the next couple of months. As a consequence spot/Q2 prices are now trading at $2 discount to replacement from South Africa ($40.75 FOB ARA versus $42.75 replacement) - a concept which many are struggling to get their head round. The Lion's share of the resell mkt is South African which makes sense as the strong U.S. mkt has taken what little slack there has been in the South American pipeline. In truth, while the U.S. mkt has been steaming, only very limited incremental tonnage from SAM has made it into the U.S. as the Utilities only pay up for spot spot material. If the steep backwardisation in the U.S. rolls forward there may remain opportunities to bury spot SAM cargoes at high levels but one thing is for sure is that the strong U.S domestic market will keep U.S. exports into Europe very low. Pacific Very few Australian cargoes have found their way to the fair shores of Europe over the last few months and this has been a function of the strong Pacific market at the back end of 2000 and indeed in part due to the consolidation which has been going on, the latest development to be Rio Tinto's acquirement of Peabody's asset's in Oz. We are currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz producers and the JSM's for pricing of their long-term contracts. It is not a secret that the producer's plan to go for broke and are looking to lock in prices above $30 FOB Newcastle - currently wud call the mkt $28.50. JSM's are apparently holding tight citing world economic slowdown.  At $28 the oz producer is making some $13 a tonne, the chinese are due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel production is forecast to be down some 10% year on year - while we may see some activity at higher prices in the short-term I think it will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are talking longer term. China is also talking prices of $30 which is $3/4 higher than last year but have some $3 frt advantage versus Newcastle. Gameplan We are currently a total of 2.4 million mt short ARA (1 million API2 / 1.4 million SECA) with the bulk being in back end of this year. We will continue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has some further downside from where we are today - the mkt has merely sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on prices if the stock situation does not improve in ARA - currently a 13 day lineup in Rotterdam. There are reports of Siberian type weather heading our way which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a significant impact. We are busy looking for any opportunity to sell out of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from the Armada of coal which is due to arrive. Psychology shud create downward pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to buy in some our deferred short sub $30 RBCT equivalent. Meanwhile we are working to sell 3-5 year agreements with several utilities while the mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range. We are also talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward. In the Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering anything further forward. Rgds Jez

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 04/2001 Highlight Cape market continues to fall but probably too fast and too early by most players  Asia will be back from holiday Monday and market is expecting rates to stabilise by end of next week.  We are currently evaluating taking another cape on short period or fixing a COA with a distressed owner for our Q2 cargoes out of RBCT or Colombia or both.  The average earnings for a cape has fallen from a high of $25,000 in November to $18,500 today.  Pierre is in Japan next week and should get a good feel as to what the Japanese steel mills are up to and what kind of opportunities are out there for us to concentrate on. Panamaxes as anticipated are very difficult to read with close to zero Far East biz. Atlantic very short term has slight imbalance of tonnage but backed by very good USDA corn sales yesterday, the grain will start to role by end Feb. Paper rates have remained stagnant again lacking real physical input, nearbys marginally easier forwards flat neglected. Strategy will either be to bear spread where nearby premiums are good or bide our time and buy Q2 dips or calls. The story out of Bocimar this week is that they view this year as being definitely weaker than last year and that they feel it should average around $15,000 to $17,000 for the year ( which is still a good market for shipping ) and at those levels, they are happy to sit back and watch.   Furthermore, last week CMB ( parent company of Bocimar ) released their earnings for cal 00.  Their Dry bulk division made 60 million Euro and their tanker division made 60 million as well.  These are very good numbers for their dry bulk division taking into account the incredible rise in bunkers last year ( cost of fuelling the ships ) and the fact that their ships were often at anchor and not generating revenues. On the funny side of things, Coeclerici is having their yearly audit by Arthur Anderson and AA has discovered that although Coeclerici makes money trading FFA's, they lack proper daily position reports and models to value options.  As a result, I got a call from Koert ( head shipping at Coaclerici ) asking for our assistance as AA had mentioned to them that they should talk to us about our systems and procedures.  Being that Coeclerici is our biggest counterpart, we jumped on the opportunity to assist and Andy James is being sent to genoa Tuesday for a one day tutorial about risk controls and procedures while trying at the same time to better understand how Coeclerici values deals, which needless to say should help us in the future when negotiating with them.

FYI, attached is a very complete 4-page summary of the Dabhol situation.  No action needed on your part---information only 
Wade, Bill & Neil, Attached please find a summary compilation of the various issues and discussions that occured on the Dabhol project status update call that was presented to the LNG vessel interests.  I initially put this together as a way of organizing my notes, as well as communicating the latest status to Mark Haedicke and Alan Aronowitz in EWS/EGM Legal, who have asked to be kept advised of developments affecting the LNG contracts.  However, in discussions during this morning's Dabhol project lawyers' call, the issue was raised whether any written record of the discussions would be sent on to the shiplenders or the Greenfield sponsors.   I offered to make this summary available to the group if it would be of any assistance, my offer was promptly accepted, and that's why you see all the ""cc"" names in the address line above. Of course, this summary is derived from my notes and somewhat contemporaneous recollections of the call, and as such I'm quite open to any suggested revisions to ensure the record is set as straight as possible. Kind regards, Dan

following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty's authorization to enter into the agreement.  these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements. the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then claims that it was not a valid contract.  in our case, they are only hedging.  we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front.  therefore they will not attempt to make this claim.  even if they did, our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout. the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back.  seems like a 5 second decision to me. is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form?  by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these

Dear Mr. Shankman, Thank you very much for your quick reply.  Attached is my resume.  I highlight the relevant skills in the summary.  The position is with the EES MMC EAST department / WHOLESALE, RETAIL & COMM, ENRON ENERGY SERVICES. It was posted on Dec. 11, but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on the internet, it is open. Look forward to hearing your comments / suggestions. Regards, Rina 
Yikes!  That girl's mother sounds like a real problem.  I'm not sure how I would have handled it.  How's school going?  Any plans for the weekend? Alma Martinez@ENRON 01/26/2001 11:36 AM 
What happened? Here's a story...as I was waiting at the bus stop (7:35am) to go to school, a lady approached me and asked if I'd make sure her daughter got on a certain bus.  The mother was running late for work and could not wait.  I couldn't say no...so Nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and I waited for the bus.  It was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus. On top of  things, I had quiz at 8am.  Which I then realized I missed.  I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own.  I asked her if she had any relatives that  would want to know of her whereabouts.  I called her grandmother and explained things to her.  Pretty strange...aye. A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her, but I couldn't do it.  Finally, I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school (8:30am).  There were only 15 minutes left of class. I stayed for the remainder of the lecture. After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived.  I told the bus driver where to drop her off.  I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure.  And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe. 
Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well. Thanks.  Jeff Jana Giovannini 01/26/2001 10:51 AM

All, The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in advance for your cooperation. Thank you, Jana

Great job gentlemen!  This deviation shows that Eco definitely has a significant amount of option value which can be exploited with quick reactions and favourable market movements. Eric Wayne Perry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 25/01/2001 00:20 
Finally completed tonight Net to Enron LNG Marketing Company - $ 272,000 ( $0.10/ mmbtu ) Net to Eco  about $3,300,000   ( Enron 50% share about $ 1,650,000 ) Enron total gain not counting  ENA's trading desk margin is $1,922,000 Not bad for a single cargo. Wayne

Thanks for the email.  Can you fax or email a  resume to me.  After I review, I'll reply with more info. Regards, Jeff RusAmArts@aol.com 01/26/2001 10:40 AM 
Dear Mr. Shankman, I obtained your name from the Penn Alum Network.  Sorry if this email is a bit long.  I came across a listing for a position with Enron in NY and am highly interested in applying for it. But, I would like to ask your advice regarding the approach I should take. When I was an undergraduate at Penn (Wharton & CAS), I started my own fertilizer trading company.  With zero capital and zero contacts in the industry, I built up a company with $ 15 mil in revenues and clients all over the world.  I personally developed relationships with clients like ConAgra, Transammonia, Mitsui and numerous others in Latin America and Europe. Six years ago, outside factors forced me to join my family business, which is in the entertainment industry.  Now, I am at a point where I can, and want, to return to what I originally did.  The Enron position describes the exact objectives I faced in developing my own company - selling to large commercial and industrial customers.  That is exactly what I did and did well.  But, I am afraid that if I send my resume to the Human Resource dept. they will overlook my early experience and will be confused why a Broadway producer is applying for the job. Do you happen to have any suggestions ?  Perhaps you might know someone in the New York office that I can meet with.  I am very interested in working for Enron and know that I posses the right skills.  I would greatly appreciate your advice. Thank you, Rina Kirshner 
Congrats!.  Will get you involved.  Jeff Cheryl Lipshutz 01/24/2001 05:44 PM 
Jeff, I met with you in the fall & mentioned that my son had applied early acceptance to Penn for undergraduate.  In the craze of year end closings, I neglected to let you know that he got accepted this past December.  He is very excited & I am excited that the stress level in our house over college apps is over!!!  In any event, I would like to take as active a role as possible on the Penn/Wharton recruiting team.  Please let me know how I can help.  Thanks! 
I knew you could.  I knew you could.  I knew you could. caroleg2@bellsouth.net 01/25/2001 10:14 AM

FYI. 
Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all responsibility going forward. I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation. Jeff

Jeff, Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well. Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always recommend buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Guys There has been tremendous interest expressed already by generators, developers, and utilities to just about every coal producer about locating plants at mines. Some are moving forward. The most advanced appear to be Peabody (into TVA in western KY) EnviroPower (permitting three sites in Ky and Indiana) and Anker (permitting a site in W.Va). All sites are near transmission. We can help locating sites , reserves and producers near transmission if we knew where the power needs are. Mike

Jeff, I trust all is well with you at the office. New Range Rover - I want to relay that I am privately informed Ford wish to accelerate the U.S launch of the new car. The UK launch is Sept. this year so reasonably may mean arrival here early 2002. Believing this to be accurate, this may relieve you of making any decision on Range Rover right now. Given your continuous search for ""good people"" and assuming your firm remains on the look-out for such people, I wish your permission to submit a resume of a colleague. This lady has excellent work-ethics, is an outstanding achiever with high energy and I believe, the suited attributes for the culture within Enron. I would hope this could be reviewed and sent onward to the relevant people who would invite her for an initial meeting in the near future. Please advise this is okay. Alan Alan D. Lucks

Ranendra:  I have been asked to begin the visa process for the above individual, located in India. I believe Mr. Shrivastava has been working as Assistant Manager with Enron since May 10, 1998.  If this is correct, we will be able to bring him into the US on an L1 intracompany visa under the Blanklet L for Enron. Can you please let me have an email address for him so that I can send him the required visa questionnaire to begin the process. Many thanks Margaret 713-345-5083

Hi Jeff- Hope things are well with you.  Classes started here this week and I'm still getting my schedule straigtened out.  Fortunately, I got into the Speculative Markets course.  However, I still need to choose a second finance class. I have until friday at 3 PM EST to choose between FIXED INCOME (dealing primarily with bond replication, fairly quantitative) and FUNDING INVESTMENTS (a broad examination of how firms finance investment with corporate securities). Which of the two do you think would help me out the most at Enron Global Markets?  Sorry for the short notice, but I just won the course permit tonight! Thanks, Matthew (267) 254-8985

No, I don't have that CD.  Can I crank it up so loud in my house, and piss off the neighbors?  I was out til about 11:30 last night.  (another two shift evening).  I'm pretty close  to the point where I can't drink after 10 ish on a school night.  Then, my neighbors house alarm went off for over 1/2 hour at 2:30.  Of course i called the police.  So i didn't wag my butt out of bed til 7:30. So first party may be feb 24.  any thoughts? I'd forward an email that has gone around a few times about your dad's girly friend, only then letting her know she's invited.  maybe tell her the wrong time. When are you off to san fran?  I have a wallet i'm trying to have made out there at some stuffy, but cool store off union square. Alexandra Saler@EES 01/17/2001 08:39 AM 
how are you?  do you have the Dido CD?  if not, I am going to get it for you.  I love it.  Beth called, and I am going to get the Palm.  She wanted me to get the Blackberry, which is the new awesome one, but of course it doesn't work on the Enron system. my dad just called and yelled at me again that he wants his bitch invited to my sister's shower.  he swore that she would not go, so the whole thing is so stupid.  I am out of invites.  can I send her an email about it?  this is the last thing that I have time to worry about. what is going on with you?  I am sure that you have another crazy day.  write back when you can!

Jeff: As Brian may have told you, I am now based in London.  I remain responsible for all BNP Paribas commodity brokerage. I am writing to inquire if Enron would be interested in comparing and discussing its experience in commodity exchanges, electronic markets and related matters. As you know, the exchange (IPE/NYMEX) business is on the verge of electronic transformation, your views on this and associated issues would be invaluable to us.  I have two objectives in mind for such a discussion.  Firstly, I wish to insure that BNP Paribas continue to provide Enron with a useful service. Secondly, perhaps there is potential of commercial collaboration in this area.

Jeff- I imagine you are following events in California with some degree of closeness.  Do you want to be included on these daily updates? RJ 
As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on for the California electricity crisis, state officials around Governor Gray Davis have toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be paid by the State of California. One problem on that front is still how much producers want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and his aides want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best way to determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term contracts. Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This week's legislative activities in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to finance power purchases after utility bankruptcy. 1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices was bought from themselves. But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part of any potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to use state credit to eliminate the ""risky debt"" premium that PG&E and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In return he is demanding that the companies prepare to ""share the

Jeff, I will find out the details on this end and take the necessary steps to correct. DCL 
Hi Drew, hope the London digs are working out! I have a HR problem that we need to address immediately.  Today we let Britta Dinndahl go.  Her termination was a case study in how to screw up a termination.  She was let back onto the trading floor where she called and email people telling them about her termination.  I understand from Chris Mahoney that (neither Nigel nor) Yvonne Scoroer was ready to handle this today, even though they had been briefed many times about her upcoming termination.  It wasn't until early afternoon that I called Phillipe Bibi to tell him of her termination, when she was taken off system access. In addition Yvonne has had Erik Hansen's contract for over three weeks and has not produced paper for Erik to sign.  It was my hope to have him under contract before the bonus period.  Further Jen Fraser was trying to hire Andrew Hill as a new employee for the Fundamentals group in London, and on three occasions Yvonne told Jonny Palmer that she would get an offer letter to him ""today"".  It took three weeks. Obviously these are extremely serious lapses, and I do not want Yvonne involved in any more Enron Global Markets.  Cindy and Shanna have done a heroic job for us in the U.S. and they have been extremely frustrated with their counterparts in London. Thanks for addressing this issue. Jeff
