Vince, I have added a lot of material to ""fill in the wholes"" and would like your reaction to the current draft.  I am still not very happy with the risk management segment (primarily as a result of my own lack of knowledge) so please read it carefully and get me your comments. I plan to let Don Chew (the editor) take a look at it to give us his guidance toward a successful draft. Hope you are having a great day and tremendous start to the new year. Your friend john p.s.

Alex, No problem. Vince Alex Huang@ENRON 01/11/2001 05:12 PM 
Vince, I was brought to my attention that an interesting Real Option conference is taking place in March 27-28. I would like to attend this conference if possible. Thanks. Alex 
Osman, George  Posey asked for a call. 
Hi, Vince, Please see attached file for an overview of all TRS deals and please be advised of any revisions. Thanks! Li 
Shirley, Please put it on my calendar. Vince 
As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote aggressive ideas. Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation. Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321. 
Shirley, Please, set up a phone interview with him. I think both Zimin and Stinson should talk to him. Vince 
Pavel, We shall talk to him. He looks like a very qualified candidate. Vince 
I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job. I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics society at the University of Houston. The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel. Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview. Vince Kaminski 
I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the SIAM Workshop last Friday. I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly for the oil and gas pipeline industry. I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline simulation industry would be a plus. Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for. Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with my qualifications in their group. Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting experience.  Publications are available on request. I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email. Thank you for your time.

ps. The meeting with Berney is set at 9:30 am, Tuesday 1/16. His assistant is trying to locate a conference room. Alex 
Steve, Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the code. Regarding Tanya's attitude. Just a few points. 1. I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work and she does not have the necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help. It's not that the work is beneath her. 2. Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston. 
Christie, I have two persons in my group helping me with the Wharton and Rice projects. By the way, the project I gave to Rice students is exactly the same as the project for Wharton. We shall see who is better. Their names are Li Sun  and Kenneth Parkhill. Can we invite them to the dinner on the 18th and to the meetings on Friday? 
Martin, Please, ask Steve to call your office. I may be late on Friday. I don't have to be present at this conference call. Please, talk about your potential involvement and if takes a trip to London it's OK with me. Vince 
Guys I've booked a room for a phone conference with you at 8am Friday.  Please advise of the number to call if not Vince's office. Steve

Dear Vince: Happy New Year. Does Enron have a program for hiring summer interns?  My daughter Candice Kao is a freshman at Mount Holyoke College.  She has a good quan aptitude and quite meticulous.  She is looking for summer intership in Houston.  So if you know such a program existing, please let me know. She is in town for the semester break if there is such a program, may be she can visit with someone there to have an interview. With best regards,  Ed 
Peter, I forwarded your resume with my recommendation to two senior executives in our Transportation and Storage Group.

Molly, Sandeep Kohli called last night.  We decided to transfer Anshuman for the 6-month trial period and then extend his assignment to a permanent employment if necessary. For Sandeep Kohli it's a permanent transfer, effective immediately. Some local opposition to poaching of good people.

Vince, Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk to Jeff Shankman on Monday. Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava, who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice. I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would be a good number to call you on. I look forward to working with the team in Research. Thanks again, Regards, Sandeep.

Steve, Friday morning is fine. What about 8:00 a.m.? Vince Steven Leppard 01/09/2001 11:07 AM 
Vince Marco is only available for a meeting on Friday of this week to discuss transmission modelling.  Please advise of your availability. Thanks, Steve 
Denise, No problem. We shall prepare a short presentation to address these issues. Vince Kaminski Denise Furey@EES 01/09/2001 11:12 AM 
I hope you have seen the email below.   Do you have any problem with what Jeremy has asked you or your group to address.     Is there anything that you want us to supply to you to assist you? 
I believe all of you received a request from Jeremy Blachman to hold the afternoon of January 10th open for an off-site to discuss the manner in which RAC and Research assess/test the credit quality of EES transactions.   I realize that RAC and EES have had many discussions as to the methodology, but it might be helpful for all of us to understand the actual derivation of some of analysis.    Please call me with any questions or comments at ext # 30349. The agenda will be as follows: 12:00 - 1:00 Lunch 1:00 - 3:30   Presentations 3:30 - to close  Discussion RAC/Research Presentations The following topics would be of interest to EES: 1 -  The derivation of default probabilities including  (Research) - - a discussion of the actual mathematical process, - - the analytics behind why these computations are deemed the best for Enron, - - a comparison to historic default rates and why they differ (in respect to actual default rates, shape of the cumulative default curves etc. 2 -  The volatilities which are used to determine possible loss scenarios for the commodity portion of EES deals including (Research) - - the selection of curves - - the application of those curves to the actual credit reserve model and - - why these particular tests are applicable to our products. 3  -  The recovery rates used in the credit reserve model.   How are these figures derived? (RAC) 4  -  How RAC and Research have adjusted the credit reserve model to accommodate unusual aspects of the deal including  (RAC) - - promotion payments, - - accounts receivable - - committed capital - - and other factors EES also understands that some of you may be familiar with our processes, however, there are perhaps areas that you would like to understand more fully.   Please tell us what you would like to hear from us. Also, RAC has sent us the credit reserve model and I have seen completed models.   Perhaps prior to our meeting on Wednesday,  someone from RAC and/or Research could sit with me and someone from Phil Layton's group and go through the process of how the various pieces are put together. 
Dennis, Thanks for you message. I shall send you more information regarding the dinner later this week. Christie Patrick, who is in charge of our university liaison unit, is making arrangements for the evening  at the Enron Field. Hopefully, we shall be able to combine dinner with a game.

Vince, ? I can offer you 12.5% off of your order for 50 books (we originally spoke  to Habiba about setting up a 50% discount?but Enron would have to order a minimum of 200 books.??since the?change over, nothing has been  set up on this).? ? Let me know if I should go ahead with the invoice. ? Thanks, Julie 
Hello Shmuel, Thanks for your message. The end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were extremely busy and I could not focus on PSERC issues. I shall consult a few people in Enron on this subject and get in touch with you. Our concern right now is that the results of research are widely shared with our competition. I am out on the 19th, but the 20th would work for me. I would be glad to cover the cost of your Austin to Houston trip. Regarding your son. The Analyst / Associate program will interview again on the campus in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him. ""Shmuel Oren"" <oren@ieor.berkeley.edu> on 12/19/2000 01:40:02 PM

Vince, Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk to Jeff Shankman on Monday. Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava, who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice. I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would be a good number to call you on. I look forward to working with the team in Research. Thanks again, Regards, Sandeep.

Dear Vince: ? After a very great deal of thought, I have decided  to stick it out with El Paso. ? Please be assured that this exercise was not a  ""fishing expedition"" to extract concessions from El Paso.? Rather, it is  simply that, although I continue to harbor doubts about some of El Paso's  methods and about the people running the business, I have concluded that two  months is not enough time to fully judge the company.? I feel that I have  not yet given El Paso (or myself for that matter) a fair chance.? After  all, if I disagree with the way the business is run, I should regard that as an  opportunity to effect changes and not an excuse to run away. ? Please extend my sincerest thanks and apologies to  all those who worked so hard over the holidays to produce the offer: David  Oxley, Sheila Walton, and especially Norma Villarreal. ? And thanks also to you Vince for your patience,  humor, and good advice.? As I've said before, I consider it an honor to be  able to call you a colleague and friend. ? With Best  Regards, Grant.

Jeff, A few comments on the model: 1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like to discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of our insights to the consultant. In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the details and in the inputs and calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results depending on the quality of inputs. 2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We were told that you would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person. 
Vince/Stinson, Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as well as the revised statement that can be made to press. The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating in homes, and commercial establishments. Hope ths helps. Regards, Sandeep. 
snapshot+performance data for model development 
snapshot+performance data for model development Amitava, Thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its scope.  I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that we'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust model off more comprehensive data to start with. Cheers, Scott Amitava Dhar 26/04/2001 21:23 
snapshot+performance data for model development Mike, Scott, Eric, After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows: We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights. For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts: Input snapshots           Performance 1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end   12 month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000 1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end    12 month end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000 1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end     12 month end performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000 1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end    12 month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000 We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ days delinquency on any trade credit. We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for analysis. Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly. Regards, Amitava

Vince, I would like to meet with you or someone in your group to discuss some of the investment ideas and structures we are exploring.  How is your group structured these days?  Who would be best for me to meet?  Might you be available for lunch next week?  I will have my assistant contact you. Thank, Kevin Garland 
George, We shall be able to accommodate one or two extra people in the first round. We shall be glad to repeat the seminars starting soon for a bigger group.

Vince: Jim has called twice today.  Jeff Shankman was supposed to have sent you his resume.  Do you have it?  If not, I can email him and ask for an electronic copy. Let me know. Shirley 
Chonawee, This was perfectly all right. As a matter of fact I expect and encourage the members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else) on any subject. I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation of ability to think independently and having the courage of one' s convictions. Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything. The only way we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and the company) is by having open communication.  In Enron, facts are friendly. By the way, it was an excellent presentation. Vince Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON 01/04/2001 03:10 PM 
Hi Vince, I am sorry for correcting on the revenue of the different auctions. Vickrey 1961 showed that all 4 kinds of auctions would yield the same expected revenue to the auctioneer. (Dutch, English, first price-sealed bid, and second-price sealed bid.) In fact, the selling price is equal to the valuation of the second highest bidder. For example, in Vickrey auction, everyone bids at his own valuation. Hence, the winner pays the valuation of the second highest bidder. In English auction, the second highest valuation bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation. Hence, the winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder. Thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions. -chonawee

Ashley, Thnaks. I shall attend the reception. I shall ask Shirley to set up a meeting with you to discuss spring events on campus. Vince Ashley Baxter@ENRON on 01/04/2001 04:01:01 PM 
Hello Vince I wanted to forward the following invitation to you.  We are putting the Technologists through an orientation which includes a few days with the Analyst program - and the following is one of the events that they have scheduled on Jan. 16th.  I wanted to forward to you as more of an FYI since we do not have any Cal Berkeley candidates starting on Jan. 8th.  Also - we are starting to set some of the events on campus for the Spring - so we should probably get together soon.  Please let me know what works best for you! Thanks, Ashley 
Jeff, We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the numbers you have requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on the power situation in India published by The Financial Times. The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting millions of people. One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due to  power shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost of power produced by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230 million people. The second article is Enron specific. Vince ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001 By ANGUS DONALD Tens of millions of people were left without electricity in northern India yesterday after a power grid breakdown. Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and most parts of the capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply expected to be restored by the end of the day, according to power grid officials. The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assocham), a 
FYI Vince 
Valery, I may be in Dallas in the next few weeks. I shall probably come to Dallas one Friday. I shall let you know well in advance. Vince ""Valery Kholodnyi"" <vkholod1@txu.com> on 01/04/2001 08:29:37 AM 
Dear Dr. Kaminski, I would like to apologize for the delay responding, I was on vocation. Thank you very much for your interest in my work and for your suggestion to meet for lunch/dinner. I will be truly happy to do so. In this regard could you please let me know what day might be convenient for you. Since I am going to fly from Dallas, I would like, if possible, to plan it in advance. I look forward to hearing from you and to seeing you soon. Sincerely, Valery Kholodnyi 
Michele, I have defined the project for the students. It's   one project that is divided into three sections. Feel free to stop by to talk about it. Vince 
Vasant, This is the presentation. Sorry for the delay. Vince

Hopefully, you will never need to USE this information, but it looks like something vital to KNOW. Bob Brooks The following is forwarded for your information from: Phillip L. Stephenson Director of (Coast Guard Auxiliary) Eighth District Eastern Region Tel: 502-625-7543 / 1-800-217-4420 Fax: 502 625 7545 E-mail: PStephenson@dirauxlouisville.uscg.mil WebPages: www.uscg.mil/d8/diraux/8er/index.htm This is excellent info considering that the average age of an Auxiliarist is 58.5 years. ITS WORTH PASSING ON - PLEASE REMEMBER IT. Let's say it's 6:15 p.m. and you're driving home (alone of course), after an unusually hard day on the job. You're really tired, upset and frustrated. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw. You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your home, unfortunately you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far. What can you do? You've been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the course neglected to tell you how to perform it on yourself. HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE (Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article seemed in order.) Without help, the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let up until help arrives, or until the heart is to be beating normally again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. Tell as many other people as possible about this, it could save their lives!

Sally, I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request. They renewed their request for Enron's participation. What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the project. My recommendation is to forget it. Vince 
Dear Vince, Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of Enron's participation in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed Enron's participation in the project with your colleagues? Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use. With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to have Enron participate in the study. I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful. Best regards, Theresa Sanders Director of Business Development Alliance of Energy Suppliers Edison Electric Institute Tel: 202-508-5183 - EEI metrics-short list.xls - ebrochure.doc - RiskBenc.ppt

simulations Everybody, we were talking for a while about using non-normal distributions in the Monte-Carlo simulations in our VAR model. I put together some suggestion regarding this. The text is under O:\_Dropbox\Tanya\non_normal_logs.doc Look through this 3 page document, and let me know what you think, please. Tanya 
Bill, Attached are the spreadsheet for the Credit Exposure model and the XLL file. We have performed some tests and the numbers looked reasonable. However, more extensive testing using realistic data is needed. We would like to pass the model to you so you can have someone check it more extensively and compare the model  with what you are using. Also, please kindly inform me of any suggestions to improve the model as well as any problems you may find. I can be reached at 31631. Best, Alex

Amitava, Can you schedule a brainstorming session with Vasant, Tanya, Rakesh, myself and Ben (if possible)? What about the trip on Monday. Has it been scheduled? Vince Amitava Dhar@ENRON 01/03/2001 08:30 AM 
The following is a good summary from Vasant about the projects and what is ahead of us. Ben, please let me know when things are ready; I can plan my trip accordingly. Thanks, Amitava EnronCredit.com is working on 3 main models --- the FMC model, the Placement model, and the Movement model. FMC Model : provides credit default swap price curves for 16 ratings with 33 industry offsets.  Each day, this model takes the previous day's trader curves and adjusts them for the movement in Bloomberg yields and observed swap prices. Placement Model : uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using dummified ranges for Market Capitalization, Liquidity, KMV Score, etc.  One main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade names.  Alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for separate sunsets of names. Movement Model : provides an alert system for news.  This is under development. Current involvement of Houston Research Group members is in the development/modifications of the Placement Model, especially in thinking through the various single vs multi model approaches.  We can help in the brainstorming for better models for subsets.  One main project right now is to get a separate model for subsidiaries, and to exclude subsidiary names from the main regression. Value-at-risk is based on historical variance-covariance approach. The portfolio model is under development. Agenda for Houston Research Group members : Once sufficient data is collected, start reviewing for potential analytic relationships. Get weekly updates from London, and provide feedback. Plan on a trip if the work warrants it, once the agenda is fairly well drawn out, and data is available for analysis.

Greg, As a follow up. We are talking to Jay Webb today about the data we can get from the Enron OnLine system to develop an early warning system  for automated crude trading. By the way, it was a good catch. You left us red faced. 
To Keith $4676.18 
Margaret, The forward power and gas price curves, unlike NYMEX futures prices, are not publicly available and are a closely guarded secret of the trading desks. We have no authority to release them without getting the head of the trading desk involved. 
Jeff and John, I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us their progress implementing risk management practices. I shall arrange the meeting and get RAC involved. Would you like to meet them for a short courtesy meeting (5 - 10  minutes)? Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned (given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8, at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting. 
Zimin, I have talked to Alex about it. I don't think that the additional seminars will crowd out the brown bag lunches. The seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and have very limited, or zero, exposure to energy markets. For most members of the group it should be the piece of cake. Brown bag lunches are not that time intensive, except for the speaker. Plus, we ran out of days  available for lunch meetings. Vince 
Vince, This is a brief summary of last year's Friday Brown Bag Lunch Option Pricing series. We had about 15 lectures, given by the following people: Grant, Stinston, Vasant, Krishna, Zimin, Maureen, Clayton, Paulo, Chonawee, myself, and some outside speakers. We were able to attract some outside audience as well. Overall the response is quite encouraging and we have planned to continue it. In light of the presently scheduled seminars on ""Energy Derivatives"", it seems our Friday schedule will be too crowded if we have seminars on ""Energy Derivatives"" on two Fridays and FBBLOP on other Fridays. What's your suggestion? Should we discontinue the FBBLOP ? We also have scheduled January 19 for Tom Halliburton's visitor Leon Lasdon from UT Austin to talk on non-linear programming. Should we cancel it? Best, Zimin & Alex 
Rick, I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us their progress implementing risk management practices. Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for banks (you or David Port, Bill Bradford, research)? Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned (given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8, at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting. I shall also contact Jeff Shankman and John Nowlan to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them. 
Osman, Kevin Kindall is working on the methods for operational risk. Please, schedule a meeting with him and  Tanya (myself included). Vince Osman Sezgen@EES 01/02/2001 02:02 PM 
Vince, I am sorry that I had to miss the staff meeting today. I am working on the PremiumPower issues--trying to set up a meeting with Global Markets. I read their Business Plan and will talk to Vasant to update him on the types of products they are developing. Another set of issues is related to including business risk (non-market risk) into the VAR calculations. Several groups here need such methodologies. Can we set up a brainstorming session when your schedule permits? Happy New Year, Osman 
Dear Mr. Nur Azmin Abu Bakar, Thanks for your prompt reply. Please, let us know how many members of your team will visit Enron. I look forward to our meeting on February 8. Vince Kaminski azminab@petronas.com.my on 01/02/2001 06:38:33 PM 
Dear Kaminski, Happy New year and thank you for the reply.  We are honored to have lunch with you and your team however we have another appointment at 2.30p.m. Regards Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com on 03/01/2001 07:38:19 AM

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor. Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves in May, has yet to be named. The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than standard VAR. In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated in the Basle II capital accord proposals. Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial institutions is _151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30% of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.

John, I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts. I could not agree more. Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional contribution. Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally. 
John, Thanks a lot. 
Stinson, Thanks a lot for so much work you have done for the simulation model. It seems that our work will make an impact on EOL trading, that is very exciting. Could you e-mail me the spreadsheet model so that I can catch up with the changes you have made ? I read a few books during this vocation. Especially a stochastic processes book, I finished the entire book.  The queueing theory is very fascinating, and hopefully we can apply the theory to a real EBS project. I will take my family out to see the Nature Bridge Caverns near San Antonio tomorrow. See you on Tuesday. Happy New Year ! Zimin Stinson Gibner 12/27/2000 08:09 PM

Shirley, I think it's a growing problem of junk mail that is being sent indiscriminately to everybody. Sometimes it comes from legitimate institutions, sometimes it represents scams. I got a message today about diamonds in Sierra Leone. Vince Shirley Crenshaw 01/02/2001 08:16 AM 
Vince: Do you know who this is?  I have been getting this, but don't know why or who he is. Does it sound reputable? 
12/28/00 The markets finally took a breather, as the light volume seemed to indicate the tax loss season was mostly over, and investors were enjoying their holidays and trying to forget a bad year for the markets. The week was pretty god, with perhaps some last minute tax selling on Friday. It will be interesting to see how next week fares. I think tech will continue to suffer through the first half of the year. The earnings are not likely to improve until sometime in the second half. At that point, year to year comparisons will be more favorable. There will be some successes, as so many have been beaten down too far. Energy looks strong right now, but I would be cautious as we get past the winter and the gas price comes down to a more reasonable level. Merrill Lynch now predicts fed cuts of 100 basis points by the end of the summer. These cuts will create a strong emotional push to the market, even in the face of lower earnings. Merrill Lynch is also predicting a GDP growth of 2.9%, down from the previous forecast of 3.3%. This certainly would qualify as a ""rough"" if not ""hard"" landing. They expect the GDP growth in the second half of 2001 to rise at a 3.5%-4% rate. They predict the strongest earnings to come from Health and Energy at about 14%, with Tech and Utilities at 10%. Some of the market weakness and economy concern could stem from the statements being made by the new Bush administration. They want to be sure the public is aware of the slowing economy, so the issue will be seen as one they inherited, not created. They don't want to be seen as the ones who messed up the great boom. They also want justification for the tax cut plan they had proposed, and a weaker economy is certainly a good reason to stimulate the economy with cuts. There are a number of tax law changes for 2001. The new capital gains rates for investments held over five years begins- the new rates are 8% and 18% versus 10% & 20%. The deductible interest on student loans rises from $2000 to $2500. The rate for auto business miles is rising from 32.5 cents/mile to 34.5. The expense deduction for business equipment in the first year rises from $20k to $24k. The exemption on unearned in come for children has been raised to $750, from $700. The second $750 in income is taxed at the child's rate, up from $700. So now there is $1500 of preferential taxation for kids under 14, up from $1400.

FROM: COL. DAGOGO KALU TEL/FAX 448453342783 ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO REQUEST FOR AN ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, With due respect and knowledge of your good reputation, I decided to contact you for this matter that need urgent attention.  I am COL. DAGOGO KALU.  I was the commandant of the West African Peace keeping Force & Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) until I sustained a very serious injury that put me off the military camp for about 3 months now.  Honestly, I have full trust for your honesty hence I write this letter to you. During our recent mission to Sierra Leone, a diamond rich West African country to cushion the war between the rebels and the ruling Government, we ran into 2 boxes (consignment) right inside a thick jungle where we believed was a hide out of the rebels.  As we opened the boxes, one that is smaller contains numerous sizes of raw diamond.  The Bigger box contains about US $15.2 Million, which we believed to be the total amount of diamond sold at that period of time by the rebels before we invaded the place. Myself and my two other colleagues took the boxes away.  I took the bigger box containing the US $15.2 million to Cotonou Benin Republic which is the nearby country and deposited it with one Security Company for safe keeping to enable me think wisely on what to do with the money.  The smaller box containing the raw diamond I gave it to my other 2 colleagues, which they accepted in good faith. A month after this, the rebels lunched a counter-attack on us where I sustained a very serious gun shut wound on my right leg.  A lot of our boys died but few survived.  At this moment, I am receiving medical treatment here in London.  This is why I need your help urgently. I need a Foreign Company I will present as the Beneficiary of the huge amount and also pay in the money into their account.  Your Bank account must be a good one where we shall not pay much as tax.  You shall also serve as the general overseer and guardian of this fund and all the investment of this money will be under your care until I recover fully. I will give you all the details of the transaction immediately I get your response.  You will also get a suitable percentage (%) as your share.  All the documents of the DEPOSIT OF THE MONEY are intact with my wife.  I have already finalized this arrangement with the Security Company so there is no problem at all. Please you can reach me through my Direct Tel/Fax No: 448453342783 where I am receiving treatment.  In your reply, state clearly your direct telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and more confidentiality. Further details will be given to you once I hear from you. I await your urgent response soonest. Best regards, COL. DAGOGO KALU _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor. Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves in May, has yet to be named. The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than standard VAR. In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated in the Basle II capital accord proposals. Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial institutions is _151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30% of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.

Sheila, I am forwarding you a message I received a few days ago. I want to ask you for advice how to handle this case. My first  reaction was to ignore it. The longer I think about it, the more convinced I become that some action is required. Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a female employee was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar cases, courts  subsequently found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such complaints. The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is immaterial. If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double standard in handling sexual harassment cases. My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and sexual harassment prevention class. Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case. Vince 
Vince- I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

Dear Vince, Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.? Let's plan on having you speak for our Gamma Iota Sigma dinner on the evening of 2/23.? It is my understanding that you are going to be in town anyway for John Martin's ""new economy"" seminar.? Will you be needing a hotel accommodation for that evening?? If so, please let me know and I will have my secretary arrange accommodations for you. Concerning class presentations, I am curious when whether we can try to arrange a date.? I am teaching two undergraduate sections of a business risk management course from 11-12:20 and 12:30-1:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays this spring.?? I also am teaching a graduate version of the same course from 3:30-4:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but when you come I will probably have you speak to the undergraduate classes and have my graduate students attend either of those sessions.? The spring semester starts January 9 and ends May 1, and the following dates are already taken for other speakers, exams, or spring break: Thursday, February 15 - Midterm exam 1 Tuesday, March 6 and Thursday, March 8 - no class (spring break) Thursday, March 15 - presentation on risk adjusted discount rate methodologies by Dr. Richard Derrig, Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts Tuesday, April 3 - Midterm exam 2 Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to schedule a presentation.? Considering the fact that the presentation would be scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.

Dear Vince, Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate  and graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU classes. Thank you for your consideration of this request.?

Here is a short note on potential research with Wharton.  Please review and edit and then we can send some indication to the Wharton guys.    ---------- The objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take, and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure.  In particular, one can view Enron as a hierarchy of companies, and assuming we can separately quantify the risks of each unit, what framework would one use to analyze risk at Enron? A related question is how one should represent risks in the different units?  Risks may be of different types --- short-term volatility risk, catastrophic risk, liquidity risk, etc --- what should one focus on for a first cut? Another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance both at the unit level and the enterprise level, and relate the decision to get insurance to the cost/benefit of insurance.

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade. I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with the other Plan presentation I had sent you.

Hi Vince: Lance's telephone # is:  (512) 280-5052. 
Steve, My phone number is 281 367 5377. We shall be very glad to join you to celebrate the holidays. Vince Enron Technology 
Nick, Thanks for your message. My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays and  this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford. I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend. Let's plan to meet for dinner then. I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research project. We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it. It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection of the research topics. We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns. Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall welcome him with open arms. I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford. Vince Nick Bambos <bambos@stanford.edu> on 12/20/2000 12:14:40 PM 
Hello Vince and Stinson, First of all, BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!! If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together some time to have dinner. I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial! We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into the ""problem/opportunity generation environment."" That really helps the student to develop a realistic vision about their research. Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter, say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of course you could visit us before that too. With my WARMEST WISHES, Nick 
Valery, I am interested in receiving the preprint. On another note, I would be glad to meet you for lunch/dinner sometimes during the next few weeks. Please, let me know what would be the best time to meet.

Dear Dr. Kaminski, I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely yours, Valery Kholodnyi Manager of Quantitative Analysis Research and Analytics Group TXU Energy Trading PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power: 1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes and Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00, July 2000. 2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000. 3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000. 4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at Two Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000. 5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000. As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes. 
Vince, FYI.  This is something the team has been working on with Krishna. Regards, Sandeep. 
Jim, I am attaching below a small draft note prepared by Anshuman on LNG hedging. It talks of two products: (1) Volumetric Options (where we buy a call on 100% of the volumes and sell a put on 50% of the volumes to finance the call), and (2)  Ratio Derivative where we buy two calls at a higher price, and sell one at a lower price to finance it.  This is not one that the traders agree to, since at the upper price, the calls bought are just at the money, while the sold call is in the money, and will cost the seller. Hence, only Option 1 is useful.  It could provide risk mitigation in the high price scenario, while allowing some participation in low prices.  To test it, we used March 2001 period.  To have it cost neutral, we would buy a call at $26, and sell the put at $25.15. As we bounce these ideas, I think it is very important that we work closely with the Global Markets group.  The team on the ground knows the contracts better, and maybe able to give you insights on what can be sold to MSEB. Would love to discuss the same with you. Regards, Sandeep.

Vincent, Congratulations on spearheading the Mind's Eye Madness event - it looks like quite a success.  My biggest disappointment is that I am leaving Enron this week and have been too busy to participate as much as I would like.  I have had continued interest in the work and presentations that Amy Oberg has done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may work. Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be worked out over the next few weeks.

John, In general, results are not too different from last day roll.    For ""no roll"" and ""roll same position"" strategies, the 2nd last day seems to outperform slightly more often. Let me know if you would like to 1) look at quarter to quarter earning volatility of these strategies or 2) look at effect of incorporating some transaction costs for rolling/liquidating positions. --Stinson Normal Roll No Roll  Fill Gap

Jim, Thanks a lot. It is difficult to find a better example example of commitment to Enron and to professional excellence than  our weather guys. Vince Jim Schwieger 12/21/2000 10:32 AM 
The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year. Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast. They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve an ""A+"".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our success. Thanks,  Jim Schwieger 
Thanks, I shall attend. Vince Kaminski Tracy L Arthur 12/20/2000 04:20:35 PM

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade. I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with the other Plan presentation I had sent you. Look forward to touching base with you. Regards, Sandeep.

Hi, Vinice, Please see attached the informaiton regarding JEDI II. Li 
See if this works for you.  Let me know what else you might need. 
John, The updated model does not give answers too different from the earlier version.   The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls and correcting some of the roll dates. The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000 bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the 5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the position limit. 1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a trend, but 2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back when the market reverses. In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and 5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals. --Stinson Open to Close   Continuous trading 
Vince, I appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the last.  However, my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon and I wasn't sure I would get back to this before leaving tomorrow.  The only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro plus the addition of ""Unused information"" at the end of the document.  The unused stuff is made up of notes I made from Hamel, some news stories, press releases, and random thoughts.  We probably won't use any of this stuff but I wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful. The challenge we face at this stage (and where I can most use your help) is in documenting Enron's risk management functions in a meaningful way.  This may be best done through examples or in some other way.  I think that our audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed examples (even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don't interrupt the flow of the article.  If you'll make a pass at what you feel is appropriate I'll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what you are doing myself. Vince, I really am enjoying this learning experience.  You guys make a wonderful ""lab"". Sally and I are driving to Louisiana to pick up her mom tomorrow and then driving to New Orleans and back to Waco by Saturday.

Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive: The following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred Friday, December 15 1.  Energy Secretary Richardson issuance of an emergency order. (Richardson's statement and FPA Section 202(c) order is posted on DOE's Web site at: http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases00/decpr/pr00309.html ) 2.  FERC's 12/15/00 final order to fix California wholesale markets (FERC's Order can be viewed at http://www.eei.org/issues/news/cal1215order.pdf) California Supplies Ordered by Richardson o Richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to California ISO o Order is effective as soon as ISO certifies shortage, but ends 12/21/00, unless extended o Prices to be agreed to by supplier and ISO, or FERC will set rate later o FPA emergency power authority transferred to DOE in 1977 As he said he would on December 13, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson found ""an emergency exists in California by reason of the shortage of electric energy"" and issued an emergency order under section 202 (c) of the Federal Power Act (FPA) requiring listed generators and marketers to provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the California ISO.  In a statement, Richardson said the threat to the reliability of the California grid requires a long-term solution, but that in the short-term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts. The 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the ISO certifies to DOE that it has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing requested service to the ISO.  The ISO must inform each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time, the day before the services are needed.  The order directs the ISO to allocate, to the extent feasible, requested services among subject entities in proportion to each supplier's available excess power. The order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3:00 AM, Eastern Time, December 21, 2000, unless extended.  To continue to obtain supplies under this emergency authority, the ISO must re-certify the shortage to DOE headquarters every 24 hours. The terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers to the ISO ""are to be agreed to by the parties.""  If no agreement is reached, then under the FPA's emergency authority Secretary Richardson ""will immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination at a later date by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures, and will prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and reasonable.""  The authority of FERC to set rates for power supplied under emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do not agree to a rate is explicitly included in FPA Section 202(c).  The DOE Organization Act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section from FERC to DOE. The 76 entities identified in the order's attachment are all the entities that have provided power to the ISO over the last 30 days.  Those entities are ordered ""to make arrangements to generate, deliver, interchange, and transmit electric energy when, as, and in such amounts as may be requested by

FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules effective at= =20 the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman James=20 Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California=20 wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning= =20 ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission (CPUC). The agency also modified the effective period of the $150/MWh ""soft cap""=20 proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a=20 ""comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which=20 incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures"" must b= e=20 in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early nex= t=20 year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can= =20 be place by the May 1, deadline. ***Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolst= er=20 California's Supplies*** Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained= =20 power supply situation in California by issuing an order, pursuant to Secti= on=20 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to require generators and marketers to mak= e=20 power available to meet the state's electricity needs.  The emergency=20 directive requires that, if the California independent system operator (ISO= )=20 certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity, certain=20 suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have= =20 power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm= =20 customers. Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power= =20 exchange (PX) and the ISO over the last 30 days that have firm capacity=20 available would be subject to the order. Under the order, the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier=20 subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9:00 pm= =20 EST on the day before the requested service.  The ISO must, to the extent= =20 feasible, allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each=20 supplier's available power.  The price for the power provided pursuant to t= he=20 order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier.  If no= =20 agreement is reached, FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at = a=20 later date.   The order will remain in effect until 3:00 am EST on December= =20 21, 2000 unless modified. ***EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants' Mercury Emissions*** EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in a long-awaited announcement, indicated= =20 last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury=20 emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants.  The agency stated that it= =20 plans to propose new regulations in December 2003, and hopes to finalize ne= w=20 rules by December 2004. In the wake of the decision, EEI called on EPA to make certain that any=20 program to control utilities' mercury emissions be based on the best=20 scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi= c=20 health.  ""EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key=20 scientific and technological issues,"" said Paul Bailey, EEI Vice President,= =20 Environmental Affairs.  Given these uncertainties, EEI is disappointed that= =20 the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health=20 threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science,"" said Mr. Bail= ey. ""In the meantime, the electric power industry will continue to work with al= l=20 stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions= =20 from power plants may be needed, and how those cuts should be achieved,"" Mr= .=20 Bailey concluded.

Asset Summary The following is a structure diagram: Please let me know when you would like to meet to discuss these items.  Also, Alan Quaintance is the person who reviewed the Hawaii 125-0 docs, so if you have any questions regarding those docs, you will probably need to meet with him. Thank you! Connie Lee Manager Enron Broadband Services 713/345-8227 (W) 713/419-2728 (C) connie_lee@enron.net

Becky, The charges to Corp. go to RAC and are based on my projections of expected expenses. The charges are based on the following assumptions (percentages in the parenthesis show amount of time allocated by each person (group)) to RAC: 1. Value-at-Risk Group (VaR) MD (25%) VP (60%) Director (100%) 5 managers (100%) 2. Enterprise wide risk management Manager (100%) Associate (100%) Currently we hired (or will shortly hire)  4 managers for the VaR group. The expansion of the VaR group was planned based on the requests from RAC for more support. Vince 
Madam, I have a meeting with Corp tomorrow in reference to the intercompany billing to Corp.  They are concerned about Research allocation.  I need some back up to this billing.  Can you help me?  Can I get it by the end of the day to have it reviewed and ready for tomorrow?  Please let me know....  Thanx 
Becky, I am discussing these allocations with the appropriate groups within Corporate, as they will be the ones accepting/rejecting these charges.  I am forwarding this to the appropriate individuals within the Corp. departments for their review.  So, do not consider Corp as ""in agreement"" until you hear back from me.  I also reviewed what we are receiving in 2000 and I have a few questions relating to both 2000 and 2001: 1. What is ESource? 2. What is ENA Ops Direct? 3. What is ENA OCC Direct? 4. What is ENA CO 021?  Is this Vince Kaminsky's group?  The charges for 2000 have been about $16k and $20k to the RAC group, so at that rate, I would expect 2001 to be no more than $250k-$300k, but the plan amount you sent is $1.9MM.  I will need some detail on this. Thanks, Steve Becky Pham@ECT 12/14/2000 05:15 PM 
Attached is the 2001 PRELIMINARY inter-company billing.  ENA will be billing plan numbers for all departments except for External Legal and External Tax, which will be billed base on actual.  A quarterly review will be done to determine the variance between plan vs. actual amounts.  If the variance amount is material, we will adjust the billing to your Business Unit accordingly. If you have any questions, call me at 5-7094.  Please review this billing, and notify me with any questions by Wednesday, December 20, 2000; otherwise, it is assumed that you agree to the intercompany billing from ENA. You are the only person in your Business Unit receiving this invoice.  If this invoice needs to go to someone else in your business unit,  please forward to the correct person and can I be included in the forward e-mail?

Dzien dobry, Mam nadzieje, ze nic sie nie zmienilo i jestesmy umowieni na dziesiejszy lunch. Proponuje sie spotkac o godzinie 12.00 na parterze obok biurka ""security ladies"" (bo wiem gdzie to jest). Ubrany jestem w czarne spodnie, bezowe buty i szara bluze.

Gilian, No, we don't  additional need more data. I understand Stinson Gibner has already sent you a reply with his findings. Vince 
Vince, Was the data we provided sufficient to determine whether the Global Markets book administrator correctly utilized the spread option model?  Please let me know if there are any additional data requirements. Thank you again for your assistance. Gillian Boyer x30968 
Vince, Our goal is to validate that the Enron Global Market book administrators are accurately using the ""spread option model"" as developed by the Research Group.    To determine this, we would like to provide you with the inputs for a particular deal (as provided by a Global Markets book administrator) and have you recalculate the deal value.   We will then compare your results to the values calculated by Global Markets. Two Koch deals have been chosen due to their substantial P/L effect.  I have attached the deal data in two forms: (1) the spread option model that Kara Boudreau, Book Administrator EGM, provided and (2) an excel spreadsheet that isolates the 2 deals. If there is anything more that we could provide, please don't hesitate to call me at  x30968. Thank you so much for all of your help. Gillian 1. 2. 
Stinson, The spreadsheet below shows the allocations I made for EBS. The numbers in magenta show percentage allocations, Of course, Samir and Samer are gone, ad so is Roman. The problem is that once I give the percentages to accounting they become fixed for one year. 
Steve, Yes, I read it. I am going to talk about it with Ted Murphy and possibly Rick Buy. As you have correctly pointed out, the model validation issues cannot be handled  internally by Research. The problem is that everybody is swamped right now with PRCs and end-of-year issues. I don't think we shall send our  full  VaR model under any circumstances. We can offer to sell a reduced version based on RiskMetrics. By the way, our meeting Tuesday will start at 11:00  a.m., Houston time. Vince Steven Leppard 12/18/2000 04:25 AM 
Hi Vince - did you read this email I sent you?  We're waiting for some guidance! Shirley - is Vince around? Thanks, Steve 
Hi Vince James New from London Risk Mgt has asked me to sign off the computations in EnergyDesk.com for use in Oslo office's new system.  I'm a little uncomfortable with this since: 1. Sign off of models is something that I've been brought up to consider to be the domain of RAC.  They disagree in part (see below), which leads me to... 2. London Research is not the ""owner"" of Exotica, and we don't necessarily have the time/resource/expertise to audit Houston Research's code.  Indeed, can Research group sign off their own efforts?  By definition the originating group for a piece of code thinks it's OK, or they wouldn't have written it that way. 3. I'm concerned about Research group code being sold to external clients without Research involvement.  (I received a query a couple of weeks ago from an EnergyDesk.com guy, Jan Lillehammer, who said he was planning to sell our VaR system, and asked if he could have a copy!) I've tried to emphasise that we support Exotica for internal purposes only, and that our entire setup presupposes the presence of resident quants on the trading floor to support the tools that Research write. Your advice/guidance would be appreciated. All the best, Steve 
Mike, What do you think? I see pro's and con's. The argument against is that during PRCs people comment positively or negatively about a person and this is how the word is spread about an employee. Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC. Vince

Dave, I would like to recommend to you Sandeep Kohli who is likely to approach you regarding a position in your area. I have  been working with Sandeep for a number of years and I was always impressed with his skills, intelligence and mature, thoughtful approach to solving business problems. He is currently located in India (our DPC unit) and is looking for a permanent position with Enron in Houston for family reasons (his wife is from Houston and has a family here). Of course, there are some  other obvious factors affecting his decision.

Stinson and Vince, I finalized the presentation for John Lavorato, he said he is ready to present it  to Greg.  He is happy with the work we provided. I will be on vocation starting next week.  I attached the simulation models here in case that you need them.  The OC version deals with open-close trading and CC version deals with continuous trading. Should you have any questions, or need to run different scenarios, please call me at home.  Otherwise, I will see you next year. Merry Chrismas and Happy New Year ! Zimin

Dear Vince, Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.?

Considering the fact that the presentation would be scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.

Can you send me a copy of exit interview for Grant Masson? There is a special reason I need and I shall explain it to you in person. 4. What time next week would be good for lunch? I would be glad to invite you Molly and Ramona. What about Friday the 22nd? 
Anita, Shirley is out sick today. Can you, please, confirm my lunch with Bjorn Hagelman (Enron), 11.30 today (Friday). Please, ask him if he wants me to make reservations? If the answer is Yes, please, make a reservation for 2 at Damian's, 11:45. Vince

FYI Vince 
Folks: I have tentatively set the date for our first round-table discussion for Wednesday, December 20th at 3:00pm-4:30pm.  The room, EB3268, will be available from 3:00 to 5:00pm.   If any of you have an issue with the date, please let me know by day's end. Professor Don Kouri of the Physics Department of the University of Houston will start with an informal 30-45 minute presentation (see appended abstract below) of his work and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have. Professor Kouri, please let me know if you have any requirements for audiovisual or other equipment. This excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the subject of our meeting: [...]   topics to be discussed at a small ``roundtable'' format meeting, are: 1. HDAFs for data analysis, including ``gap-filling'', data extrapolation, denoising, mathematical manipulations of digital data (e.g., taking derivatives, applying functions of differential operators to digital data, etc.) 2. HDAFs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear partial differential equations, particularly for equations for which existing methods encounter stability problems. There are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the HDAFs but I think that even trying to do both of the above in a single meeting would be difficult. Of course, in this first meeting we would focus on general aspects of the HDAFs that make them robust for such applications. If, however, you have other topics in which you are interested, I am willing to focus on them. 
Folks: I am trying to set up a meeting with professor Don Kouri of the University of Houston and I believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion. If you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for yourselves, please let me know. This first meeting with Dr. Kouri will introduce the participants to his area of research (HDAFs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and attendants of a seminar (to come up soon). We are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the seminar happen before Christmas (given that this is the in-between semester season for schools). A couple of other similar meetings will follow up: Dr Kevin Bassler  will be talking about Microscopic Simulation of Economic Markets and Dr. Pinsky about the Effect of Solar phenomena on the Earth's atmosphere. Yannis 
Hi Yannis, I got your email without any problem. Regarding timing of a meeting, I am free from teaching duties now so I am flexible. I will be in Houston all of December. I look forward to hearing more from you. With best wishes, Don Kouri 
Shirley, The cell phone listed is my private phone, not the office cell number.

Martin, Works for me. Vince Shirley, Please, put on my schedule. 
Dave, No problem. I shall do it  this weekend. Also, I left you a message regarding Grant Masson (a VP in my group who left and went to work for El Paso 2 months ago). I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He wants to come back after 2 months. My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite competent. I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other side of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. ""The Return of Grant Masson"" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth opportunities (and that I am good manager). Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just re-instate him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required to hire a VP. Vince David W Delainey 12/14/2000 10:29 AM 
Vince, can you provide for me a detailed list of 2000 accomplishments, strengths/weaknesses and feedback against the criteria for the 2000 PRC. I need that in the next week or so. Thanks Delainey 
Howard, Thanks for the message and the paper. We shall hold an internal  follow-up meeting next Monday to review potential projects on which we could cooperate in the future. Vasant and I will contact you to discuss our recommendations regarding the future research agenda. Vince ""Kunreuther, Howard"" <kunreuth@wharton.upenn.edu> on 12/14/2000 10:07:11 AM 
Dear Vince, Jim, George, David and Vasant: Neil Doherty, Paul Kleindorfer and I very much enjoyed our discussion last Wednesday at Wharton  with you on future joint research  with Enron over the coming year. In particular, we see the whole area of capital management and catastrophic risk as a fruitful area for foint collaboration. I am sharing this message with Louis Thomas and Keith Weigelt who direct the FAP MBA program in the hopes that we can find a team to work with us on these issues next semester. Attached is a revised version of our paper on ""Evaluating Risk Bearing, Mitigation and Risk Transfer Using Exceedance Probability Curves: Project Update"".   We would greatly appreciate you and your colleagues looking at the section on ""Cat Bonds Covering Multiple Risks"" (pp. 15-19) to see whether our example and conclusions make sense to you. We look forward to working with your team at Enron   regarding ways that we can build on these preliminary findings to make cat bonds for weather risks  more attractive. Best wishes for the holiday.

Good morning everyone: Several of us were talking and in order to help us get into the ""Holiday Spirit"" we thought it would be nice if each of us brought an appetizer, dessert, chips, popcorn, etc. or anything you desire, next Monday, the 18th.  We will put everything out in one of the conference rooms and celebrate ALL DAY!  Never mind about the calories - this is a once-a-year thing! This is not mandatory - just if you want to and if you remember! Also, don't forget the ""Holiday Party"" at Damians on Tuesday night 5:30 - 7:30 PM. Have a great day! Shirley 
Dear Friends and Colleagues, I have switched again my employment status between self-employment and employment by joining the TXU Energy Trading on the capacity of their Managing Director of Risk Management Operations.  Will commute home on weekends, but otherwise, will be stationed in Dallas.  The new email address is MJermak1@txu.edu, and the phone number is (214) 875-9603. Regards, Martin Jermakyan www.txu.com - winmail.dat 
FYI Vince 
Dear Vince, Thanks for your phone call this morning. I will ring Mike tonight, i.e. Houston tomorrow morning. ....had a look at the temps and anomalies over CA, looks warm for this time of the year (Dec.), there has been an increase in the night time T_min, and T_max remains at an above average level. I will start setting up my models over CONUS this week. Regards, Christian 
Frank, Does this help?  Please, let me know. Vince 
Grant, No problem. Please, give him my E-mail address or the phone number. Vince ""Grant Masson"" <GrantMasson@houston.rr.com> on 12/13/2000 12:02:21 AM 
Dear Vince: ? I am in a somewhat delicate position. One of the  people in the group here has asked me to introduce him to you.? As an El  Paso vice president, I should not have agreed to do this, and frankly, the guy  should not have asked.? But he is clearly very unhappy at El Paso, so, as a  human being, I felt it was appropriate. Also, because this guy would have  contacted you anyway, with or without my introduction, as a professional  courtesy, I would like you to benefit from my experience with this  fellow. ? The guy's name is Joao Neves (Portugese).? I  think he is reasonably bright and seems to have a quite deep understanding of  general finance and financial mathematics. He is a manager and feels very  frustrated because he had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority.  Instead the group's M.D. brought in two Price-Waterhouse-Coopers consultants as  V.P's to run the structuring and quant sides of the group. In this respect, I  can understand his unhappiness. Unfortunately for him, however, I also think it  is in his nature to whine.? I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people  starting with the IT guys (ok, that's perhaps not much an indictment!) all the  way to dismissing Broadie & Glasserman's or Eduardo Schwartz' works as  shoddy or shallow.? He does not seem to suffer well people he considers  fools.? Caveat Emptor, therefore! Having said all this, I do want to  emphasize that he is a bright guy, is very pleasant with me, and, perhaps given  the appropriate environment and supervision, might be quite productive.?  But don't take my word for it. Talk to him, and see what you think.?  Obviously, I would ask that you keep these comments in confidence. I have given  you an honest assessment -- brutally so. ? 'Nuff said! I have fulfilled my moral obligations  both to Joao and to you. ? Best Regards, Grant. 
Grant, I shall be in the office for a few hours today (looks like food poisoning). I shall try to call you from home. I don't see any major problem. I shall call David Oxley and ask how we could structure  the rehire so that you are not hosed this year. Vince ""Grant Masson"" <GrantMasson@houston.rr.com> on 12/13/2000 11:07:12 PM 
Vince: ? Having now the benefit of some experience with El  Paso, I conclude that Enron would offer more for me in the long term.? If  you have an interest in discussing the matter further, please give me a call. I  would appreciate your comments.? ? Best Regards, Grant. ? (Mobile) 281 381 9983 (Home) 713 664 7260

Chris, I have read the paper.  It reads very well. Two comments. 1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard GBM simulation equation and the way it's typically discretized. 2.

I am also including a message I sent to Julie today. ****************************************************************************** *************** 1.

Get used to it. http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1015 Mobile portals mobilize for scale As investors have cooled to new ventures, survival is now at the top of the agenda for mobile portals. Whether a portal stays alive will depend on its ability to offer accessibility, awareness, and the right services. The rest of the struggle---rapid expansion to ensure long-term survival and, eventually, global dominion---will come down to guts and determination. http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1022 The innovative organization The idea that new businesses prosper best when separated from their corporate parents has now become conventional wisdom. Although new ventures do need space to develop, strict separation can prevent them from obtaining invaluable resources and rob their parents of the vitality they can generate. The solution? A balance of partitioning and integration. http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1017 Programmers abroad: A primer on offshore software development More and more companies are going offshore to develop and maintain their software. The reason is simple: this approach saves time and money. Without discipline in managing offshore relationships, however, a company not only can squander the cost and time savings it had hoped to gain but also may face late deliveries, escalating costs, mismatches between expectations and deliverables, and even outright failure. http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1018 +++++++++++++++++Also on the site this month++++++++++++ The alchemy of LBOs http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1021 Late edition: Another chance for newspapers on the Web http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1024 Unlocking the value in Big Pharma http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1019 Magazines' home companion http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1016 A performance index for B2B marketplaces---a mckinseyquarterly.com exclusive http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?url=photo_essay/y2001/home.asp ************************************************** SHARE THE WEALTH!

Dear GARP 2001 Speaker ? This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th February, 2001. ? Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP 2000. There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year. The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event. ? Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues: ? 1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a laptop. ? 2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably PowerPoint). ? 3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my colleague, Claire as soon as possible. ? If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course. ? I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February. ?

Jim, Sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I was traveling extensively and was overwhelmed with many different projects. I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, I cannot make a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two days in a row). I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students. I hope everything is going well for you. By the way, your former student, Shane Green, has joined us for 12 month and is doing exceptionally well.

Dear Vince, Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU classes.? Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to seeing you once again. Sincerely, Jim Garven _________________________________________ James R.

Vince: I would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of this year to 2001. I could not use us all of my available vacation this year because of the following reasons: 1. As you know, I have been supporting three business units (EES, EPG & Enron India) this year. All these units had difficult and relatively long projects that required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron. 2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. Of the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them didn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in recruiting, training and mentoring. 3. Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January, 2000 for a business trip (10 days) and will need to go there again in January, 2001, I could not take leave from my work for the other two units (EES & EPG) for an extended period of time. So, in summary, this year has been a long and challenging one, and as a result, I could not take vacation for more than a few days. I request you to grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year. Currently I have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these, I expect to have 112 hours unused at the end of this year. Thank you, Krishna.

John, He is currently a student at Carnegie Mellon, one-year computational finance program. I got his resume recruiting in  the campus. I would recommend him as a potential hire (my group or trading). Vince John J Lavorato@ENRON 12/10/2000 11:40 AM 
Vince where did this resume come from and is he still employed by the National Bank in Monteal. 
Dear Vince, Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU classes.? Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to seeing you once again. Sincerely, Jim Garven _________________________________________ James R.

Thank you for inviting me to the meeting with Wharton.  It was very interesting.  Let me know when you want to have the follow-up meeting. 
Hi Mr. Kaminski, Thank you for taking your time to interview me for opportunities at Enron. I enjoyed talking you and learning more about Enron and its dynamic business environment. I appreciate your consideration for a challenging and rewarding position in this industry. Please find the attached copy of my dissertation. If you have any problem in compiling this file, please let me know. I respected your insights and perspective on the issues addressed in my Ph.D. dissertation; including the issues on creative model building, factors affecting natural gas and elctricity demand and supply, and implementation of these models to simulate the future and help traders in the decision making of their day to day business. I appreciated talking with you. Thank you for considering me. I am enthusiastic about opportunities at Enron and look forward to hearing from you.

Shirley, Can you reserve the room for Tue, Dec 19, 3:30? Vince 
Vince- George just ""remembered"" the traders' meetings Monday and Wednesday afternoons at 3:30. He' s going to email you- I think Tuesday would ensure a turnout of traders as well as analysts. We  could easily have 20 people there from Power alone, and there's always Gas .... When you decide the time,  can you ask Shirley to reserve a conference room along the size of 30C1? Clayton 
George, Let's move the meeting to 3:30 on Tuesday, December 19. Vince George Hopley 12/07/2000 05:38 PM 
Vince - I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend a session given by Enron Research.  While afternoons are typically the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience that might be a bit smaller. Thanks again George 
Clayton, We can offer the seminar / discussion session on Monday, December 18, at 3:30. Please, let me know if this would work. Vince 
Christie, Thanks for taking initiative on the trip so quickly. Let's meet with Jeff Shankman to discuss the agenda. I shall try to organize a meeting next week after PRCs are over. I agree with your assessment of the group. I was greatly impressed with the caliber of the students. Vince Christie Patrick@ECT 12/07/2000 06:33 PM 
Hi evryone! Vince, Vasant and I are very excited about the Tiger Project!  We all thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet with such an incredibly interesting, enthusiastic and intelligent group.  Thank you for your time! For those interested in the Houston trip on January 18-19th, please let me know by the 15th of December so that I can get the best deal on air fare (one-month in advance). Also, I'll be forwarding the Enron information packages to Donna Piazze for your receipt next week.  I am including Jeff Shankman in this reply, as Jeff is a Wharton grad, leader of one of our Enron business units, and one of the most enthusiastic Enron/Wharton cheerleaders. Please feel free to individually contact me if there is anything I can do for any of you. Thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in Enron! --Christie.

volatilities calculation 
Review for Tue. 
volatilities calculation Winston, I am sending you the documentation on the new methodology for creating ffvols from implied vols. This methodology requires some minimization procedure to fit the given vol curve with a smoothing function. I am sending you the code I wrote that performs minimization with simulated annealing method from Numerical Recipes. We might need to discuss some details. Please, let me know if you have questions. Tanya. 
Clayton, We can offer the seminar / discussion session on Monday, December 18, at 3:30. Please, let me know if this would work. Vince Clayton Vernon @ ENRON 12/07/2000 01:55 PM 
Vince- George is fully enthusiastic for a seminar by Research on these ideas and resource tools. Any afternoon is fine to him- we can probably push the time up to 3:00 or so so everyone who needs to cheat to get away from work early to go shopping can. Clayton

Dear Vince, Christie and Vasant: Thank you for the presentation to the Enron Tiger Team.  It was most informative and well received by the students. This is an exciting project and the students are enthusuastic and anxious to begin.  Many thanks, also, for hosting the dinner at the Palladium.  It was a wonderful opportunity to get to know more about the project, as well the Enron representatives and the students. Listed below is the contact information with team contacts identified. I will send you the teams project preferences as soon as I recieve them from all the students. It may be a good idea to contact the students before they leave for vacation (15-22 Dec) to see who is interested in a trip to Houston in January for planning purposes.  They will return to campus Jan. 16. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist from this end.

Vince, ? I have  left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. My brother  Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from consulting world to  working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I have heard of great deal  about the success of Enron on line business which fits well in the area of his  expertise. I am wondering if you know of some one in London who he can speak to  regarding career opportunities. ? Since  I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my manadate was  broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function  for both the domestic and international businesses for GMAC. Needless to say,  this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than  usual. ? Talk  to you later. ? Anurag ? 952-  857 - 6133

John, It does not sound silly to me.  I don't get that many opportunities to sit down with those guys in a relaxed atmosphere and chat. I shall read the notes and get back to you. I have just come back from Philadelphia and have to catch up  with a few things. Vince ""John D. Martin"" <J_Martin@baylor.edu> on 12/06/2000 09:39:50 AM 
Vince, i know that you are in Philadelphia today but wanted to ship you my ""first pass notes"" before I leave town in the morning.  Please edit/add to or delete anything you think is appropriate.  My objective in the notes is just to get things down on paper before too much time has passed.  When I place something in  quotes this indicates a direct quote. I'll give you a call next week when I get back to town.  Thanks again for a truly memorable experience.  I plan to frame Jeff's Enron model.  It may sound silly to you guys but we academics really appreciate opportunities like the one I got on Monday.  What a truly spectacular day. Take care, John p.s. Andy gave me his note care describing the demand for a peaking plant but I wasn't able to get him to sign it.  I hope I did not offend him by asking for his signature on that silly graph.  After I left his office it occured to me that he might think I was making light of him.  Please explain to him that I was not and will treasure his simple model as capturing the essence of optionality in a real asset. - EnronInterviewNotes.doc John D. Martin Carr P.

Ken Enron supports employees' involvement in civic organization and I think you should continue tour involvement with LWF. It's important that we give  something back  to society. You don't have to take a day off to attend workshops. Vince Kenneth Parkhill@ENRON 12/04/2000 09:19 AM 
Vince, I am currently a candidate member of Leadership Fort Worth through August of 2001.  I don't know if you are familiar with Leadership Houston or any other Leadership group, but it is basically a civic organization that provides a forum for leaders to learn more about their community and opportunities for civic leadership.  For their first year, members are candidates and must attend about 1 full-day workshop a month in FW, normally on a Thursday. After that, members can transfer to other Leadership cities.  I talked with Stinson about the group and he thought I should talk with you about whether or not I should stay involved with LFW.  The attached email describes the December meeting scheduled for 12/14.  Thanks ken

John, We finished the Version 2 of the simulation model which deals with the open-close trading versus the continuous trading in the previous version. I added the cummulative P/L as an output.   There are a few apparent trading strategies from this model: 1) Higher bid/offer spread, more profit 2) More Daily # of trades, more profit 3) Smaller net open positions allowed, more profit 1) and 2) are obvious, but 3) is more interesting.  It means that we are better off if we do not allowed net open positions at end of the day.  In a trending market, this makes an intuitive sense, for example, in the case of bull market we are short as a market maker and we can avoid the loss at the higher openning price by keeping zero or small net short positions. I have attached the model with this mail, and I'll  be happy to discuss the model in more details with you. Zimin

Sevil:  please let me know when you will be sending me the information for your HIB visa? Thanks Margaret 
Sevil:  In order that we may proceed with your request for Permanent Residency, our immigration attorneys have advised us that we need to process the HIB visa, prior to the Permanent Residency application. Therefore, I am attaching an HIB visa questionnaire that I would like you to complete and return to me, together with copies of all of the documents listed at the bottom of the form. Please bring these to me in 3AC2026A. Please let me know if you have any questions at x55083. Thank you Margaret 
Folks, Those of you who have used UNIX are probably familiar with the grep command. It's used to extract lines from a set of files that contain a given input string, and is very useful. (If you have any questions on how to invoke it, ask me.) The grep command is now available in a PC version -- see below. Joe 
Todd and Joseph, As discussed earlier, I did recall reading somewhere that grep had been ported to Windows. I did some research and was able to find the Windows ported version of grep. Attached you will find a compressed file that contains the grep binary and source. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Thanks. -carlos

Stinson, I think the gamma will flow into V@R. Vince Stinson Gibner 11/30/2000 06:14 PM 
Alex, Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a couple of additional changes. 1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values. 2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities. 3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma. Thanks, Stinson

Van, It's nice to hear from you. I am sure that you can always come back to Enron if you don't like living in New York. I used to work for Salomon and chances are you will be working in the same building in lower Manhattan where I spent 7  years of my life. I hope you have a great Holiday  Season.

Dear Vince: I just wanted to get in touch with you, as my last fall semester here draws to a close and this is something of a transition point for me.  To update you on my job search, I have been extended an offer for a position within Enron's Analyst Program.  The offer was very attractive and I had numerous things to consider in reaching my decision.  Unfortunately, I will be declining Enron's offer of employment to take a position in the Investment Banking Division of Salomon Smith Barney in New York.  My preference at this point is to live outside of Houston, and although my hope is also to return to Houston in future, New York offers some exciting options for me now.  I will be starting there in July of this summer.  I hope that I will have future opportunities to be an advocate of Enron and look forward to keeping in touch with you and the Research Group. Please give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very happy holiday season!  Also please feel free to contact me at any time. I can give you my future contact information when I have it. Thank you and I hope I'll see you again. Sincerely, Van P.S.  Feel free to forward my news onto Mike Roberts if that would appropriate.  I didn't have his email with me. 
Mike, The name of Anjam's replacement is Sharad Agnihotri.

Stinson and Vince, I finished the second version of the model which deals with Open to Close trading. The major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at Open price which will affect the P/L. I also added the output features that John wants to see. The cumulative P/L is path dependent, the Net Open Allowed seemingly has a strong influence on the cumulative P/L trajectory.  (the anomaly I discussed with Vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further examination). Could you review what I have done before we talk to John again ? Zimin

Hi Helyette, Congratulations on your papers. The purchase contract is in the last stage of approvals (it's circulating through different parts of the company where it has to be signed). I think we should be able to execute the contract  in the first few days of December. I shall let you know as soon as our internal process is completed.

Dear Vince, I guess time has been flying for you by since our brilliant show in Paris.In my case,it is the same:I got 3 papers accepted in THE 3 major Journals in Finance(Journal of Business,Journal of Finance and Journal of Financial Economics).We should write a piece! Our software seems to be quite satisfactory for the oil people.My lawyer had added a paragraph to Karla's document:since she had mentioned the right for Enron to check at any time the code source etc,he wanted to request Enron to pay his fees in the case D-G disappeared.In any case,if you are still interested,we are ready to use your escrow account to make things simpler.Moreover,I am striking an agreement with a software company ,13years with people from Polytechnique+finance,to be our hot line(with us paying royalties,of course).This would complement my 2 associates. Looking forward to hearing from you Helyette 
Anita, Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the stay. I would leave the final decision to Iris, in coordination with Vasant and Amitava, based on the business need.

I can have her return on Friday, April 11, 2001 or Tuesday, May 15, 2001.   Her only request is that she return before May 17, 2001 when Professor Kulatilaka from Boston University is here.    When do you want her to return? Thanks.  Anita

Donna, Thanks for the restaurant recommendation. I would appreciate if you could coordinate the dinner with the students and the faculty.

You may want to view their website at www.palladiumrestaurant.com  I think they have a nice menu and can accomodate large groups.  There are several menus from which to choose, as well.  Please let me know if you would like for me to set this up for you and I will notify the students and faculty. Please let me know if I can assist with your visit in any way. Regards, Donna Piazze

Alison, My group needs generally people with advanced skills in mathematics and programming. I shall try to help you by forwarding your resume (with your permission) to other units of Enron. Please, let me know if it's OK with you. Vince Enron North America Corp. 
Vince: I did get the proposal out today, but after close of business your time. Sorry for the brief delay.  You will find two attachments.  The first is our time and materials contract, which will need to be executed if you want to do the test project.  The second is an addendum to that time and materials contract under Section H, which allows for specific work statements to amend and supersede the general consulting agreement.  The general consulting agreement (termsandconditions.doc) contains all the confidentiality, billing rate, and other provisions that your contract people will probably want and provides a general framework for doing business.  The work statement (testproject.doc) contains the specific provisions for our standard weeklong onsite test project. I hope we get the opportunity to serve you and ultimately to make MarketPoint available to you.  In light of the contiguity to the holidays, I dont think it would be realistic to try to schedule this test project before then, probably from your perpsective as well as ours.  Let's think about doing it the first opportunity in January if you decide to go forward if that is OK with you. All the best. Dale - testproject.doc - termsandconditions.doc

Laine, I can initial it. Please, contact Beth Perlman as an IT officer. I shall explain the reason we are buying the software to her. I want the software to reside in our London office - the software is used primarily by European utilities and we shall use it as a pricing tool in negotiations with European clients. Vince

Tom, We are currently space constrained but we shall always take a qualified candidate. Please, ask George to send me a resume and we shall get in touch with him to arrange a phone/on-location interview. Vince Tom Arnold <tmarnol@lsu.edu> on 04/25/2001 09:15:09 AM 
Hey Vince, Given that the Eastern Finance Conference is already taking place, I think it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round table discussion.  However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially having been on such a round table discussion. I've been teaching a ""real options"" course that has the students performing monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course. However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations. This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you recommend that he do to get his foot in the door? His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant. Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too much. Tom Professor Tom Arnold E.J.

Hi again, I am visiting several family members and friends over the next few days. Therefore it will be hard to contact me. However, next week I will be easier to reach.

Hi again, Thank you for your email.  Sorry for the phone tag and email tag.  I will try to call you again next week. In the mean time, I thought I would send you a couple of documents to give you an idea of some of the work that I have done that may be of interest to Enron. 1.

Because these documents are very large I will forward them in two separate emails.  Your comments on them would be appreciated. Happy Thanksgiving, Iris 
This is the first draft.  Please let me know if you want me make changes. 
Dale, Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you= =20 mentioned=20 another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  compa= ny=20 employees on a case-study. The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the= =20 purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us= =20 to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model=20 internally. Please, let me know more about this option. We are primarily interested in a long-term natural gas model and the databa= se=20 for North America. =20 Unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite, we don't= =20 have resources to spend too much time on it. Of course, a trading desk may be interested in the short term version of the model. I shall talk to them about it. Vince ""Dale M. Nesbitt"" <dale.nesbitt@worldnet.att.net> on 11/13/2000 06:00:05 PM 
John/Vince: I really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people.  Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people. As I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for MarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire bundled product, which includes ? North American gas, short and long term ? North American electricity, short and long term ? World gas ? Western European gas ? World oil We are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western Europea= n gas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into MarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are presently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business. As I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and wil= l want to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at the meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately=20 the fully bundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the software licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the electric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for=20 the software license plus the data license for a total of $55,000 annually.  This is just under=20 the fully bundled price.  I think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from MarketPoint=01,s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to =01&scale up=018 to = another model or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the ga= s decision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward.) I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of ou= r approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the sam= e time its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I look forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business. If you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount MarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest yo= u begin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1=20 day training seminar. Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1=20 day training seminar. Thereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a few weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks later. Thanks again, and all the best.  If there is some item from the meeting tha= t I might have forgotten to send, please remind me.  My notes don't show anything, but I was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted.

Steve, I talked to Mike about taking you out to dinner sometimes next week. Let's close the loop on this on Friday. Vince Steve Bigalow@ENRON 04/25/2001 08:23 AM 
Good morning Vince, NEM needs to close above 17.20 to show upside potential. A stronger mining play looks like AU. I want to thank you for going to bat for me as much as I hear that you did. Enron was a company where my skills could be very beneficially used. I regret that we didn't get to scratch the surface of what I could contribute. I feel that beyond being business associates, you and I became good friends. I hope that can remain constant through out the future. The one true question that I would like to pose to you is this. It appears that the political arena here at Enron is currently unfavorable for technical analysis. Without fear of hurting my feeling one way or the other, should I consider having future opportunities with Enron once, if and when, the management situation becomes different? If nothing ever meshs, that does do stop you from contacting me whenever you need Candlestick/technical evaluations. Your good friend, Steve

Dear Mr. Kaminski, I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will be running our ""New Era"" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to bring our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have 30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are working with Duke, and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Norma FYI Vince 
Norma, I talked to G. Koepke, an associate reporting to Maureen She told me that things have  significantly  improved in recent weeks. 
FYI Vince 
David: On #1, I would say the problem is not with the calculation part, but with the market information, or lack thereof (i.e., illiquidity). The gas desk is responsible for the supplying prices and volatilities. It is upto them to decide how they want to account for illiquidy: change the bid/offer spreads accordingly, or add hedging costs, or something else. And on the correlations, they do matter but not as much as volatility or price. Since these are correlations for the same underlying at the same location across time, I think we can make some reasonable assumptions and compute them. Regarding #2, I don't agree with the concept of a market top. What the desk does with the options is to hedge them. And the way to hedge them is hedge teh delta and exercise the options optimally at the same time. Finally, I don't think we can use a 2-year swap as a proxy for a 10-year swap. Longer term prices and volatilies are driven by the cost of production and economic variables and their uncertainities. Those don't necessarily reflect the shorter term issues. Have a great Thanksgiving, Krishna. David Draper@EES 11/21/2000 02:00 PM 
Krishna/Paulo, Can you gentlemen do me a favor and read the attached memo written by Eugene and give me your opinion ? Thanks. Hope you have a great Thanksgiving weekend.

Larry, Thanks. Can you forward the resume to Mike and/or other finance professionals in Enron who could use James? Vince Larry Lawyer@ENRON 11/21/2000 03:10 PM 
Vince, Thanks for forwarding the resume.  We have generally had great success with ex-Koch people. He sounds might like he may be a good fit for Michael L. Miller in principal investments.  At this point I have very recently inherited two other stron VPs from EI and therefore will probably focus on a few Manager and Associates for the near term but I would like to keep James' resume for further opportunities. He sounds like someone we should at least meet with and figure out a spot within Wholesale Services. What do you think? Regards, -Larry-

John, The outline of a message to Nesbitt. Dale, Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you mentioned another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  company employees on a case-study. The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model internally. Please, let me know more about this option.

Dear Sir: The Scientific computation group at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, has recently started to be very interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth market. We find that the specifics of the bandwidth market offer challenges from the modelling point of view. However, we have encountered difficulties when looking for data, and we were wondering if you could help us. Specifically we would like to know for a given city pair for the different existing type of lines ( e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48 .... ) 1. What has been the spot lease prices (e.g. $/line-type/mile) for the past 12 months? 2. What is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line? 3. What is the maintenance cost $/month ? (for the same lines, e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48, ...) 4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines? (e.g. how much does it cost to upgrade) OC3  --> OC12 OC3  --> OC48 OC12 --> OC48 5. How long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain capacity to another (e.g. 1 month, 2 month, ...) ? We realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential data, in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude was provided. I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear?Vincent Kaminski: ? I got your contact details from the  web site for power marketers. I have a strong interest in pursuing a career in  the energy industry?with a top energy company like?Enron, where my  abilities and qualifications can be fully applied for our mutual benefit. I am graduating in May with an  MBA?degree with concentrations in finance and information systems. This  summer I worked?as an intern with Structuring and Analytics group of Ameren  Energy.?This internship?has been especially challenging and has enhanced my professional competencies. While there, I was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view  model?for?off- peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the  data sets of a fundamental?model to create forward price curves. Both  projects added value to the company and provided me with first-hand experience  in the area of energy trading and marketing as well as modeling  techniques. In addition, I have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical  Engineering and two years' experience in power generating. With my work  experience in energy finance and exceptional academic and professional  achievements, along with my exemplary leadership and management potential and  outstanding analytical, business communication, problem-solving and computer  skills, I'm convinced that I will be able to make immediate contributions to  your company. I am attaching my resume for your review. Should you have  any questions or need clarification, please feel free to contact me at (504)  861-9110 or qchen1@tulane.edu.

I made a mistake and put comments for another person into Krishnar's PRC. Please make sure that you ignore it if I can't get it fixed.  Below is what I intended to put in.  My apologies. I will get my assistant to get it deleted and put this information in on monday.  It won't let me do it now.  I guess it does not pay to leave 30 or 40 reviews to the last day.  Paula: Please fix this for me and let Vince know either that it is fixed or cannot be fixed. Innovation/Entrapraneurship No Basis Communicating Goal Setting No Basis Team Work / Communication Excellent.  Very easy to work with and get along with. Business Instincts Excellent.  Krishnar is consistent in asking to help out and asking what more he could do to help us out. Analystical Technical Excellent.  Krishnar has a very strong grasp of what we are doing and how it should be done. Overall Excellent.  My interactions with Krishnar have been limited but positive. Krishnar is always positive with a positive attitude to get the job done. Strengths: Very strong analytical skills with a desire to add value. Areas for Improvements I don't understand Krisnar's role (is leading all research people on our floor or just some) well and have had limited interaction with him.  {all has been positive when it has ocurred} This suggests that Krishnar might spend more time define what his people are doing and getting feedback about their performance, and developing the project scope better.

These are coming out of the walls and some are very funny! NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE To the citizens of the United States of America: In the light of your failure to elect a president of the U.S.A. and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories (except Utah, which she does not fancy). Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85 percent of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: 1.You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up ""aluminum."" Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary."" Using the same 27 words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up

In that occasion I had an informal offer from Vince Kaminski, and the assurance that I would receive a written one in the following two weeks, but since then I have not received any letter from Enron. I would like to know if the offer is still valid, and if it has been sent. I am asking because I am in the process of evaluating my offers, and would like to wait for Enron before I make my final decision. Thanks in advance, Giuseppe Paleologo -- Giuseppe A. Paleologo email: gappy@stanford.edu office phone: (650) 725-0541

Stinson, I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is large and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by those trade earning the half of BO spread. I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we are ready to deliever the model V.1. The next step is to incorporate the intra-day market movement by using high and low prices into the pricing.  I will call you on Monday. Happy Thanksgivings ! Zimin

Everything the Gore campaign was hoping to hear from Judge Lewis this morning they heard from the Florida Supreme Court this afternoon. Voting 7-0 on its own motion, this very activist court of all Democrats ordered Secretary of State Harris not to certify the vote ""until further order of the court."" This is a massive victory for Gore (and more than even the Gore forces expected) and completely reverses the devastating body blow dealt by Lewis this morning. A hearing is scheduled for Monday at 2 pm on the issue of the manual recounts. What this means is the counting will go forward on a 24-hour basis in Palm Beach and Broward counties. This also saps the Bush campaign of much of the positive PR momentum they had built up as we head into the weekend. The justices set a hearing time Monday to begin hearing arguments for a final ruling in the matter, but this quick ruling on appeal is extremely favorable to Gore and should allow the counties time to get real votes tallied and leaked out to the public. Republican observers in the counties have been doing their job and objecting so strenuously to every possible problem that they have prevented Palm Beach from finishing even one precinct over the past two days. That has kept any numbers from leaking to the public as of this writing. But now the Democrats have until at least Monday to get some numbers out in public. The slow pace of the recount augurs poorly for a final resolution of the election.  Dade County, Florida's most populous has just announced that they will recount over 1 million ballots--which they say could take up to a month. We note that the NASDAQ is off 12 percent since election.  Prolonged uncertainty is only bad news for the markets, as the world waits for a sense of direction about US leadership on a range of issues from high oil prices to the Mid-East peace process to economic uncertainties in Argentina and in major currency markets.

from my daughter Kris..... ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++ I saw this on one of my webgroups. I thought it was interesting, and thought you might find it so as well..... Ordinarily I don't post stuff like this here, but I've been asked to do so for the benefit of those RenGeeks who get all their news from here. This information comes from my father, who heard it once (and only once) from the media.  Either from Fox News Channel or from CBS radio.  If someone can post an official source to back this up, I'd love to see it. Anyway, that being said, you may find this of interest: - Regarding those 19,000 double-punched ballots that Florida is not counting, and that the Gore campaign is using to try and call for another vote: These ballots are (mostly) not the result of confused individuals.  In reality, double-punching a ballot is standard procedure for election workers to invalidate a ballot that were punched in error.  If you punch out the hole for someone, and then change your mind before putting the card in the box, and you ask an official for another card, the old card (with your mistake) is deliberately double-punched so that it shouldn't accidentally be counted. In other words, Gore's claim that 19,000 of his supporters are having their votes discarded is completely bogus.  Those double-punched cards correspond to mistakes that have already been corrected. Also of interest - this isn't unusual.  In 1996, Palm Beach had approximately 15,000 double-punched ballots.  For the same reason. Because people made mistakes and needed new cards. While I'm sure some of the double-punches were from clueless voters, it is completely wrong when the media says that this is the case for all 19,000 of them (Souce for the 1996 figure: http://foxnews.com/election_night/after/confusing_ballots.sml) - Regarding the ""illegal"" butterfly ballot that the Gore people want invalidated (to call for a re-vote in Palm Beach), they are conveniently ignoring some of that law. The law in Florida is that a ballot, once designed, is presented to both parties for review.  They have 30 days in which to file complaints.  If nobody complains before the election, then it can't be thrown out afterwards.  Neither the Republican nor the Democratic party filed any complaint with the ballot during the 30 day review period. - Regarding the 3400 Buchannan votes that came from Palm Beach.  It's actually not as surprising as the media would have you believe. During the campaign, Buchannan held a fund-raising dinner in Palm Beach.  He was able to get 1000 attendees.  If 1000 people were willing to pay money and attend his fund raiser, I would consider 3400 votes from that same place to be very surprising. -- David

We have said the election is in the hands of the courts; the courts and momentum are now swinging toward the Bush camp. The unequivocal ruling by Leon County circuit Judge Terry Lewis rejecting the plea by Democrats and affirming that Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris did indeed exercise her discretion in rejecting the hand recounts totals represents a stunning setback for Vice President Al Gore. ""It appears that the secretary has exercised her reasoned judgment to determine what relevant factors and criteria should be considered ... my order requires nothing more,"" the terse Lewis verdict read. It means the certification of the Florida vote is likely to proceed on Saturday, with Secretary of State Harris certain to declare Bush the winner and give Florida's 25 electoral votes to Bush and thus put him over the top with 271 electoral votes. This is not formally over as the Democrats are likely to immediately appeal the Lewis decision to the Florida State Supreme Court and other legal challenges are still pending (e.g. the Palm Beach butterfly ballot challenge). But it will be an extremely difficult path from here. For now Palm Beach and Broward are still recounting, waiting for the Supreme Court to tell them to stop much like they waited to be told to start. If they are told to stop, then it is obviously over. The Gore campaign staff will also have to move quickly to send their appeal to the State Supreme Court. But the Court may not even hear the appeal, for proving Harris did not act with discretion -- already difficult as the Lewis ruling showed -- will become even more difficult on appeal. The Democrats now have to race against time as their last remaining asset is to ""leak"" a hand recount total that would have put Gore ahead -- if Harris had accepted them. But as the legal options dwindle, and the court of public opinion becomes even more important, the Lewis ruling and the inevitable Harris certification (barring intercession by Florida's Supreme Court) tomorrow provides the Republicans with a powerful public relations weapon to turn public opinion sharply in favor of calling the race over. Of course we are still waiting for the approximately 2300 overseas absentee ballots to be counted and there is a small possibility that these may help Gore. However, Bush has won over 60% of the overseas absentee ballots received to date.

Jim, I shall be glad to talk to them. Vince James L Bouillion 04/24/2001 01:43 PM 
Vince, would you be agreeable to such a phone call, or would you prefer to designate someone in your group? 
Jim, Thanks for the feed-back. To assist in the further development of the product, are there any specific areas your group would like to see improved ? Based on comments made during our meeting, it sounded like your main concern was whether or not CHARM would have the capacity to cover the very different and complex risk areas that your company is involved in. Would you mind if someone from our CHARM group called you or Mr. Kaminski for some specific comments ? Regards, Bertil James.L.Bouillion@enron.com on 04/24/2001 01:35:09 PM 
Bertil, I again wish to thank you for the presentation on the CHARM product.  The response from the group is that the model requires more work before Enron could consider it as a commercial product.  Please keep me advised as I assume that you will continue to develop the model. James L Bouillion 04/11/2001 06:50 AM 
No word yet.  I will follow up with the attendees. Thanks for taking thje time to make the presentation. ""Bertil Olsson"" <olsson_bc@willis.com> on 04/10/2001 04:07:11 PM

I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4 I am sorry.

The link is as following. http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/ I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email... My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu) wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him during the summer, while I am staying there. His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?) and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace... XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk .. system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system, e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc... many technical aspects of e-business... He wants to do some kind of technical case study that is beneficial for both ENRON and him. He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the summer. (And to be frankly, this will be good for me too, because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..) Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him? Thank you.. Sincerely, Jinbaek - FCP-invite.pdf

Tanya, Naveen, Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes of prices and positions. This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas portfolio. A big jump in the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price movement may produce an observation that looks artificially big. If the volumetric position was frozen, it's just a scaling factor and there should be no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach is to separate the price process from the position changes. Vince Tanya Tamarchenko 11/13/2000 08:38 AM 
Naveen, I am trying to answer the question: what is the appropriate stochastic process to model the behavior of commodities' prices in our VAR model. So what  I do care about is the behavior of log-returns. Any help is appreciated. Tanya. Naveen Andrews@ENRON 11/10/2000 04:35 PM 
Tanya, We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols. Regards Naveen Tanya Tamarchenko@ECT 11/10/2000 04:17 PM 
Naveen, I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts. For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns: [ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t) and compared the results to normal distribution. I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large returns more frequent than normal), which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

Vince, I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent match for you.

Vince, I WILL be able to attend the PSERC seminar on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.  I also picked up some additional information from UT concerning PSERC this past weekend while I was in Austin . 
It's OK to delay the materials for Duffie. He is very busy anyway and is not going to complain. Vince 
Hi Amitava, We've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we'll provide to Darryl Duffie.  We think it would be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the ""product"" we'll send to Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts. I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to London as required. Please let me know your thoughts. Cheers, Scott

Naveen, I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts. For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns: [ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t) and compared the results to normal distribution. I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large returns more frequent than normal), which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

Vince, What case studies do you have on Enron? Vince J Kaminski 10/11/2000 16:15 
Eric, I have a number of case studies on Enron but not the one on Sutton Bridge. I know that Peter Tufano was working on it  but when  I checked the HBS site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it. When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was ready and he  was going through Enron's internal approvals. I cc Mark Palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study. I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments. Vince Eric Gadd 11/10/2000 05:49 AM 
Vince- Where might I find copies of the case studies Enron has published?  I'm particularly interested in the Sutton Bridge publication for Havard but would like to know if there is a library of case studies. 
Tanya, We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols.

Vince, As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, he is writing a study about the hedging strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would like to get forward oil prices form us. The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities in Germany, it would be great if we could help him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle angibt: "" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above, for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources made available some proprietary historical forward price curves from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine

Bryan, We shall be glad to  take a look at the system. To sign - off on the vendor provided system we have to look under the hood and review the algorithms. I hope the vendor will have no objections to it. Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the system you want to buy with the rest of VaR/credit systems. We shall stand by to help in this endeavor. An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be rolled into the existing risk systems. Vince Bryan Seyfried 11/10/2000 03:20 AM 
Vince/Steve -- we are going to the Board in December to ask for formal limits.  As you know one of the key limits at the Board level is Value at Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our approach for calculating VaR.  We have implemented a third party risk system which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt positions in.  The system has a VaR engine which is being demo'd by the vendor today.  Ben and Kirstee are attending the demo and if they find the technology acceptable, I propose moving forward with implemantion of the module.  Pls. let me know if this sounds reasonable and how you would envision implementing. thanks

Rick and Ted, It looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding chicken houses. I shall send a message to Bryan saying that the Research has to look under the hood and examine the mechanics of the model in order to sign off on it. A dog and pony show is not sufficient. In any case, the decision to approve the model should not be left to Ben and Kirstee. Please, let me know what your thinking is. Vince

Gentlemen, I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3 power trading desks. I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000). Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it very useful for modeling transmission problems. Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this recommendation. Vince 
Vince, We have three options to increase our availability across Enron for the Power World load flow software. Option 1, Upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only. Price $9,990.00 This would give all of Enron the ability to perform load flows, but not determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity (ATC) because only the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) version can perform that task. Option 2, Site license for the load flow and purchase 1 OPF package for Walter Coffer's group.  Price $11,240. This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows and one other group the ability to determine marginal cost and ATC. Option 3, Site license for load flows, OPF and ATC.  Price $14,990.00 This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows, marginal cost, and ATC. Regards, Lance

Attached is a summary of recent FERC activities (PDF file) and the weekly Alliance Express. The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting, followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings. In a brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section 203 merger filing requirements, generally as proposed, and extended the existing NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be determined to be ""workably competitive.""  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation.  Additional details are provided below. FERC Updates, Streamlines Merger Filing Process FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting requirements for mergers.  However, Comm. Hebert did so with reservations, as discussed below.  Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued, but adds more detail and more certainty to the industry.  Staff stated that the Order is improved over the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products. According to FERC, the draft Order: -  revises the Commission's filing requirements to reflect existing merger policy based on FERC's 1996 Merger Policy Guidelines; -  provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market analyses.  The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with potential horizontal competitive concerns.  In addition, the rule establishes informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses. -  streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise competitive concerns; and -  reduces the industry's regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing requirements. The Rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. Commissioner Reaction: Comm. Hebert expressed reservations that, although he was voting for the Rule, FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) market concentration analyses and that FERC should follow the lead of anti-trust enforcement officials, who could also analyze mergers faster and more confidentially. He also stated that FERC should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them, not before, and that there should be a definite time frame for review.  Hebert did mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission assets would be exempt, that ancillary services would be considered as a separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative market analysis. Comm. Breathitt supported the Final Rule, stating that it should expedite the approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the fact that older, irrelevant requirements have been dropped.  She indicated that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting the public interest by stating that the process will be ""efficient yet sufficient"".  The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail competition and one of her main concerns, confidentiality. Comm. Massey fully supported the Final Rule, emphasizing that it would improve response time, lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the industry to better predict Commission actions.  Like Commissioner Breathitt, Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants to point to other factors when concentration appears too high.  Massey also stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERC's concerns, such as future mergers when they occur in succession, retail competition, mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and analysis of ancillary services.  In sum, he averred that the Order will provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis, while taking into consideration the rapid changes in the industry. Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was a very important Rule.  In response to Comm. Hebert, Chairman Hoecker said that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERC's report before issuing their own, that the anti-trust enforcement agencies rely on FERC's expertise when reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries.  There is a major positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work, he noted.  Because the RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market, he indicated, RTOs will help to preserve competition.  Therefore, more and larger RTOs should allow for more mergers, he said.  The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger, but that it would certainly be viewed favorably. NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably Competitive In a 3-1 decision, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, FERC extended the existing NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be ""workably competitive.""  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation. In so doing, FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISO's September 1 and 8, 2000 compliance filing, submitted pursuant to its May 31, 2000 order imposing a temporary bid cap through October 31.  The ISO's efforts to correct market flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had not yet satisfied the Commission's directives, FERC concluded.  FERC found that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas, overall the ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISO's non-spinning reserve market by April 2001, as the ISO requested. Commissioner Reaction: Comms. Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an ""imperfect solution,"" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the ISO's market.  Comm. Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls.

I would like to invite you to present a section on  Risk's course entitled, ""Practical application of advanced stress  testing"" which will be held in London (5 & 6 February 2001)  and New York (12 & 13 February 2001). ? You have been recommended to me in the course of my  research as an authority in this field so I would be delighted for you to  present any of the sections that are still available on the attached  programme: For London: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4 and For New York: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4 and 8 My market research indicates that advanced stress  testing is a highly interesting theme for a wide range of senior quantitative  analysts and risk managers. I anticipate the course to be technical and  practical in nature and assume a high level of knowledge from the delegates. It  aims to extend the scope of accepted practices into the new areas of liquidity  and credit risk stress testing and complement VaR methods by introducing new  risk measurement techniques that can be applied in an integrated  context. ? Please contact me as soon as possible with an indication of which section  is most suitable for your current interests.

W32/Apology-B. 2. VBS/LoveLet-AS. 3. VBS/Kakworm. 4. W32/Qaz. 5. XM97/Jini-B. 6. VBS/LoveLet-G. 7. WM97/Marker-C. 8. W32/Pretty. 9. (tie) W32/Flcss. 9. (tie) WM97/Thus-T. Today's bug patches and security alerts: Microsoft releases patch for ""Indexing Services Cross Site Scripting"" vulnerability We reported this vulnerability in the last edition of the newsletter - it was another Georgi Guninski find. Microsoft Internet Information Server contains a security hole that could allow a malicious user to inject code into a Web page that can be used to access a remote computer. A similar problem was discovered a few months ago in a previous version of the software. For more information: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-084.asp Patch available for ""Netmon Protocol Parsing"" vulnerability The Network Monitoring tool that ships with Windows NT, 2000 and Microsoft System Management Server contains a flaw that could allow a malicious user to gain access to the affected system. The problem resides in Netmon's parsers, which have several unchecked buffers that can be exploited by sending a malformed frame to the server. For more information: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-083.asp Patch available for ""Malformed MIME Header"" vulnerability By passing specially formed MIME headers to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, an external user can crash the server. The system will need to be rebooted before it will work again. For more information: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-082.asp ********** Red Hat releases patch for kpackage The kpackage module that comes with Red Hat Linux 7.0 crashes when files are installed or uninstalled. Patches can be downloaded from: ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/i386/kpackage-1.3.10-7.i386.rpm ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/i386/kpackage-1.3.10-7j1.i386.rpm Updated svgalib package available The svgalib that ships with Red Hat Linux Powertools contains a bug that causes it to crash when the library is compiled into other applications. Updates can be downloaded from: ftp://updates.redhat.com/powertools/7.0/i386/svgalib-1.4.1-12.i386.rpm ftp://updates.redhat.com/powertools/7.0/i386/svgalib-devel-1.4.1-12.i386.rpm ********** HP reports vulnerability in dtterm Hewlett-Packard has released a patch for the dtterm module after it was discovered the module could be exploited to gain root access. The alert does not mention how this could be accomplished. Patches and workarounds can be found at the HP IT Resource page: http://itrc.hp.com ********** Allaire issues patch for JRun DoS vulnerability After a slew of patches last week for JRun, Allaire has returned again this week with another patch. This one protects against possible denial-of-service attacks. By sending malformed URLs, the Java servlet handler leaks memory and could consume all system resources. For more information and a patch: http://www.allaire.com/handlers/index.cfm?ID=18085&Method=Full ********** FreeBSD reports DoS vulnerability in getnameinfo() function FreeBSD has issued a patch for the KAME project that fixes a problem in the getnameinfo() function, a protocol-independent name resolver library. By sending a malformed request to the function, it is possible under certain circumstances to crash the affected server. Patches can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:63/getnameinfo.patch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:63/getnameinfo.patch.asc Top allows reading of kernel memory The top module, which displays system resource usage, contains a format string vulnerability that could allow unprivileged users to execute arbitrary code on the affected FreeBSD machine. For patches: ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:62/top.patch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:62/top.patch.asc ********** USSR reports flaw in Ultraseek search engine USSR Labs is reporting a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Ultraseek search engine. By sending malformed URLs to port 8765 (Ultraseek's default port) it is possible to crash the search engine. For more information and links to patches: http://www.ussrback.com/labs56.html ********** Today's virus alerts: XM97/Divi-Y - A variant of the XM97/Divi-A Excel macro virus. No other information was given in the alert. (Sophos) XM97/Divi-W - Another variant of XM97/Divi-A. Puts the file ODR.XLS in the XLSTART subdirectory. (Sophos) XM97/Barisada-G - This Excel macro virus variant activates on April 24, 2001 between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. It leads the user through a series of dialog boxes before attempting to delete the content of the infected spreadsheet. (Sophos) WM97/Class-FB - This Word macro virus is a morph of two previous viruses, WM97/Class-B and WM97/Panther. No other information was provided in the alert. (Sophos) Win32/Sonic.B.Worm - A variant of the first Sonic virus, this one spreads via e-mail and comes with the subject line of ""I'm your poison"" and an attachment called ""lovers.exe."" (Computer Associates, Sophos) WM97/Bablas-AS - This Word macro virus infects the Tool/Macro and Tools/Template menus. When they're accessed, a message will appear. (Sophos) WM97/Marker-FQ - Virus attempts to change the author information in Word to ""Ethan Frome."" (Sophos) ********** Fusion Face-off: Does Carnivore go to far? James Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology and John Collingwood, of the FBI, debate the merits of Carnivore. Read what they have to say and weigh in with your own opinion. http://www.nwfusion.com/cgi-bin/WebX.cgi?230@@.ee6f90e AOL 6.0 wreaks havoc with some PCs AOL 5.0 was an unmitigated disaster for the online giant. Soon after its release, users began complaining about network settings getting blown away, key Windows files being rewritten, and in some cases, PCs becoming utterly inoperable.

Christie, I am forwarding you a message I have received from the University of Houston. Can you help them? We have a very good relationship with the UoH. Vince 
Dear Mr. Kaminski, I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will be running our ""New Era"" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to bring our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have 30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are working with Duke, and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you! Best Regards, Aisha Jamal Energy Institute 713-743-4634 
Tani, Look forward to meeting you in Houston. What about Wednesday, 10 a.m. or 8 a.m.? Vince Tani Nath 11/07/2000 08:01 AM 
Vince, I'm  planning to be over for the management conference next week, arriving in Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  I would appreciate having an hour with you either then or on Wednesday.  Could you let me know if you are available please? Thanks, Tani 
Poetry Analysis/ Discussion Tulips The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in. I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons. They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are. My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks. I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure. I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free - The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet. The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck. Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself The vivid tulips eat my oxygen. Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself. The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea, 
Shirley, Please, send this memo to the entire group and ask if this demo was given to anybody in our group. Vince 
Vince, I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past. Thanks, Kevin

Dennis Ray Executive Director 608-265-3808 ? ? PSerc Internet Seminar November 7, 2000 ? Time 1.10-2.00 PM Central Time (connection can be checked at 1.00) ? Efficient Available Transfer Capability Analysis using Linear Methods Jamie Weber PowerWorld Corporation 2004 S. Wright St, Suite 102, Urbana, IL? 61801 weber@powerworld.com ? Abstract ? While the concept of ATC has been around for decades, the desire to calculate its value on a large scale is new.? Organizations responsible for the reliable operation of the transmission system are given the task of determining ATC values on a daily basis.? ATC calculations typically includ= e a large number of contingencies as well as multiple transfer directions and multiple system conditions.? This presents a labor-intensive task for those required to calculate ATC values. ? Because of these circumstances, Powerworld Corporation was approached by th= e Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to develop a new software product for their use in calculating ATC values.? The new ATC tool, integrated into the Simulator OPF/ATC software product, was the culmination of this work.? This talk will cover the basic engineering requirements and mathematics that governed the development of the ATC tool.? The concept of Linear ATC analysis will be introduced, along with the underlying mathematics of Linea= r ATC analysis including ? *? Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs) *? Line Outage and Closure Distribution Factors (LODFs/LCDFs) *? Outage Transfer Distribution Factors (OTDFs) ? Attention will be paid to demonstrating the accuracy of Linear ATC on large systems as well as demonstrating what Linear ATC does not model.? Examples will be shown on both small and large-scale systems using Simulator OPF/ATC= . ? Other special topics integrated into PowerWorld Simulator OPF/ATC will also be discussed such as (1) the inclusion of phase-shifting transformers directly in linear analysis, and (2) the iteration of linear ATC for use in modeling controller changes. ? ? Instructions for Audio Connection ? Dail in #:??? (505) 242-2420? you will then be prompted to enter the participant code.? At that time punch in the number below. ? Participant code:?? 193953 ? ? IP Address for Netmeeting ? Read the instructions to down load and install Netmeeting.? At about 12.50 PM Central Time on November 7, 2000, dial the following IP address in Netmeeting?? 128.174.115.8.? Please make sure the resolution on your machin= e is set to 1024 x 768 .? This will be the setting on the machine at which th= e Power Point slides originate.? If your machine is not set to the same resolution, the slides on your machine during the seminar will lose information. ? Jamie Weber was born in Platteville, Wisconsin, on June 13, 1973.? He received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin - Platteville in May 1995 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois in January 1997 and October 1999.? He has worked part-time as a software developer at PowerWorl= d ? Corporation since the company's inception in 1996, and has been employed full-time at PowerWorld Corporation since February 1999.? His primary dutie= s include software development, consulting activities, and software training. His research interests include power systems, economics, and computer visualization. - Invitation.doc

Stinson, Please, take a look at it. Vince 
Pavel, Many thanks for your note. I understand that Digitals are not core Enron business but as you know, I'm trying to explore Digitals to give, for example, a company a guaranteed income in year one (to mop up expiring tax losses). This  is offset by a guaranteed expense in year two. See attached hypothetical example. The digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to and would be part of a price risk management strategy, thereby giving it 'commercial purpose'. I would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject --  the rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets (electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector). It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a 'value judgement' or am I wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it becomes non arm's length and does not pass the smell test? Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also be appreciated. Gillian. 
Vince, A couple of things.  First, I'm planning on your arrival at Baylor sometime the afternoon of Monday, November 13.  I want to set up a small seminar for our faculty if you want to do it.  I will schedule it for 4 pm so if you can arrive in Waco (Continental has several flights in each day) sometime in early afternoon I'll pick you up.  The Ex MBA class begins at 6 p.m. and I'll set you up to speak first for about an hour with q&a to follow.  How about putting together some thoughts related to our paper?  You can do the same talk for the faculty in the early afternoon.  You and I can get then together on Tuesday morning to work on the paper.  I have a 1 p.m. class on Tuesday is my only constraint.  If you have time to hang around we'll do the talk a third time in that class.  By then I suspect we will have made some real progress. Next point, we have both Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling set up for Dec 4th in the afternoon.  I plan to get some questions together for them based on our discussions next Monday and Tuesday. I'm really looking forward to seeing you next week and to working on our paper. Have a great week.  I'm off to Austin and New Orleans this week, thus the reason for the early message on the class a week from tomorrow. Take care. John p.s. Take a look at my web site for a review of the spring ""new economy and business education conference"".  By the by, I need a short bio-sketch on you for the site and for my introduction to the faculty and the class. John D. Martin Carr P.

Vince: I would like to personally thank you for spending the day with us at the MSCF program at Carnegie Mellon.  The time you spent talking to us about Enron, and the energy industry in general, was very much appreciated.  In fact, I believe some students who were not previously interested in energy are now interested because of the things about which you spoke.  I have signed up for an interview for the Associate program at Enron, and I hope to speak to you again through involvement in the Associate program.  Thanks again.
