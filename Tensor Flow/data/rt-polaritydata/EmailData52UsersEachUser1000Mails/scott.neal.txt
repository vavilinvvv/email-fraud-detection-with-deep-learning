please get together so that we will have the appropriate forward quantities re: CES retail  in the book. 
FYI any ideas about possible deals? 
I talked with Hunter.  Kevin Rosetti is the man.  Chris, please bring up to speed on how to handle CES. Chris Germany 03/02/2000 03:08 PM 
I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues. CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue. Comments?

I was talking to Frank Vickers and he mentioned that you might want to talk about an opportunity on the trading side of the East group.  I just wanted to drop a note to let you know that I will be out of the office from Monday, Feb. 12 through Wednesday, Feb. 14.  However, I am eager to discuss any opportunities in trading.  Leave me a voice mail or just catch me at anytime on Thursday. 
Kelley, I am writing to you to follow up on our discussion last week regarding disclosure of counterparty names for price verification purposes. Can you give me the name and contact information for the person within your company that would work with us to put a Confidentiality Agreement in place. Jeff Hodge is our lawyer who will work on this for Enron.  Jeff can contacted at 713 853-6911 or by email at jeffrey.t.hodge@enron.com. Thanks for you assistance. 
I believe Vince Kaminski could possibly be of assistance in this matter. Damon Kovelsky <dkovelsky@meridien-research.com> on 03/12/2001 02:05:06 PM 
Mr. Neal, I wrote you last week a request to spend some time talking to you about Enron's Energy Risk Management for a report I am writing on energy risk management applications.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I would just like a half hour to talk.  If you would like a list of questions, I would be happy to provide them. This conversation does not have to be on the record if you don't want it to.  The main purpose for my enquiry is to understand how energy risk applications are being used ""on the ground"".  I would like to be able to write about Enron, but it is not required. I look forward to hearing from you.

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70. By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

Susan, I don't know if such a letter exists.  Tom, do you know - also, who might be able to help Susan with the information requested below? Susan Elledge @ ENRON 02/06/2001 01:33 PM 
Hello Scott, I recently received a request from Entex to provide a list of active contracts between ENA and Reliant Entex.  I have come across a file containing more than one contract for them, specifically the Natural Gas Services Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001983, dated 9/1/93), and the Natural Gas Sales Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001980, dated 9/1/93).  By letters from you dated 2/21/97, both of these contracts' terms were extended to 3/31/00. Additionally, there is a letter dated 1/13/00 extending the term of the Services Agreement to10/31/02.  I would like to know if there was a 1/13/00 letter extending the term of the Sales Agreement.  If there was, I need to get a copy for the file, and make the amendment in Global Contracts. Thanks for your help.  If you have any questions, please give me a call. Susan Elledge 5-9989

Unnatural  History [IMAGE] If you think  the market can't get much worse, history says you're  wrong. [IMAGE] OpenFund  Commentary [IMAGE] Indices analyzed in this post: Dow  Jones Industrials NASDAQ  Composite NASDAQ  100 NASDAQ  Volatility GSTI  Multimedia Networking GSTI  Semiconductor GSTI  Software AMEX  Biotechnology Russell  2000 Wilshire  TMV Light  Crude Oil Gold 30yr  Treasury Bonds Fed  Funds Futures [IMAGE] Live audio of this commentary: [IMAGE] Live video from our morning call: [IMAGE] After the last two horrible quarters, many of  us are probably telling ourselves that it can't get much worse than it's been.  For those of us who believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this. For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has had  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's fairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent commentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight. Over the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has been, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse. There were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. There were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single six-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an astonishing 52.92%. Of the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before 1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929. The worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the one ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the 1970s. The most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the one ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the 1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month period. This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no means as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time it  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 has  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 years. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. It can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went down further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an additional 18.24%. Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things getting  better. But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses. If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every day). - TOP.GIF - BOTTOM.GIF - audio.gif - vid.gif

But at the same time it  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 has  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 years. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. It can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went down further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an additional 18.24%. Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things getting  better. But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses. If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every day). - TOP.GIF - BOTTOM.GIF - audio.gif - vid.gif

Mr. Neal, I wrote you last week a request to spend some time talking to you about Enron's Energy Risk Management for a report I am writing on energy risk management applications.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I would just like a half hour to talk.  If you would like a list of questions, I would be happy to provide them. This conversation does not have to be on the record if you don't want it to.  The main purpose for my enquiry is to understand how energy risk applications are being used ""on the ground"".  I would like to be able to write about Enron, but it is not required. I look forward to hearing from you.

Andrea, The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your reference. thanks, Scott - new leo's resume.doc 
Also, send me a copy of your resume.  thanks. ""Kevin B Murray"" <kmurra1@lsu.edu> on 03/04/2001 12:20:04 PM 
Scott: Greetings from LSU.  I sent you an email a few weeks ago, but perhaps you didn't receive it.  No big deal. I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing.  My last semester is shaping up to be pretty tough.  The MBA class in Real Options is, to say the least, tough!  I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, and so far we've learned about Binomial trees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model, risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processes, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, and pricing American, European, and exotic options.  What's also great about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example of how this stuff works in the real world.  It's a great class! One of my other classes, Economic Forecasting, is challenging as well, because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time. Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I need to be doing. I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlighting lines on every page!  I figured I'd start with the less technical books first, considering my workload. I'm going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend, 3/9 - 3/11 with my roommate, Ed Brady, who will also be at Enron in July.  Let me know how your schedule looks, and maybe we can get together. Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new trading rotation that you spoke of is still a high probability.  As I'm learning more about options and futures in class, you're definitely right--I think trading is where I want to be! Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.  I hope all is well in Houston. Kevin 
All is well here.   It sounds like you are very busy.  I glad you are taking the options course - it will really benefit you.  Also,  Andrea Richards is the person I contacted with the Associate program to request that your first rotation be in the Trading group - so we should be in good shape on that front.  Her phone number is 713 853 6499 for your future reference.  Thanks for the email, I look forward to seeing you this summer. Scott ""Kevin B Murray"" <kmurra1@lsu.edu> on 03/04/2001 12:20:04 PM

Rockhounds & Parents, ? Looks like we'll be rained out this afternoon for batting cage  practice.? For tomorrow's practice we'll probably be unable to play on the  field due to standing water, or possibly continued rain, but, we will go ahead  and have a ""skull"" session at my house at 9:00am.? My address is 13611  Pinerock, just off of Yorkchester (between Wilchester and Kirkwood), 4 blocks  north of Memorial. ? The practice tomorrow will be 1 hour, from 9 till 10:00.?  See everyone then. ? Jeff 
Before you begin trading your EnronOnline products on March 1st ... Review the dates on your products. We are in the process of converting ""regular"" products to ""Tokenized Reference Period"" Products. A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system sees as ""Day Ahead"", ""Month Ahead"", ""Month Ahead +1"", etc - but this is not what you or your customers see.   At midnight every night, the system checks the current date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For example, if Product #20451 is ""Month+1"", then on Feb. 28, the Short Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show ""April1-30"". However, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product #20451 to show ""May1-31"".  Note that the Product number stays the same, but the date has automatically updated. When all of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine - your links all stay on the same relative date (links are between Product Numbers, not between Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it might look like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the same Product all the time - only the date changed). Believe it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods will make your life easier in the long run - you will not have to continually create new Products and links. Links between Products which share the same dates should continue in effect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together. The important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have Rolling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates will continue to change automatically on the 1st day of each new month. For example: On Feb. 28, the ""Prompt Month"" product will be March; but on March 1, it will become April, etc. On Feb. 28, the ""Prompt +1 Month"" product will be April; but on March 1, it will become May. etc. To verify if your product has a Tokenized Reference Period or if it has a specific date, please review your product in Product Manager under the 1st tab marked ""Product Details.""   Your product will be ""Tokenized"" if it has the following applications:

Scott, Thanks for the help with Dave Duran.  He wants to offer me a job, and he sent me to talk to Louise Kitchen today, which I did.  She told me that she wanted to check my references.  I was wondering if you would be willing to drop her a note on me.  She would probably put a lot more stock in your view than in most of the other guys I have worked with in EI and EBS.

However, I wanted to bring it to your attention that sitara  #618541 and 618626 are two day deals and my calculations show that $708 may instead be the correct amount of origination.

Scott, I am talking to DTI (CNGT) regarding an Index minus sale for April-01 through  June-01 of up to 4 Bcf. I wanted to send my contact a brief description of how we would go about achieving an Index minus baseload price by imbedding an option.  I am not supposed to know about DTI's potential purchase requirements, so I changed the quantities and months in the example below, since the plan is to take this to her boss. Please let me know if this sounds OK or give me pointers on making it better. Tammi, As promised I wanted to send you a simplified example of how we can guarantee you IF-FOM Index Gas you can take to Michelle. Example:  Note: All prices are notional non-transactable numbers. DTI requires a total of 610,000 DT in April and May as a 10,000 DT/d baseload purchase. ENA Proposal would guarantee DTI IF-FOM Index Minus Gas by embedding an option (Put or Call) into the deal for say 5,000 DT/d. Therefore if DTI has the flexibility to take up to 915,000 DT (in the case of the put) or as little as 305,000 DT (in the case of a call) then ENA can take the value of the option and imbed that into the price of the gas. Let us say; ENA is currently offered at IF - CNG App Index for  April and May @ Index +2 cents, and agrees to sell DTI Index  -2 cents; ENA has lost 4 cents or $0.04 * 610,000 = $24,400. However, if we price in the value of a call option with a strike price of the FOM Index, then that would generate $0.10 * 5,000 * 61 days= $30,500. ENA would use this value to offset the Index loss and make a small margin on the sale.  Therefore DTI is guaranteed Index minus gas, however must have the flexibility to potentially take more or less gas than the baseload quantity. Remember, if the option is out of the money for the entire period, DTI will receive only the baseload quantity.  If ENA exercises the option everyday then DTI will receive the quantities mentioned above still at a price of Index -2 cents. This can work if you need a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed the option in three of the months and buy or sell the remainder in the fourth month at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month period.  Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option will generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guarantee. Please let me know if you have any questions.  If you would like me to do a conference call with Michelle just let me know. Thanks, Sean

Rockhounds & parents, ? Hey everyone, I've finally got the pre-season game  schedule.? I've attached the latest overall schedule (rev 2,?and in a  earlier version of Excell so hopefully it can be easily opened).? Please  let me know if this is a format problem for anyone, I can fax it and/or mail it  if you'll let me know. ? Basically the changes are that our games next week are  Tuesday (6:00 pm gametime?at Memorial Middle School field #3) and  Thursday (8:00 pm gametime at Spring Forest Field #2, our  regular practice field)? Also, I've upped the practice start time  next Saturday to 8:30 am going?till 10:30 (since our game?Tuesday the 6th will?wipe out our practice)?and corrected  the error on the time for the March 10th practice (thanks Trisha).? If  these games are rained out they will not be made up. ? By the way, I've got a practice scheduled for the March 10th  but I'm sure some will be out since that's the first part of SBISD spring  break.? Please let me know how many will be able to attend. ? I don't think this really applies to anyone on our team, by  just fyi:? the league has requested that parents not drop their kids off in  front of the fields (by driving down the dirt trail).? There is too much  kid traffic and they're worried about accidents.? Just keep to the parking  lot. ? See everyone this Tuesday at 7:30. ? thanks, Jeff - RHounds_sched_rev2.xls

If locations need to change, and I'm sure they will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly. sitara #778201 also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother. Thanks, Kam 
Glad to be of assistance.  Don't hesitate to call again. Andrew Fairley 02/20/2001 11:15 AM 
Thank you so much for your time last week. David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several issues helpful for our own market. This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from our side of the pond. Best regards Andy 
(If you're not planning on going camping this weekend, please disregard this memo.) The basketball Gods have issued a technical foul to the Indian Guides by scheduling a late Friday night game for all the boys that had RSVP'd to go camping Friday night, so, here's Plan-B: The official start-up time is now Saturday afternoon.  Let's plan on a caravan to the campsite from Butch Butcher's house.  Let's meet there around 2:00 pm.  If you can't leave at that time (earlier or later), information on the campsites are available at the park entrance under ""Wilchester Indian Guides/Butcher"".  Depending on the outcome of the game Friday night, an earlier caravan may be going Saturday morning.  Stay close to your phones. As mentioned in earlier memo,  we will provide food for Saturday night ( hamburgers and fixin's for the boys).  If  Dads want something other than a burger, please feel free to bring a steak to throw on the grill.  We will also provide food for Sunday breakfast.  Please feel free to bring whatever snacks or drinks you want as well.  Remember to bring bikes, fishing stuff (optional), sporting goods, bug spray, camping stuff (I'm bringing an extra tent), cards, lottery tickets, ...  If you need help getting your bike to the park, call Butch (professional mover). Oh yeah, Directions (if you miss the caravan): From US-59, take Grand Parkway (TX-99)/Crabb River Rd exit and proceed South on Crabb River Rd.  Continue over RR tracks on TX-762 for about 15 miles and take left into Brazos Bend State Park entrance. From Clear Lake area (who's coming from Clear Lake ?) take either FM-517 or FM-528 to TX-35.  Proceed to FM 1462 west.  Take a right on TX-762 and the Park entrance is about 1 mile on the right. Yah-teh-hay! DB

The guy in B.A. that we booked our hunt with is Emilio Paris (phone # 011 541 14 812 2154).  We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about  45 minutes outside of Cordoba.  We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.  Our guide's name was Sergio Abrile.  We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.  We paid $9.00/box for shells.  We aleady had our guns,  however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. shotguns for rent for $25/day.  We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of fall and we slayed the birds.  I think the only time to avoid is during the heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.  The flight from Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour. You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.  I think he is affiliated with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.  I hope this info is helpful. Don't hesitate to call if have nay questions. ""Lee Hanse"" <lhanse@br-inc.com> on 02/12/2001 06:43:00 AM Please respond to <lhanse@br-inc.com> 
I talked to Scott Neal - he lived in BA for a few years and has attended and hosted bird hunts.  He is going to get me the names of some people he hunted with to compare prices, accommodations etc.  A few things he wanted us to check on; 1) BA is a hell of a long way to travel - is the flight bus. class? 2) What time of year are you planning on going - there are better times. Scott was thinking they hunted in May (he is going to check) and had as much shooting (and then some) as he needed. 3) Accommodations in BA and where you hunt.  Again he is going to verify and get some phone numbers but you want to stay close to where you are hunting (not like Mexico) and there are some very nice places - he is thinking he stayed at the Gauge Four Seasons. I will get back to you with more details as I have them. Thanks, Lee - 713-624-9065 (lhanse@br-inc.com) ---------- Original Text ----------

Brother Butcher and I are still in need of a final list of who's in and who's out for next weekend's Indian Guides camp-out at Brazos Bend state park.  Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hr away), most everyone (like me!) will be coming and going to meet other commitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE !!! To refresh your memories,  the itinerary for the weekend is get to the park Friday after school and set up before dark.  (For those who need to go down there later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will be at the entrance to the park.)  Once we get there, the activities are bicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boys playing grab-ass in general.  THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNER SATURDAY NIGHT,  A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT  AND BREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.  For food purposes, we need to know an accurate headcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help getting your bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer (or something).  We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lottery tickets, ... when we get there.  Maps for those who need them will be provided next week. Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags, flashlights,lanterns, etc.  Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks. Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.  We'll make the final call on that by Thursday. To date, below is the headcount: Friday Night   Saturday Night Fallick        ?         ? Stehr          ?         Yes Byrd      ?

Susan, I don't know if such a letter exists.  Tom, do you know - also, who might be able to help Susan with the information requested below? Susan Elledge @ ENRON 02/06/2001 01:33 PM 
Hello Scott, I recently received a request from Entex to provide a list of active contracts between ENA and Reliant Entex.  I have come across a file containing more than one contract for them, specifically the Natural Gas Services Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001983, dated 9/1/93), and the Natural Gas Sales Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001980, dated 9/1/93).  By letters from you dated 2/21/97, both of these contracts' terms were extended to 3/31/00. Additionally, there is a letter dated 1/13/00 extending the term of the Services Agreement to10/31/02.  I would like to know if there was a 1/13/00 letter extending the term of the Sales Agreement.  If there was, I need to get a copy for the file, and make the amendment in Global Contracts. Thanks for your help.  If you have any questions, please give me a call. Susan Elledge 5-9989

As you know, Mog has been selected for the trading track program.  Her initial rotation is scheduled to be in the structuring group with a follow-up rotation in the back room.  However, she would like to do her initial trading-track rotation in the middle-marketing group.  She would be supporting the New York office (in Houston) where she would be assisting Per Sekse and Carolyn Abramo, marketing to and executing on behalf of commodity hedge funds.  I think this rotation would be very valuable in her trading-track rotation.  After her rotation in this group, she would then proceed with subsequent rotations as previously scheduled.  Since those of you noted above had already agreed on the rotation schedule, John Lavorato asked me to secure your agreement for this change.  He is agreeable provided those of you noted are in agreement as well.  The middle-marketing group would greatly welcome Mog and as I mentioned, I feel this rotation would be very valuable to her as a potential trader in the future.  If I do not receive an objection by Thursday, 5:00 P.M. - I will assume we can proceed ahead.  Thanks for your cooperation.

California Power Plants Get Jolt As Natural-Gas Supplies Are  Cut By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is putting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S. burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than gas  and generally has been costlier. In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into  a gas problem. One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas and  electricity affect each other. ""We don't just need new generating plants and  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,"" said Terry Winter, chief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. ""You

Scott, great to see you last week even if it was only for a short period.  I hear that the Org announcement is scheduled for Tuesday November 14th at 3:00.  Have you heard the same ?  I will be back in Houston early next week for the announcement.  I suggest that you and I plan to meet with the group either immediately after the announcement or perhaps after trading the following day.  I tend to think that the next day may be better. In addition, as we discussed I would like to get one of the analysts/associates working on pulling the following information together. List of our states.  maybe there is some overlap with the mid-west but as you know this new organization will have everyone focused and we do not want any confusion. Master list of ALL gas users within those states.  If there are any LDC's etc. that cross state boundaries or cross regional boundaries we will need to know that and make sure Enron coverage is appropriately assigned.  Delainey continues to say that he wants to make sure that everyone is covered and nothing falls through the cracks. From the master list we can determine our current level of business and relationship with that particular market, high, medium, low. From Master list we can determine 2001 assignments. This is fundamental but important in my opinion. Another issue that I was thinking about is that it would be helpful for me to sit in on this years PRC for all members of our staff.  I will not add anything but it will give me a sense of how they are doing and what to expect as we move forward.  Do you approve of that ?  When is that scheduled ? I did not get the metrics from Janet yet but am scheduled to do that when I am in next week.  I will get you a copy at that time. Thanks Frank 
I have prepared  a recommendation letter as  you have requested.  It is my pleasure to do so.  Please advise as to when to send, etc.  I am available to visit on the phone any time after 2:3opm any day this week.  However, I will be out of the office on Thursday and Friday Nov. 16-17.

Hola amigo !!!  I am already missing the Houston beers che. Hey, we are going live on EOL here in south america.... incredible but real ! Rolo launched gas on monday and I will be coming on probably the following week. In order to show potential customers how a liquid product works, could you tell me what product I can show them to actually reflect a moving bid/offer. Thanks, Julian

we need to participate in this interview process.  let me know if and when= =20 you can participate.  sign up at the web site listed below. =20 
The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weeke= nd=20 is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous=20 interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on =01&selling=01= 8=20 candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will= =20 arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have=20 activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Supe= r=20 Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions= =20 while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20 employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes: Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. = =20 We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to hav= e=20 small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a= nd=20 four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant= =20 before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua= te=20 more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20 employees. Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages= =20 (schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20 facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We= =20 have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To=20 facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the=20 interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students wil= l=20 rotate.=20 In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates. =20 Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of= =20 the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that= =20 all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation= =20 forms are completed and input prior to the meeting.=20 Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on= =20 Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday=20 following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 P= M=20 to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron=01,s executive manag= ement=20 team.  Dave Delainey will facilitate the October 28 meeting.  Kevin Hannon,= =20 Jeff Shankman, John Lavorato, Rick Causey and Dan Leff will facilitate=20 subsequent meetings.=20 Need for interviewers.  There has been a tremendous response to the call fo= r=20 dinner participants; however, we are still in need of interviewers for each= =20 of the Super Saturdays.

I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating. I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her and I agree with your comments. Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading. Sincerely, Scott Neal Chip Ryan <cryan@lsu.edu> on 10/19/2000 07:30:58 PM 
Hi Geynille and Scott, I wanted to thank you for lunch today and tell you how much I enjoyed meeting you.  Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to make our classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students.  We appreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuable contribution. One of my former students, Milagros Daetz, dropped by to see met later in the day to tell me about her Enron interviews.  Milagros was very excited about Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met.  I want to offer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf.  Milagros is one of the most impressive students I have ever taught.  While her GPA (3.9) is sufficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to comment on her intangible qualities.  Milagros is mentally tough, hard working, determined, and ambitious.  Just as important, she is a genuinely nice person.  She deals with people very well and possesses what I would describe as quiet leadership characteristics.  In other words,  she leads by example and by reason.  I also find her to be mature beyond her age and willing to assume responsibility for her own choices.  In short, I think Milagros would be an asset to any organization. Again,  it was good meeting you.  Please fell free to contact me if I can help you in any way. Regards, Chip Ryan Assistant Professor of Finance E. J.

fyi we have 2 weeks to check this out without cost.  maybe we can get additional ideas about how we incorporate capacity trading into EOL. 
Guys, A friend recommended Capacity Center, a service that e-mails information on capacity release, daily activity reports and system notices from pipelines on a daily basis.  There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, time frame and the critical nature of  the notices.  The cost is based on the number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months the cost would be approximately $3,000.  If you would like to check it out  I have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 11/5/00).  Click here http://www.capacitycenter.com/  the login name is sboyle@enron.com and password is jackd.  Let me know if you would like an overview or see any reports I can forward them to you via my e-mail.  Or you can call Carol Christopher CapacityCenter.Com Business Solutions Manager 978-535-5868 Thanks, Sean

I would like each of you to list your top 5-10 target customers for 2000 by 
let's talk this afternoon.  I think we need to think about a couple of these folks.  Also, Dave needs our 2000 goals and objectives, top target customers, as well ideas for coverage metrics.  I have a meeting from 3pm to 4pm but am available any other time. Frank W Vickers 10/23/2000 09:56 AM 
Scott, hope all is well.  I will get to the point.  What are your suggestions on the individuals that we have been assigned ?  I need to rely on you for any input that might suggest that we not take someone on.  I understand that Dave wants any personel changes as soon as possible.  What do you think ?  We do not want to begin with HR problems if we can avoid it upfront. Please e-mail or call at 503-464-3940. Frank 
please see a draft of the proposed rules and trading ticket.  please let me know if you have any questions or comments. 
let's discuss what info might be helpful. 
Hey guys, I spoke with Carol and told her we would have an overview for ENA by next Friday. Could each of you e-mail me a brief summary of your business in Florida- just give me a general idea of our level of involvement in your market, general themes we might want to get across, hurdles, etc. Ben/Jim, this may be a very good opportunity to have Kevin lay out our views/plans for deregulation and power development, and what we would like to see the Governor push in the state. Since Enron is in Texas (and the obvious connection with the Bush brothers), if it's appropriate to use Texas deregulation as an example/comparable with Florida, it might be interesting. If I could get your responses by next Wednesday am, they would be great. Thanks. 
Janet and Jim, Kevin Hannon is attending a dinner and a breakfast meeting (November 8th and 9th) with Governor Jeb Bush in Florida.  At this meeting the Governor has requested that the attendees give a three to five minute overview of their company and its interests in Florida.  Kevin asked me to contact you two to see if you if could please give him a brief update via email on ENA's activities in Florida.

From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati= on=20 of mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,= =20 and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than= =20 $0.20 above residual fuel oil. Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and= a=20 slightly lower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem= ber Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60. Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not= =20 expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas= =20 market. Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.= 5=20 Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return = to=20 the gas market should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil= d=20 through October, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much=20 greater, as distillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse= lf=20 in short supply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment= of demand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n= or=20 shutting down production comes easily or cheaply. Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain= s justifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20 significant settling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20 sustained in the mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).= =20 More luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to= =20 the gas market. Gas Storage--The Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20 approximately 8.5 Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag= e=20 5.5 Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of= =20 injections of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in= =20 futures prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of= =20 October. With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20 slowing of injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha= n=20 100 Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October. CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record= =20 low inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb= er. However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20 heating load from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic= h CERA estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,= =20 or even substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20 inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories= =20 will remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b= e=20 priced out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel= =20 oil. Regional Markets-Winter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start = of=20 winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri= ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20 between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t= he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with = the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset= =20 of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe= r=20 (see Table 3). CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows: * Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load, but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November. * San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu for November. * Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should continue through November, with some slight widening in the Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively. * Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per MMBtu. * Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels, but there is little added delivery capacity into that market. CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s. Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20 uncertain. A line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of= =20 200-300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio= n=20 the pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20 quantities of gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses= s=20 precisely the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October = is=20 on par with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in= =20 2000, approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20 shallow trend does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected = to=20 produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl= y=20 build is expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive= =20 growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001. Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have= =20 accelerated; eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e= nd of=20 October. Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect= ed storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20 levels. PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord= er Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte= d=20 to be slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push= ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern= =20 Canadian demand. High Prices, Wide Differentials The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20 October. For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti= ng=20 AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu). **end** Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables. ********************************************************* CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at= =20 http://www.cera.com/event ********************************************************* ********************************************************************** Account Changes To edit your personal account information, including your e-mail address, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

The  CERA  executive roundtable meeting  summary  results are as  follows: If you are interested  in  a complete  set  of  the graphs from the presentations  please  let me know. ELECTRIC POWER  PART  ONE PEAK  TRENDS It is  noteworthy how  rapidly volatility can change geographically in the electric  markets.  Last  year  the U.S. Midwest/South areas   were  the peakiest,  but   it reversed  this year  with  the  West  being highest  at the peaks  and in New England --  but only   in early May 2000 were  hgih peaks  apparent  there. Demand  can vary from half the peak max  to the max.  Peakers  can be on the margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets.  We need to watch  gas prices  this  winter  as they can effect  winter peak power prices--not  just a  summer phenomenon. Where  are  the most gas plants  now on the margin?  Ercot, FRCC, Neepool, NYPP, SERC, WSCC A  DISCONNECT There  is  a disconnect  in the on-peak forward market price for power in Texas now; with the  added  5 GW  Texas forward markets  do not seem to take this  into account yet.  (Note:  Vince Kaminski) The  Texas forward market  should be  very soft  next summer  unless  we return to  105 degree F  temperatures.    New England  is  just one year behind  Texas  in its overbuild. One main  reason for the  spikes  in Calif  is   power plants  did not  get built in Calif   due  to  a lack of  a capacity  charge ..and  this is not a panacea...as Calif also  has  many  enviro/siting  hurdles  that challenge developers  who want to site as well. . TSUNAMI OF  MERCHANT  CAPACITY PLANNED? CERA   sees  over  240,000  MW  of planned  capacity over  the  2000-2005 period;  with   25,000 MW  being  completed  in  2000;  35 MW under construction  for   2001 and 15 000 MW under  construction for   2002--  but the market  only needing   13 000  to  15 000 MW  a year.   This   shall lead  to  many  and large deferrals and  delays, especially in  2001  and 2002.  What  has  been the recent  history?   US  wide  over the past  3 years  just  11 percent of the planned  capacity  was  actually finished  and   18 percent  of that planned  was  actually  under construction.  They  assume  a  24 month  construction completion  time. FOR PROFIT  TRANSMISSION Cera   sees  Allegheny Energy  in PJM West;  Entergy in SPP;  Southern  in SERC  and Alliant  in MAPP  as all for profit transcos. TYPICAL   O&M COSTS  IN U.S.  TRANSCOS Why  do  O&M  costs   differ  widely  among  transcos?  Some  costs  are  3 to 8 times higher  than the norm  at $5000 in O&M expense  per 5000  system  miles  in size.  Regulatory overhang  allows  this...this is  weather  adjusted  to remove  high  costs from  big  freezes  etc. USING REAL OPTION MODEL  VS  POWER PLANT  NPV You  want to  try to have  the base value of  an asset  going  forward  when you expect volatility  and include  historical  spreads  and  fuel/power price  swing  assumptions. CALIFORNIA  MARKET IS BROKEN This market  starts  to  work  only after it   gets into  a reliability crisis.  No incentives  to add power  plant  capacity  and huge hurdles   against  siting   even when the market  signals the  need is there.  Will the  regulator's post 2000  fix  make it  worse? PEAK POWER  DEMAND  FORECAST As  percent  per year  change  vs   2000  Cera  sees   2001  as follows: New Eng  / New York 6.3 /  6.2  percent PJM / ECAR   7.7 / 4.4 percent MAIN /  MAPP    3.0 /   -0.1 SERC /  FRCC   1.3 /  2.3  percent SPP /  ERCOT    4.0  /  2.3 NWPP /  Rockies     -6.8  /  -0.6 AZNM /  Calif-SoNV   -0.9   /   4.0 USA  avg    up  2.6  percent   It  looks  like Calif. in in for a   touch summer  in 2001  as well. NATURAL  GAS  PART   TWO SUPPLY  SHORT Year   2001  supply  rebound could  be  800mmcfd   to 1.0  bcfd;  Canada   in 2001  up only  400  a  day; in the US  we  need   2  bcfd  more supply  for 2001  demand.  alone  let alone  storage   refill.... yet  a cold winter  now  could   add   3  to 4  bcfd  to demand  and slash storages.  The  fall in drilling  in 1999  and early  2000  took   3.5  bcfd productive  capacity out of the  supply pool.  It  will  take  till  2005 for US production to  reach a 4.1 bcfd  gain versus  today's production. ADDED  GAS  FOR POWER PLANTS Right now  Cera  expects  an incremental  need for   1  bcfd  next year for these plants..this will  keep prices  high MUCH MORE POWER SWING 1990 to 1992  we needed   5  bcfd  for power plant  swings;   now  we need 10  bcfd;  offpeak use is  even up  5  bcfd vs  10 years  ago. RESI  USE  IS UP The  AGA  disco members   adds   750 000 new gas   homes  each year  and this  builds  demand  year   round. INDUSTRIAL   NUG  DEMAND Of  the   24  bcfd ( 8.77 Tcf) industrials  gas use  in the US;     8.6 bcfd   (  3.1  Tcf) of this  is for  power plant  and non-mfg  use. HOW  FAST  CAN CANADA  ADD? Canada  can add   3.6  bcfd   by  2005   versus  now;   adding  each year from  2001 to 2005 as follows:  500/800/900/700/700  mcfd annually. IS  ARCTIC  GAS  ON THE HORIZON?

2 primary contributing factors: 1) EOL transaction volume increase 2) CES acquisition Paula Harris 10/09/2000 03:41 PM 
Scott, As you are already aware, we have to provide volume (settled sales only) explanations to Investor Relations each month.  Given that it's a quarter end month, it is even more important that we receive good explanations which sufficiently support your trading business.  The format includes a year to year comparison, quarter to quarter comparison as well as a month to month comparison for any increases/decreases greater than 10%.  Your stats are as follows: EAST GAS TRADING (Bbtu/Day - Settled Sales Only) Year to Year September 2000 7,258 September 1999 3,179 Increase  128% Quarter to Quarter 3Q 2000  7,282 3Q 1999  2,910 Increase  150% If you could send me an explanation explaining what's driving your increase by tomorrow morning, that would be great. Thanks, Paula 
yes, I would love to see all the potential candidates within the entire organization.  Thanks for all your help. 
do you need any info from me? How did our volumes look for Sept.? 
Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday: Pipeline Power Partners 10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200 Houston, Texas 77024 713-290-8762 I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94. Note new email address also. Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call. Conrad - winmail.dat

I definately support  a promotion.  I have not given up on the contract, although I have not figured out how to make it more palatable for her while ensuring she is committed to Enron. Scott Frank W Vickers@ENRON 05/15/2001 02:04 PM 
Scott, Tammi told me that she has chosen not to sign the Employment Contract.  I understand her issues.  Even before she informed me of her decision I was thinking that we should support her for mid-year promotion to Director.  I would like to get your thoughts on this. Frank

Thank you for sending. 
please review.  check to make sure #250196  referenced below is booked properly. 
Cindy, I think we may have a few things missing.     This is what Alagasco shows we have regarding contract numbers and expiration dates: There are four  old CES/ Bring cotracts which have been assigned over to ENA.  They are: Bring reference number   #10170, volume of 20471 expires 12/31/00  (has associated demand fees)     Alagasco ref # --  ENA No. 2,  Sitara #-250042 Bring Reference number  #10055, volume of 10000 expires 11/30/00 (has associated demand fees)      Alagasco ref # -- ENA No. 1,   Sitare #-250050 These are the only  two contract Alagasco wants to terminatein accordance with the expiration date.   In additon we have two other old Bring/CES contracts that have expiration dates in 2001 and 2002 that  they have no intention of  terminating, unless however ENA would allow them to which we would not since they have demand fees with escalators associated with them. They are: Bring reference number #10219, volume of  5339, expires 10/31/01  (has associated demand fees)     Algasco ref # -- ENA No. 3, Sitare #250196 Please note that in the system we have the termination date is correct but the volume is incorrect.  It reflects 10,000 and you can see that the date ranges have been split  each monthby  Joe Casas, whom  changes the volume in the scheduled section to 6,045 to account for fuel and what Alagasco is actually taking.  This needs to be corrected.     .Again, Alagasco has no intention of terminating this contract. Bring reference number #10326,  volume of 10,000 during the winter only, months Nov - March , (has associated demand fees)  Algasco ref # -- ENA No.4 This deals expires October 31, 2002.  Sitara # --250186       This is the contract that allows Alagasco swing rights in which they have yet to exercise. AT one point Scott Neal had mentioned to try to work on taking this swing language out of the contract but I have not mentioned anything to them since they have yet to exercise  those swing rights and I did not want to bring it to there attention.    I do not know how much the demand fees are on this cotnract , but I would assume they are signficant. Alagasco has sent  two termination letters to cancel the first two above contracts, only.  i.e.-- Bring ref #'s  10170 & 10055.    ENA does reflect these properly in the system so I believe we should be able to terminate these contracts.   The other two contracts have nothing to do with the two termination letters Alagasco sent us.   In additon, the two seasonal contracts that were done in Apirl & May 00  between Roger and myself, Sitara deals 242653 & 271301; Algasco  would like to tie these contracts  to the newly signed Enron Portfolio Master Firm Contract   wlhich I also agree with. All deals look accurate in Sitara regarding term and volume except for Sitare # 250196, which I mentioned above.  I do not know the demand fees associated with the contracts so I do not know if they are in the system accurately or if they are being billed accurately. Cindy, I think this information should be everything we need to clear up the confusion regarding Alagasco's pending terminaiton letter.    Please get with me once you have a minute.    Thank you.

fyi  -  interesting storage information. 
fyi  - EOL information 
The quantity adjustment should be 398,487 per the attached spreadsheet. Please confirm. Edward Terry 09/08/2000 09:55 AM 
FYI, Per the memo, ENA's storage account will be REDUCED by 420,588 mmbtu!!!!!! 
The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results. I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values. The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet and the ""official"" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS. To summarize: Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU. Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU. Call me if there are any questions. 
I need the following information: 1)  Daily storage balances May 1, 2000 thru Sept. 26, 2000. 2)  in kind fuel charges on injections  1999, 2000 
Customer has been notified that this deal is subject to a satisfactory LC. Please let me know if you need additional info.

FYI, Per the memo, ENA's storage account will be REDUCED by 420,588 mmbtu!!!!!! 
The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results. I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values. The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet and the ""official"" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS. To summarize: Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU. Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU. Call me if there are any questions.

Argentine Power Market update: A series of sabotage acts occurred last Tuesday, putting the whole Argentine Electric System in danger of collapsing. The problems started at 8:30 PM when one of the 500 kV lines from the Comahue region went down. Around 10:30 PM, 2 other lines went down as well, all in the Comahue-BsAs corridor. All 3 incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high tension towers were sawed. In addition to the transmission lines sabotage, at 10:00 PM, one of the Nuclear plants suffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW. This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finally went out of service as well at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW. As a result of all the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 11:00 PM. Transmission lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday. For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish). Julian 
Sure, no problem.   Sep 25-27 will be the heart of October bid week. DEBRA PERLINGIERE 08/29/2000 09:58 AM 
I am a legal assistant for Jeff Hodge.  At his suggestion,  I am contacting you concerning the possibility of spending time with you or a trader in your area observing ""the business""  during bid week if possible, in order that I may gain experience and information concerning gas trading.

Scott, Yesterday, I received a phone call from Scott Goodell regarding his vacation balance.  He and his assistant thought the was a mistake in his vacation accrual.  I have researched the issue with the payroll department and the SAP team and they see an inconsistency in his account. However, Scott says that he was given 3 weeks vacation (120 hours) as part of the CES acquisition.  His offer letter does not state the 120 hours up front, but we can add this to his balance and correct the problem, if you approve. I know he has contacted several people to resolve this, so I'd like to get back to him as soon as possible. Let me know if this is OK, Thanks, Jennifer 
I will be in attendance.  Please advise as to location.  Thank you. Julie Pechersky 09/08/2000 01:38 PM

US Govt. data - Business inventories rose 0.9% in June, exceeding analysts' expectations of a 0.6% rise and matching the revised May figure. Retailers saw the biggest increase; their inventories rose 1.2% in June. Total business sales were also up 0.9% in June, a slightly weaker showing than the revised 1.1% rise posted in May. The inventory-to-sales ratio--the number of months it would take to empty the nation's warehouses, store shelves, and sales lots at the current rate of sales--remained at 1.32, just off its all-time low. In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in July, double the pace in June. Industrial production, which measures output at U.S. factories, utilities, and mines, is now 5.8% stronger than it was this time last year, due mainly to continued growth in high-tech manufacturing.

Sean, I talked to Bruce a couple of days ago but got a little different spin.  The short list is 6 companies, not 5.  Out of 12 companies, 8 responded and we were second the last.  NIMO was disappointed that more companies did not bid on their RFP.  I asked if an extra $2MM would have pushed us into the short list.  NIMO said yes but it would still not be the highest bid.  Our bid was $4.9 MM.  I think we may have undervalued the CNG transport, storage optionality and the TGP Zone 5 deliveries into NIMO (new interconnect). I have forwarded the peaking proposal to Mark Breese last week and he is working on it.  Let me know if you have any questions. Sean Boyle 08/17/2000 11:21 AM 
I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP.  Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA.  However, he also mentioned we were a close sixth, that is close to the fifth highest bid. He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid.  He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure. NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter, I believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP. Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP. Thanks, Sean 
Here you go.  If you have any other questions, please let me know.

It was good to meet you last Thursday.  It is always fun to harass the NY locals, even if it has to be done through a tele-conference camera. Here is something to file away for future use, save the head-hunter fees and give me a call direct the next time you are looking for a seasoned Nymex futures/options hand.

Network Appliance Selects TIBCO Software to Support Enterprise System Initiatives TIBCO Technology Enables Network Appliance to Integrate Its Internal Enterprise Systems Without Disrupting Its Business PALO ALTO, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Advancing its leadership in the application integration space, TIBCO Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TIBX - news), a leading provider of real-time infrastructure software for e-business, announced today Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTAP - news), the leading provider of network-attached data access and content management solutions, has selected the TIBCO ActiveEnterprisec e-business product suite to integrate its internal enterprise systems and applications. As a fast growing company, Network Appliance has been continually implementing best-in-class enterprise systems such as enterprise resource planning, customer resource management, human resources and manufacturing applications. To integrate these disparate systems and ensure that the right people within Network Appliance have access to the information they need, Network Appliance turned to TIBCO. ``We need an integration tool that will not only enable us to share information internally, but will also enable us to extend access to this information beyond our corporate firewalls, as we expand our e-commerce capabilities,'' said Ric McCormick, director of business applications for Network Appliance. ``TIBCO's proven e-business solutions provide us with the scalability, security and reliability we need to ensure that our technology infrastructure can keep up with our business growth, and just as important, that our vital business processes not be disrupted as we continue to implement new solutions.'' ``To be successful e-businesses, companies need a highly efficient information infrastructure that connects every system and process in the enterprise,'' said Fred Meyer, vice president of product management for TIBCO Software. ``TIBCO ActiveEnterprise is helping leading companies like Network Appliance further leverage their front-end and back-end IT systems and bring those systems closer to customers and partners over the Web.''

Hey Phil, let's set up a meeting for later this week to walk thru this deal structure in detail with Scott Neal. If we think there is real value here to ENA, I'd like to take this to execution asap. However, if we don't think we can/want to make these commitments, let's cut the cord and move on. The critical path item as I see it is what we want to do at Elba Island as far as offtake obligation. There is certainly substantial value here compared to the current gas index price embedded in the Elba tolling agreement. Jeff, depending on your schedule, you may want to try and attend.  Thanks. 
thanks for the info. Yan Wang@ENRON 07/17/2000 01:34 PM 
This one is an exception. I sent out a mail about this site before, about a month ago, let me explain the situation again. It is weird that this web site uses such a long line as the URL link for their critical notices, but Lotus notes can only take the first line starting with http:// as the hot link, this is why you see only the first line was underlined as the link. When you click the partial URL link, of course you'll get an error. To work around this you need to copy the whole five lines, open your IE and paste it to the address box and press ""Enter"". Let me know if there is still a question. Thanks. Yan Wang Bhavna Pandya@ECT 07/17/2000 01:01 PM

riday July 7, 11:43 am Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: Columbia Gas Transmission Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process. In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637, Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance filing made June 15. ``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.'' According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term contracts. Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm capacity. Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with a different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time before a binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid. Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in FERC's Order 637. *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST). *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non- discriminatory basis. *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the Internet. *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available. *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied. *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to all bidders through an Internet-based system. ``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all parties as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said. Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.

FYI 
FRANCE: PDVSA sees Enron LNG deal soon, seeks gas funds. 06/07/2000 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000. NICE, France, June 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) said on Wednesday it expected to sign a contract with U.S. energy company Enron by June 30 to construct an LNG plant in Jose with an annual capacity of two million tonnes. It has signed an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell , ExxonMobil and Mitsubishi to begin construction of a four-million-tonne LNG plant in Paria by end of the year. ""We could sign the contract to start the project (with Enron) by June 30...The plant should be operational by 2004,"" Domingo Marsicobetre, chairman of PDVSA's gas division, told reporters at the world gas congress in Nice. ""The project development agreement was signed with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi last month. In September we will declare the viability of the project and then create a (separate) Venezuelan LNG company (to run it). The milestone is December,"" Marsicobetre said. The Paria plant was expected to be operational by 2005, he said, adding that the consortium hoped to explore further oil and gas in the Orinoco delta platform, south of Trinidad, to add a second and third train to the plant. ""In August a decision will be taken by the shareholders,"" he said. PDVSA would supply associated gas to the Jose plant, in which it would also be a shareholder. The facility aimed to export mainly to the Caribbean and the United States, he said. The Paria plant was designed to export LNG to the north-east United States, Spain and Portugal. Marsicobetre said PDVSA Gas was seeking between $6 billion and $10 billion in private investment to develop the production of non-associated gas, its LNG projects and the Venezuelan gas grid. Expanding non-associated gas and the gas grid would each absorb 30 percent of that total sum while the two LNG facilities would need some $2.6 million. The cost of developing oil and gas production in the delta platform was not included in that calculation, PDVSA Gas executive Nelson Mava told reporters. ""If we move in a fast track we can have twice that investment,"" Mava said. He said Venezuela, the world's seventh largest gas producer with proven reserves of 146 trillion cubic feet (tcf), was counting on the development of non-associated gas to meet rising domestic demand. Venezuelan gas consumption was forecast to more than double by 2009, rising to 4.2 billion cubic feet a day from the current level of 1.8 billion. That meant the percentage of gas in the fuel mix would rise to 55 percent from 42, Mava said. Of the current 142 tcf output, 132 tcf was associated and 14 non-associated. But there were unexplored reserves of non-associated gas of 6-20 tcf onshore and 40-60 offshore, he said. ((Gillian Handyside.

Cove Point LNG Completes Open Season With 3 Pacts 06/09/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group (CG) Friday completed its open season for firm liquid natural gas (LNG) tanker discharging service at its Cove Point terminal near Lusby, Md., the company said. Cove Point LNG executed binding agreements with Coral LNG Inc., El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, LP (EPG) and a subsidiary of BP Amoco Corp. (BPA). The three customers will begin service agreements upon receipt of regulatory approvals. The open season process for the proposed service began Feb. 16, with the new service providing 4.25 billion cubic feet of storage capacity and 750 million cubic feet per day of terminal and pipeline capacity to accommodate LNG imports by the three companies. The open season agreements also provide for a 2.5 Bcf (vapor equivalent) storage capacity expansion of Cove Point's Lusby, Md. location. Cove Point anticipates filing an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to provide the LNG tanker discharging service, to recommission Cove Point marine facilities and to construct new storage facilities including the new LNG storage. Columbia Energy Group agreed to sell partnership interests in Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership to Williams Cos. (WMB) subsidiaries for $150 million. The transaction should be complete in July, the companies said Friday. -By John Edmiston; Dow Jones Newswires, 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.com Folder Name: LNG Relevance Score on Scale of 100: 98 ______________________________________________________________________ To review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

Kathy Kelly EXCELLENT    The performance of the group in the area of operations/logistics is superior.  Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and is able to get performance form her people.  Even with the dramatic growth of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very high level of performance.  I think Kathy could improve in the commercial area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc.. Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of operations/logistics.  Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to operations/logistics.

thanks for the info. Tammi DePaolis@ENRON 06/13/2000 12:19 PM 
yes, I have seen the fertilizer companies back off their buying due to gas prices.    Terra Resources reduced their purchasing signficantly for the month of June, supposedly they bought no spot gas at all only term commitments.   There total load is around 200,000 but I do not know the mix up between spot and term.   Also CF Industries and Farmland (which are small gas buyers) reduced their volumes as well.    PCS initially reduced their voumes for thier Geismer facility but when gas prices dipped to upper 3.90s and low 4.00's they came in and bought the supples they had curtailed and are at max volumes. Thanks.

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70. By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70. By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

Unnatural  History [IMAGE] If you think  the market can't get much worse, history says you're  wrong. [IMAGE] OpenFund  Commentary [IMAGE] Indices analyzed in this post: Dow  Jones Industrials NASDAQ  Composite NASDAQ  100 NASDAQ  Volatility GSTI  Multimedia Networking GSTI  Semiconductor GSTI  Software AMEX  Biotechnology Russell  2000 Wilshire  TMV Light  Crude Oil Gold 30yr  Treasury Bonds Fed  Funds Futures [IMAGE] Live audio of this commentary: [IMAGE] Live video from our morning call: [IMAGE] After the last two horrible quarters, many of  us are probably telling ourselves that it can't get much worse than it's been.  For those of us who believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this. For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has had  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's fairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent commentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight. Over the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has been, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse. There were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. There were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single six-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an astonishing 52.92%. Of the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before 1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929. The worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the one ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the 1970s. The most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the one ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the 1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month period. This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no means as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time it  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 has  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 years. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. It can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went down further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an additional 18.24%. Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things getting  better. But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses. If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every day). - TOP.GIF - BOTTOM.GIF - audio.gif - vid.gif

Mr. Neal, I wrote you last week a request to spend some time talking to you about Enron's Energy Risk Management for a report I am writing on energy risk management applications.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I would just like a half hour to talk.  If you would like a list of questions, I would be happy to provide them. This conversation does not have to be on the record if you don't want it to.  The main purpose for my enquiry is to understand how energy risk applications are being used ""on the ground"".  I would like to be able to write about Enron, but it is not required. I look forward to hearing from you.

Andrea, The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your reference. thanks, Scott - new leo's resume.doc 
Also, send me a copy of your resume.  thanks. ""Kevin B Murray"" <kmurra1@lsu.edu> on 03/04/2001 12:20:04 PM 
Scott: Greetings from LSU.  I sent you an email a few weeks ago, but perhaps you didn't receive it.  No big deal. I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing.  My last semester is shaping up to be pretty tough.  The MBA class in Real Options is, to say the least, tough!  I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, and so far we've learned about Binomial trees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model, risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processes, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, and pricing American, European, and exotic options.  What's also great about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example of how this stuff works in the real world.  It's a great class! One of my other classes, Economic Forecasting, is challenging as well, because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time. Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I need to be doing. I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlighting lines on every page!  I figured I'd start with the less technical books first, considering my workload. I'm going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend, 3/9 - 3/11 with my roommate, Ed Brady, who will also be at Enron in July.  Let me know how your schedule looks, and maybe we can get together. Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new trading rotation that you spoke of is still a high probability.  As I'm learning more about options and futures in class, you're definitely right--I think trading is where I want to be! Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.  I hope all is well in Houston. Kevin 
All is well here.   It sounds like you are very busy.  I glad you are taking the options course - it will really benefit you.  Also,  Andrea Richards is the person I contacted with the Associate program to request that your first rotation be in the Trading group - so we should be in good shape on that front.  Her phone number is 713 853 6499 for your future reference.  Thanks for the email, I look forward to seeing you this summer. Scott ""Kevin B Murray"" <kmurra1@lsu.edu> on 03/04/2001 12:20:04 PM

Rockhounds & Parents, ? Looks like we'll be rained out this afternoon for batting cage  practice.? For tomorrow's practice we'll probably be unable to play on the  field due to standing water, or possibly continued rain, but, we will go ahead  and have a ""skull"" session at my house at 9:00am.? My address is 13611  Pinerock, just off of Yorkchester (between Wilchester and Kirkwood), 4 blocks  north of Memorial. ? The practice tomorrow will be 1 hour, from 9 till 10:00.?  See everyone then. ? Jeff 
Before you begin trading your EnronOnline products on March 1st ... Review the dates on your products. We are in the process of converting ""regular"" products to ""Tokenized Reference Period"" Products. A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system sees as ""Day Ahead"", ""Month Ahead"", ""Month Ahead +1"", etc - but this is not what you or your customers see.   At midnight every night, the system checks the current date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For example, if Product #20451 is ""Month+1"", then on Feb. 28, the Short Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show ""April1-30"". However, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product #20451 to show ""May1-31"".  Note that the Product number stays the same, but the date has automatically updated. When all of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine - your links all stay on the same relative date (links are between Product Numbers, not between Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it might look like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the same Product all the time - only the date changed). Believe it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods will make your life easier in the long run - you will not have to continually create new Products and links. Links between Products which share the same dates should continue in effect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together. The important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have Rolling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates will continue to change automatically on the 1st day of each new month. For example: On Feb. 28, the ""Prompt Month"" product will be March; but on March 1, it will become April, etc. On Feb. 28, the ""Prompt +1 Month"" product will be April; but on March 1, it will become May. etc. To verify if your product has a Tokenized Reference Period or if it has a specific date, please review your product in Product Manager under the 1st tab marked ""Product Details.""   Your product will be ""Tokenized"" if it has the following applications:

Scott, I am talking to DTI (CNGT) regarding an Index minus sale for April-01 through  June-01 of up to 4 Bcf. I wanted to send my contact a brief description of how we would go about achieving an Index minus baseload price by imbedding an option.  I am not supposed to know about DTI's potential purchase requirements, so I changed the quantities and months in the example below, since the plan is to take this to her boss. Please let me know if this sounds OK or give me pointers on making it better. Tammi, As promised I wanted to send you a simplified example of how we can guarantee you IF-FOM Index Gas you can take to Michelle. Example:  Note: All prices are notional non-transactable numbers. DTI requires a total of 610,000 DT in April and May as a 10,000 DT/d baseload purchase. ENA Proposal would guarantee DTI IF-FOM Index Minus Gas by embedding an option (Put or Call) into the deal for say 5,000 DT/d. Therefore if DTI has the flexibility to take up to 915,000 DT (in the case of the put) or as little as 305,000 DT (in the case of a call) then ENA can take the value of the option and imbed that into the price of the gas. Let us say; ENA is currently offered at IF - CNG App Index for  April and May @ Index +2 cents, and agrees to sell DTI Index  -2 cents; ENA has lost 4 cents or $0.04 * 610,000 = $24,400. However, if we price in the value of a call option with a strike price of the FOM Index, then that would generate $0.10 * 5,000 * 61 days= $30,500. ENA would use this value to offset the Index loss and make a small margin on the sale.  Therefore DTI is guaranteed Index minus gas, however must have the flexibility to potentially take more or less gas than the baseload quantity. Remember, if the option is out of the money for the entire period, DTI will receive only the baseload quantity.  If ENA exercises the option everyday then DTI will receive the quantities mentioned above still at a price of Index -2 cents. This can work if you need a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed the option in three of the months and buy or sell the remainder in the fourth month at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month period.  Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option will generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guarantee. Please let me know if you have any questions.  If you would like me to do a conference call with Michelle just let me know. Thanks, Sean

Rockhounds & parents, ? Hey everyone, I've finally got the pre-season game  schedule.? I've attached the latest overall schedule (rev 2,?and in a  earlier version of Excell so hopefully it can be easily opened).? Please  let me know if this is a format problem for anyone, I can fax it and/or mail it  if you'll let me know. ? Basically the changes are that our games next week are  Tuesday (6:00 pm gametime?at Memorial Middle School field #3) and  Thursday (8:00 pm gametime at Spring Forest Field #2, our  regular practice field)? Also, I've upped the practice start time  next Saturday to 8:30 am going?till 10:30 (since our game?Tuesday the 6th will?wipe out our practice)?and corrected  the error on the time for the March 10th practice (thanks Trisha).? If  these games are rained out they will not be made up. ? By the way, I've got a practice scheduled for the March 10th  but I'm sure some will be out since that's the first part of SBISD spring  break.? Please let me know how many will be able to attend. ? I don't think this really applies to anyone on our team, by  just fyi:? the league has requested that parents not drop their kids off in  front of the fields (by driving down the dirt trail).? There is too much  kid traffic and they're worried about accidents.? Just keep to the parking  lot. ? See everyone this Tuesday at 7:30. ? thanks, Jeff - RHounds_sched_rev2.xls

Thank you so much for your time last week. David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several issues helpful for our own market. This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from our side of the pond. Best regards Andy 
(If you're not planning on going camping this weekend, please disregard this memo.) The basketball Gods have issued a technical foul to the Indian Guides by scheduling a late Friday night game for all the boys that had RSVP'd to go camping Friday night, so, here's Plan-B: The official start-up time is now Saturday afternoon.  Let's plan on a caravan to the campsite from Butch Butcher's house.  Let's meet there around 2:00 pm.  If you can't leave at that time (earlier or later), information on the campsites are available at the park entrance under ""Wilchester Indian Guides/Butcher"".  Depending on the outcome of the game Friday night, an earlier caravan may be going Saturday morning.  Stay close to your phones. As mentioned in earlier memo,  we will provide food for Saturday night ( hamburgers and fixin's for the boys).  If  Dads want something other than a burger, please feel free to bring a steak to throw on the grill.  We will also provide food for Sunday breakfast.  Please feel free to bring whatever snacks or drinks you want as well.  Remember to bring bikes, fishing stuff (optional), sporting goods, bug spray, camping stuff (I'm bringing an extra tent), cards, lottery tickets, ...  If you need help getting your bike to the park, call Butch (professional mover). Oh yeah, Directions (if you miss the caravan): From US-59, take Grand Parkway (TX-99)/Crabb River Rd exit and proceed South on Crabb River Rd.  Continue over RR tracks on TX-762 for about 15 miles and take left into Brazos Bend State Park entrance. From Clear Lake area (who's coming from Clear Lake ?) take either FM-517 or FM-528 to TX-35.  Proceed to FM 1462 west.  Take a right on TX-762 and the Park entrance is about 1 mile on the right. Yah-teh-hay! DB

The guy in B.A. that we booked our hunt with is Emilio Paris (phone # 011 541 14 812 2154).  We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about  45 minutes outside of Cordoba.  We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.  Our guide's name was Sergio Abrile.  We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.  We paid $9.00/box for shells.  We aleady had our guns,  however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. shotguns for rent for $25/day.  We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of fall and we slayed the birds.  I think the only time to avoid is during the heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.  The flight from Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour. You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.  I think he is affiliated with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.  I hope this info is helpful. Don't hesitate to call if have nay questions.

I talked to Scott Neal - he lived in BA for a few years and has attended and hosted bird hunts.  He is going to get me the names of some people he hunted with to compare prices, accommodations etc.  A few things he wanted us to check on; 1) BA is a hell of a long way to travel - is the flight bus. class? 2) What time of year are you planning on going - there are better times. Scott was thinking they hunted in May (he is going to check) and had as much shooting (and then some) as he needed. 3) Accommodations in BA and where you hunt.  Again he is going to verify and get some phone numbers but you want to stay close to where you are hunting (not like Mexico) and there are some very nice places - he is thinking he stayed at the Gauge Four Seasons. I will get back to you with more details as I have them. Thanks, Lee - 713-624-9065 (lhanse@br-inc.com) ---------- Original Text ----------

Hey, just wanted to say hi to you. I moved to SP 10 days ago. Very exiting city, don't you think so? Not many places to play golf here, but I will have to look better. Are you playing?? How are things going there? How is your desk doing this year? Things are difficult in the region - I believe you are aware of it - but as usual, we are trying hard. Well, just wanted to let you know thta I am in SP now, working for Remi Collonges. Lets keep in touch. Rolo 
Let's try to visit on Thursday or Friday in the afternoon. John Hodge@ENRON 02/09/2001 05:50 PM 
I was talking to Frank Vickers and he mentioned that you might want to talk about an opportunity on the trading side of the East group.  I just wanted to drop a note to let you know that I will be out of the office from Monday, Feb. 12 through Wednesday, Feb. 14.  However, I am eager to discuss any opportunities in trading.  Leave me a voice mail or just catch me at anytime on Thursday.

Brother Butcher and I are still in need of a final list of who's in and who's out for next weekend's Indian Guides camp-out at Brazos Bend state park.  Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hr away), most everyone (like me!) will be coming and going to meet other commitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE !!! To refresh your memories,  the itinerary for the weekend is get to the park Friday after school and set up before dark.  (For those who need to go down there later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will be at the entrance to the park.)  Once we get there, the activities are bicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boys playing grab-ass in general.  THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNER SATURDAY NIGHT,  A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT  AND BREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.  For food purposes, we need to know an accurate headcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help getting your bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer (or something).  We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lottery tickets, ... when we get there.  Maps for those who need them will be provided next week. Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags, flashlights,lanterns, etc.  Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks. Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.  We'll make the final call on that by Thursday. To date, below is the headcount: Friday Night   Saturday Night Fallick        ?         ? Stehr          ?         Yes Byrd      ?

Susan, I don't know if such a letter exists.  Tom, do you know - also, who might be able to help Susan with the information requested below? Susan Elledge @ ENRON 02/06/2001 01:33 PM 
Hello Scott, I recently received a request from Entex to provide a list of active contracts between ENA and Reliant Entex.  I have come across a file containing more than one contract for them, specifically the Natural Gas Services Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001983, dated 9/1/93), and the Natural Gas Sales Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001980, dated 9/1/93).  By letters from you dated 2/21/97, both of these contracts' terms were extended to 3/31/00. Additionally, there is a letter dated 1/13/00 extending the term of the Services Agreement to10/31/02.  I would like to know if there was a 1/13/00 letter extending the term of the Sales Agreement.  If there was, I need to get a copy for the file, and make the amendment in Global Contracts. Thanks for your help.  If you have any questions, please give me a call. Susan Elledge 5-9989

As you know, Mog has been selected for the trading track program.  Her initial rotation is scheduled to be in the structuring group with a follow-up rotation in the back room.  However, she would like to do her initial trading-track rotation in the middle-marketing group.  She would be supporting the New York office (in Houston) where she would be assisting Per Sekse and Carolyn Abramo, marketing to and executing on behalf of commodity hedge funds.  I think this rotation would be very valuable in her trading-track rotation.  After her rotation in this group, she would then proceed with subsequent rotations as previously scheduled.  Since those of you noted above had already agreed on the rotation schedule, John Lavorato asked me to secure your agreement for this change.  He is agreeable provided those of you noted are in agreement as well.  The middle-marketing group would greatly welcome Mog and as I mentioned, I feel this rotation would be very valuable to her as a potential trader in the future.  If I do not receive an objection by Thursday, 5:00 P.M. - I will assume we can proceed ahead.  Thanks for your cooperation. 
please add to my schedule.

The latest appointment in the evening will work if it is at all possible for Scott to meet during that time.  If I can even get 30 minutes I would be greatly indebted to you and Scott forever.  If not, is there anyone else on the trading floor able to give me some time. Please advise as soon as possible? Thanks, Geynille

We will be contributing to this index, which will show prices similar to those currently available in the EnronOnline Content section under ""EnronOnline Price Reports"". If you or others in your organization get questions from customers or media, please refer to the following points regarding the message we're trying to promote: An increasing number of transactions done online are proving the ""staying-power"" of the platforms and are legitimizing transaction data from them. Ideally, these numbers should be audited before being given to the publications so as to minimize reporting errors.  EnronOnline's numbers are audited by Arthur Andersen on a periodic basis.

California Power Plants Get Jolt As Natural-Gas Supplies Are  Cut By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is putting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S. burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than gas  and generally has been costlier. In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into  a gas problem. One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas and  electricity affect each other. ""We don't just need new generating plants and  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,"" said Terry Winter, chief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. ""You

We will get working on this. I have no problem with you sitting in on the PRC process.  We are scheduled to have this meeting on Nov. 29, however I think there is some chance this date might change due to bid week activities. Frank W Vickers 11/12/2000 02:16 PM 
Scott, great to see you last week even if it was only for a short period.  I hear that the Org announcement is scheduled for Tuesday November 14th at 3:00.  Have you heard the same ?  I will be back in Houston early next week for the announcement.  I suggest that you and I plan to meet with the group either immediately after the announcement or perhaps after trading the following day.  I tend to think that the next day may be better. In addition, as we discussed I would like to get one of the analysts/associates working on pulling the following information together. List of our states.  maybe there is some overlap with the mid-west but as you know this new organization will have everyone focused and we do not want any confusion. Master list of ALL gas users within those states.  If there are any LDC's etc. that cross state boundaries or cross regional boundaries we will need to know that and make sure Enron coverage is appropriately assigned.  Delainey continues to say that he wants to make sure that everyone is covered and nothing falls through the cracks. From the master list we can determine our current level of business and relationship with that particular market, high, medium, low. From Master list we can determine 2001 assignments. This is fundamental but important in my opinion. Another issue that I was thinking about is that it would be helpful for me to sit in on this years PRC for all members of our staff.  I will not add anything but it will give me a sense of how they are doing and what to expect as we move forward.  Do you approve of that ?  When is that scheduled ? I did not get the metrics from Janet yet but am scheduled to do that when I am in next week.  I will get you a copy at that time. Thanks Frank 
I have prepared  a recommendation letter as  you have requested.  It is my pleasure to do so.  Please advise as to when to send, etc.  I am available to visit on the phone any time after 2:3opm any day this week.  However, I will be out of the office on Thursday and Friday Nov. 16-17.

I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating. I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her and I agree with your comments. Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading. Sincerely, Scott Neal Chip Ryan <cryan@lsu.edu> on 10/19/2000 07:30:58 PM 
Hi Geynille and Scott, I wanted to thank you for lunch today and tell you how much I enjoyed meeting you.  Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to make our classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students.  We appreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuable contribution. One of my former students, Milagros Daetz, dropped by to see met later in the day to tell me about her Enron interviews.  Milagros was very excited about Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met.  I want to offer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf.  Milagros is one of the most impressive students I have ever taught.  While her GPA (3.9) is sufficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to comment on her intangible qualities.  Milagros is mentally tough, hard working, determined, and ambitious.  Just as important, she is a genuinely nice person.  She deals with people very well and possesses what I would describe as quiet leadership characteristics.  In other words,  she leads by example and by reason.  I also find her to be mature beyond her age and willing to assume responsibility for her own choices.  In short, I think Milagros would be an asset to any organization. Again,  it was good meeting you.  Please fell free to contact me if I can help you in any way. Regards, Chip Ryan Assistant Professor of Finance E. J.
