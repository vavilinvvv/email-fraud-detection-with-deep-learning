The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure.

The expert firm alleges they were ""retained...to explain, research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] ...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services."" After alleging that the Hendricks attorneys ""refused to pay Plaintiffs' first billing""  it is alleged that""defendants' refusal may have resulted from the conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis."" We should consider if there is there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward.

Are you kidding? It is Columbus day-- there is no one to be found at the PUC. Jeff Dasovich@ENRON 10/09/2000 10:57 AM 
Greetings: Any word about whether the PUC bought our proposal? Best, Jeff 
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options: 1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage. 3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10. 4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large, but just not the cost or expense side. 5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999) than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00 report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal objections and sit back and  wait. 6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority. 7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level. 8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v. New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging, anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority. 9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions. Hope this is helpful.

DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999) than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00 report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal objections and sit back and  wait. 6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority. 7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level. 8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v. New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging, anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority. 9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions. Hope this is helpful.

We should consider if there is there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion.

John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter. He called me, learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved. I have attached the Boies firm response. I think the danger of allowing the Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release. The release may be shortlived.  Enron could be added to Quinque or a Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts?

Hello Energyphiles: OK, perhaps it was inevitable.  But it is now official.  A team of San Diego's best anti-trust and class action attorneys has been assembled to take on the electric generators and marketers in California state court in an effort to return the electricity overcharges that have battered San Diego and the rest of California this year.    A press conference will be held to discuss the consumer class action lawsuit to be filed today.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows: I. NATURE OF THE CASE 1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders, including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia, improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion. 2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California. 3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union Tribune:  ""The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19 cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of 
Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses 11/29/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity service. On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy.

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses 11/29/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity service. On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows: I. NATURE OF THE CASE 1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders, including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia, improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion. 2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California. 3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union Tribune:  ""The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19 cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of 
If EGLI is sued, this will be our case. I have been involved because we knew this extortion was coming one day. I would recommend that we not settle. This is a message case for me. We need to send a message to all plaintiff's attys that Enron doesn't settle simply to avoid the cost of litigation. With the Litigation Unit defending this case, our cost will be below $30,000. Let me know what you think. 
On July 2, 1999 I sent counsel for the Plaintiffs a letter wherein I again urged them to dismiss Enron Products Pipeline from the captioned litigation. I received a telephone call this afternoon from David Carlile.  Mr. Carlile advised that he will dismiss EPP from this litigation.  Mr. Carlile then advised that Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. sold a large quantity of propane to the facility and in the event that a settlement was not reached he would bring EGLI into the litigation. As the conversation went along, Mr. Carlile stated that propane is not his target defendant and that he would settle with us for $50.00 per plaintiff.  He then said that his bottom line is $30,000 which is the lowest sum he has taken from any of the settling parties. I advised David that I would relay the conversation to my clients and would get back with him in due course. In the interim, David is going to send me a letter along with a Non-Suit as to EPP. I would appreciate your thoughts on whether we should accept the settlement offer. - - EWK 
I have called TVA's in house counsel to determine how the press learned about

This is good news---for once. 
Richard, Mike Day just told me that he has obtained a 60 day extension for all proceedings before the PUC in the SCE case.  Thus, there will be no hearing on Thursday on our motion to dismiss.

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard and Elizabeth: While I was away on vacation, Steve Hall included this statement in a status report to me; "" >While you were gone I learned a new one from Smith Day, which involves submitting bids for less than one MW, i.e., .0005 MW.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options: 1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage. 3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10. 4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large, but just not the cost or expense side. 5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999) than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00 report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal objections and sit back and  wait. 6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority. 7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level. 8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v. New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging, anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority. 9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions. Hope this is helpful.

FYI 
Status Report re: tape transcripts At this time, this summary has been sent to you only. Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in exchange for our providing similar information to them. He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own equipment. As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover the period of September of 1999 to the end of October. The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999. With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question. We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in time, they have not responded to us. If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear. Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the flavour of the matter to our benefit. On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between Powerex and Enron. We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience. Yt Web Macdonald 
Richard -- Here is the FERC Order on California issues. Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their Subpoena?  Maybe we should ask Mike Day and Dan Watkiss for their opinion on this matter before we do anything else in terms of responding? Jim

Here are two of the articles.... Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says 11/23/0 9:44 (New York) Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both companies. The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and denied they had broken any laws. Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian power project valued at $136 million. Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.

All rights reserved. The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price fixing by the two companies. In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity exchange, Dow Jones reported. Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have been laid and denied breaking any laws. Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about the files. ""It remains just allegations,"" he said.

This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders, including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia, improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion. 2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California. 3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union Tribune:  ""The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant. . . .

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses 11/29/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity service. On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday morning in San Diego. Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold in the state. An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable to comment. The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

FYI 
Status Report re: tape transcripts At this time, this summary has been sent to you only. Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in exchange for our providing similar information to them. He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own equipment. As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover the period of September of 1999 to the end of October. The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999. With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question. We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in time, they have not responded to us. If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear. Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the flavour of the matter to our benefit. On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between Powerex and Enron. We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience. Yt Web Macdonald

Here are two of the articles.... Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says 11/23/0 9:44 (New York) Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both companies. The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and denied they had broken any laws. Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian power project valued at $136 million. Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.

All rights reserved. The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price fixing by the two companies. In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity exchange, Dow Jones reported. Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have been laid and denied breaking any laws. Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about the files. ""It remains just allegations,"" he said.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options: 1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage. 3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10. 4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large, but just not the cost or expense side. 5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999) than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00 report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal objections and sit back and  wait. 6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority. 7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level. 8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v. New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging, anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority. 9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions. Hope this is helpful.

Status Report re: tape transcripts At this time, this summary has been sent to you only. Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in exchange for our providing similar information to them. He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own equipment. As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover the period of September of 1999 to the end of October. The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999. With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question. We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in time, they have not responded to us. If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear. Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the flavour of the matter to our benefit. On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between Powerex and Enron. We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience. Yt Web Macdonald

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure.

FYI re: DOJ/CA Situation.  I'm not sure what to make of this in light of the upcoming change in the Administration, but I thought you would want to be aware of it.  Also, although the focus appears to be generators, I would assume that if DOJ elected to go forward andy investigation would be likely to expand to include major marketers.  John Friday December 15, 1:03 pm Eastern Time Justice Dept Asked to Probe Power Crisis WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has been asked to investigate whether possible collusion and other illegal activities among power generators are behind the huge jump in California's electricity and natural gas prices. ``We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers,'' California Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and California State Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton said in a letter to Reno late on Thursday. ``We request that the Department of Justice investigate potential collusion and any other unlawful acts by generators in the electricity market,'' they added. They noted in the letter that one-fourth of the state's generating plants -- representing 11,000 megawatts of power -- were shut down last weekend, allegedly for repairs or routine maintenance, when California citizens faced rolling blackouts. ``Some have suggested that one reason for plant shutdowns is that in some cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market,'' they said. If true, Boxer and Burton said it would explain some of the electricity shortage problems and raise concern about irregular activity in the natural gas market. In a related action, they sent letters to power company executives asking them to explain why their firms shut down generators while California faced power shortages. Wholesale electricity prices in the state have soared as high as $1,400 per megawatt hour. Boxer and Burton admitted time is running out for Reno to take action since a new attorney general will take the helm of the Justice Department when Republican George W. Bush assumes the presidency in late January. ``However, this crisis in upon us now,'' they said. ``I hope you will take immediate steps to address this matter, thereby setting a strong example of leadership for the new attorney general to follow.''

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options: 1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage. 3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10. 4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large, but just not the cost or expense side. 5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999) than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00 report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal objections and sit back and  wait. 6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority. 7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.

In a related action, they sent letters to power company executives asking them to explain why their firms shut down generators while California faced power shortages. Wholesale electricity prices in the state have soared as high as $1,400 per megawatt hour. Boxer and Burton admitted time is running out for Reno to take action since a new attorney general will take the helm of the Justice Department when Republican George W. Bush assumes the presidency in late January. ``However, this crisis in upon us now,'' they said. ``I hope you will take immediate steps to address this matter, thereby setting a strong example of leadership for the new attorney general to follow.''

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options: 1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage. 3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10. 4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large, but just not the cost or expense side. 5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999) than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00 report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal objections and sit back and  wait. 6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority. 7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level. 8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v. New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging, anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority. 9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions. Hope this is helpful.

FYI 
Status Report re: tape transcripts At this time, this summary has been sent to you only. Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in exchange for our providing similar information to them. He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own equipment. As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover the period of September of 1999 to the end of October. The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999. With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question. We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in time, they have not responded to us. If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear. Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the flavour of the matter to our benefit. On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between Powerex and Enron. We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience. Yt Web Macdonald 
I am forwarding a draft of the Amended Complaint in the TVA lawsuit. The ""control area"" causes of action have added to our existing request for declaratory relief on the ""delivery point"" issue. We would like to file this next week, so please review this asap. My assistant is putting together a conference call for Tues afternoon to discuss. 
FYI re: DOJ/CA Situation.  I'm not sure what to make of this in light of the upcoming change in the Administration, but I thought you would want to be aware of it.  Also, although the focus appears to be generators, I would assume that if DOJ elected to go forward andy investigation would be likely to expand to include major marketers.  John Friday December 15, 1:03 pm Eastern Time Justice Dept Asked to Probe Power Crisis WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has been asked to investigate whether possible collusion and other illegal activities among power generators are behind the huge jump in California's electricity and natural gas prices. ``We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers,'' California Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and California State Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton said in a letter to Reno late on Thursday. ``We request that the Department of Justice investigate potential collusion and any other unlawful acts by generators in the electricity market,'' they added. They noted in the letter that one-fourth of the state's generating plants -- representing 11,000 megawatts of power -- were shut down last weekend, allegedly for repairs or routine maintenance, when California citizens faced rolling blackouts. ``Some have suggested that one reason for plant shutdowns is that in some cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market,'' they said. If true, Boxer and Burton said it would explain some of the electricity shortage problems and raise concern about irregular activity in the natural gas market. In a related action, they sent letters to power company executives asking them to explain why their firms shut down generators while California faced power shortages. Wholesale electricity prices in the state have soared as high as $1,400 per megawatt hour. Boxer and Burton admitted time is running out for Reno to take action since a new attorney general will take the helm of the Justice Department when Republican George W. Bush assumes the presidency in late January. ``However, this crisis in upon us now,'' they said. ``I hope you will take immediate steps to address this matter, thereby setting a strong example of leadership for the new attorney general to follow.''

Any thoughts? 
The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were ""retained...to explain, research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] ...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services."" After alleging that the Hendricks attorneys ""refused to pay Plaintiffs' first billing""  it is alleged that""defendants' refusal may have resulted from the conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis."" We should consider if there is there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward.

Also, although the focus appears to be generators, I would assume that if DOJ elected to go forward andy investigation would be likely to expand to include major marketers.  John Friday December 15, 1:03 pm Eastern Time Justice Dept Asked to Probe Power Crisis WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has been asked to investigate whether possible collusion and other illegal activities among power generators are behind the huge jump in California's electricity and natural gas prices. ``We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers,'' California Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and California State Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton said in a letter to Reno late on Thursday. ``We request that the Department of Justice investigate potential collusion and any other unlawful acts by generators in the electricity market,'' they added. They noted in the letter that one-fourth of the state's generating plants -- representing 11,000 megawatts of power -- were shut down last weekend, allegedly for repairs or routine maintenance, when California citizens faced rolling blackouts. ``Some have suggested that one reason for plant shutdowns is that in some cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market,'' they said. If true, Boxer and Burton said it would explain some of the electricity shortage problems and raise concern about irregular activity in the natural gas market. In a related action, they sent letters to power company executives asking them to explain why their firms shut down generators while California faced power shortages. Wholesale electricity prices in the state have soared as high as $1,400 per megawatt hour. Boxer and Burton admitted time is running out for Reno to take action since a new attorney general will take the helm of the Justice Department when Republican George W. Bush assumes the presidency in late January. ``However, this crisis in upon us now,'' they said. ``I hope you will take immediate steps to address this matter, thereby setting a strong example of leadership for the new attorney general to follow.''

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options: 1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage. 3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10. 4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large, but just not the cost or expense side. 5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999) than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00 report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal objections and sit back and  wait. 6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority. 7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level. 8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v. New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging, anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority. 9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions. Hope this is helpful.

FYI 
Status Report re: tape transcripts At this time, this summary has been sent to you only. Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in exchange for our providing similar information to them. He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own equipment. As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover the period of September of 1999 to the end of October. The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999. With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question. We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in time, they have not responded to us. If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear. Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the flavour of the matter to our benefit. On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between Powerex and Enron. We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience. Yt Web Macdonald

As I indicated in my VM, I will be in LA early Tues morning. Would you like to talk about the isuues before your meeting--or would you like me to go? 
Williams, Reliant, Enron, Duke, AES, Dynegy, Mirant and Sempra have been invited to a meeting with the Governor.  The press release provides: ""The 
Any thoughts? 
The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were ""retained...to explain, research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] ...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services."" After alleging that the Hendricks attorneys ""refused to pay Plaintiffs' first billing""  it is alleged that""defendants' refusal may have resulted from the conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis."" We should consider if there is there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Do I need to get involved? Kay Mann@ENRON 01/22/2001 04:50 PM 
Yes, this is issue is still around. Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have? Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it have some greater significance? Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a sanity check. Thanks, Kay ""Thomas Hetherington"" <thetherington@bracepatt.com> on 12/19/2000 09:47:11 AM

I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the process of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular has Enron completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to file something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the possibility is out there. ============================================================================== This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

I have reviewed the proposed filings with FERC, at least the latest drafts. There were two issues related to the definition of market power and the proposal for penalties for underscheduling load that I believed needed to be changed and they were.  I believe those documents will be filed in the next few hours. As to CPUC, Harvey Morris has been tied up on the PUC's FERC filing and has not called us.  Mike Day anticipates a call early Monday.   So far, no news is good news. If you need to reach me this holiday, I will be at our house in Inverness, California.  (415) 669-1531 and I will check email periodically.

The status of the case has not changed. On Monday the 27th the court will hear our Motion for Summary Judgement on liability. We expect to win. Badack is contesting the damages and we will be required to endure some discovery. I predict we will have a judgement that we can excecute on by the 1st Q. Badack has increased its settlement offer to $2.4 million. We have offered $4.5 million. William S Bradford 11/20/2000 07:56 PM 
Badak is still in dispute.  Our litigation team headed by Richard Sanders is still negotiating with the company on some possible settlement.  We may need to write this balance down at some point.  I am not sure when to expect resolution to our negotiations. We will keep you posted as it progresses. Bill Brant Reves 11/20/2000 01:08 PM

Brant - Can you give us an update on Badak?  Thanks.

Lisa/Richard/Bonnie, Please give me an update of the following bankruptcy claims.  We need to make a determination if we should write off these receivables but would like to get input from you on any potential recovery before we move forward.  On a broader issue, do you have any report outlining outstanding bankruptcy preceedings or litigation that I may get a copy of on a regular basis so we can more effectively manage the credit and workout related issues on the trading portfolio? Please advise. Bill 
yes Britt Davis@ENRON 11/21/2000 09:07 AM 
Richard, I have not heard from you re this bill.  May I have your authority to pay it?  Casabonne has already called me about its status.  Thanks. Britt 
Richard, I have just received an invoice from Christophe Casabonne, the former EGLI trader who is our star witness/consultant in this matter, in the amount of 15,600 FF.  This represents 19 hours and 30 minutes at the agreed-upon rate of 800 FF.  Although I have not checked today, the USD/FF conversion ratio was about 1/7 a few weeks ago.  If something like this still holds, the bill is for about $2,230.00. I have reviewed the bill, find it in order, and ask for your authority to pay it. I await your instructions. Britt 
Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no absolute statement regarding pricing errors, but does commit to the validity of ""in the market"" online trades. I do want to check the audio tapes to review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the

Here are two of the articles.... Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says 11/23/0 9:44 (New York) Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both companies. The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and denied they had broken any laws. Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian power project valued at $136 million. Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority. (Globe and Mail, B1, 11/23) Report on Business: Canadian Competition cops raided power firms Evidence of electricity price fixing sought in Enron , Powerex offices, warrant shows LILY NGUYEN AND PETER KENNEDY ? 11/23/2000 The Globe and Mail Metro Page B1 All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors. All rights reserved. The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price fixing by the two companies. In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity exchange, Dow Jones reported. Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have been laid and denied breaking any laws. Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about the files. ""It remains just allegations,"" he said.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions. And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities. ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets. Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below. Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer. Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions: Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman. Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman. Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES. In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions: Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President= and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20 Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20 Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20 Americas. Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer. Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the= =20 commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20 equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products. Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged. Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS. To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows: Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized = on a=20 regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in= =20 the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all= =20 European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin= ue=20 to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions= =20 and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi= ef=20 of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region= al=20 basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20 Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue= =20 in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble= r=20 will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as= =20 well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.= =20 These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship= =20 to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications. Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co= ver=20 EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America. Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20 Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization= =20 continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes. ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AND ENRON WIND As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen= ts=20 around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to= =20 EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif= f=20 Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E= nron=20 Wind, will report to Cliff. CORPORATE STAFF We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20 Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In= =20 that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and= =20 Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an= d=20 Chief of Staff. COMMITTEE STRUCTURE In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s= =20 growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20 business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to= =20 be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a= nd=20 the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20 drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20 performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. = =20 The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list. We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit= tee. =20 This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20 management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20 Committee membership is also shown on the attached list. We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital = to=20 our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20 supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

In the three years I have been here, I am unaware of an ENA/ECT bad faith claim against any insurance company. Anyone else? If so, please contact Michelle. 
Justin, I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here.  I've read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations appropriately. Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed??  We sued Houston Casualty last year but I don't recall making any bad faith claims.  It settled anyway, a long time ago. mb ""Williams, Justin"" <justin.williams@linklaters.com> on 11/28/2000 12:18:12 PM 
Address this to Robin Gibbs for my signature. Thanks.

Dear Mr. Sanders - ? While I left a you a phone message with some information about  our project, I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as  well... ? We are still very interested in having Enron support our  eCommerce Dispute Management Protocol.? We have had enthusiastic responses  from companies such as AT&T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler,  and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal  point for our educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however,  is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational  statements of the Protocol. I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for eCommerce  B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small working  groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service  offerings. Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our  technology consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half  a day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from  finance, legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback  about our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for discussion at the meeting. The real focus of the meeting will be on how  we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B  marketplaces.? We are very concerned with providing services that are  relevant to that environment. We would like to meet between November 14  and?December 1?since construction of our services is already  underway.? Please let me know what is possible, and feel free to give me a  call if you have any questions (978-376-9004). ? Thanks. -> Gerry Gerry Strathmann eCommerce Group American Arbitration  Association

During the spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders, including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia, improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion. 2.

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses 11/29/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity service. On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday morning in San Diego. Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold in the state. An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable to comment. The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders, including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia, improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion. 2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California. 3.

My first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative. It seems like alot of busywork.  My second reaction was to recognize that Enron has a long term strategy of getting to know the insiders at AAA better, so there is some benefit to the meeting. However,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda or our business people(and lawyers) will lose patience quickly. The transactional lawyer who is responsible for EnronOnline is Mark Taylor ext 37459. I explained what was going on and he is expecting you call. Michelle Blaine@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 11/29/2000 11:15 AM 
Talked with Gerry today and he and his group are coming to meet with me next week.  He suggested we get a ""business type"" involved.  Since this is B2B oriented can you suggest someone from Louise Kitchen's group (aren't they doing the B2B internet transactions?) Should I just contact someone in her group directly? 
Dear Mr. Sanders - ? While I left a you a phone message with some information about  our project, I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as  well... ? We are still very interested in having Enron support our  eCommerce Dispute Management Protocol.? We have had enthusiastic responses  from companies such as AT&T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler,  and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal  point for our educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however,  is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational  statements of the Protocol. I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for eCommerce  B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small working  groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service  offerings. Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our  technology consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half  a day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from  finance, legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback  about our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for discussion at the meeting. The real focus of the meeting will be on how  we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B  marketplaces.? We are very concerned with providing services that are  relevant to that environment. We would like to meet between November 14  and?December 1?since construction of our services is already  underway.? Please let me know what is possible, and feel free to give me a  call if you have any questions (978-376-9004). ? Thanks. -> Gerry Gerry Strathmann eCommerce Group American Arbitration  Association (978) 376-9004 
Richard, Please let me know how you want me to answer the question posed at the end of the attached e-mail. Britt 
Richard, I have confirmed with David Best this morning that the settlement in this matter is ""done and dusted"", to use David's phrase.  I have received, and will shortly send to you, a letter from our underwriters' counsel, confirming the settlement.  Payment will be made within twenty-one days, which means before year-end.  Our barrister and expert have been advised to stop work immediately.  Parenthetically, we were able to avoid becoming liable for the 7,500 pound advance to our barrister that would have otherwise come due last Friday. Let me know if you want me to participate in a conference with John Nowlan to explain our reasons for the settlement.  By the way, this finally wraps up all the M/V HAVMANN arbitration/litigation.  Best advises that there is no one left for us to pursue, and no one left who is pursuing us. One question:  Best wants to know if you want the $475,000 to come directly to us, or to come to him, and to be disbursed to us by him net of agreed fees and expenses that we owe.  One way or another, I assume that you ultimately want the money wired to us, but I wonder if you know of a person (or department) from whom to determine the proper wire transfer account/address. If not, I am sure that I can find out.  Thanks. Britt 
Can you confirm that we corrected this?

Can you call him about this? I wouldn't worry too much about the tone of this letter or stepping on his toes. Jim overreacts at times. 
I don't know what precipitated the onslaught of questions, but as Corporate Risk Management is the business charged with the responsibility of dealing with United India, one of only four Indian insurance companies, and because we have a sizable book of business there and anticipate more,  I need to be brought into the loop on what the problem is or what the allegations are about. I believe that I am aware of all of the lawsuits filed by various Enron entities against insurance companies since 1986, and only one of those was filed in Texas.  I believe that Michelle has already addressed that

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION I am on a conference call and will be tied up until later this afternoon. Will you be around at about 3:00? 
Do you know this canidate from your Jackson Walker days? 
Attached is a copy of Dee's resume.  She is scheduled to meet with you, Michelle, at noon on Thursday. Please let me know if you need any additional information. 
Richard -- Here is the FERC Order on California issues. Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their Subpoena?  Maybe we should ask Mike Day and Dan Watkiss for their opinion on this matter before we do anything else in terms of responding? Jim 
The order issued from today's meeting is attached.  It is approximately 80 pages. - EL00-95.1 
Richard and Elizabeth, At Christian's suggestion, I am sending a memo I prepared summarizing some of the more exotic strategies used by our traders.  Christian has reviewed the memorandum and believes that it will assist you both in preparing for our Thursday meeting.  Between now and Thursday, Christian and I are going to analyze the ISO tariff to determine if the tariff prohibits any of these strategies. Steve 
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE Richard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on options: 1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed, then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our formal objections as well. 2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive advantage. 3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF DATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of California data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10. 4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be quite large, but just not the cost or expense side. 5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999) than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00 report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal objections and sit back and  wait. 6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California constitutional contempt authority. 7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the PUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our objections might be at the ALJ level. 8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v. New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging, anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority. 9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and not able to participate in any change of direction discussions. Hope this is helpful.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT Harvey Morris Esq. California Public Utilities Commission 505 Public Utilities Commission San Francisco, California   94102 Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (""EPMI""), Enron Energy Services Inc. (""EESI""), Enron Energy Marketing Corporation (""EEMC""), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO) and Portland General Electric Corporation (""Portland General"")(collectively sometimes referred to as the ""Enron Entities"") Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities' production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter ""the Commission"").  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, these entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary. For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges. GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called ""family trees"" to show its current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories or so called ""family trees"" for earlier periods it will also make those available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000. Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Data will identify its customers and suppliers. FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests 7 through 11 The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, ESSI, and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the transaction data in the second wave of document productions. GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation facilities are very small and there will probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions. For Portland General, there will be a very large volume of documents and we propose to handle them differently.  First, Portland General will provide for year 2000 electronic data in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant.  With respect to specific generating cost data, because of the volume, we suggest that these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Request 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX. EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is purchase or sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.  The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business.  EESI can also provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number.  Many of ESSI's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object. ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.  We anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document productions. FERC DOCUMENTS Request 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13, 2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself.

Enron 
Enron Today, Friday, Gary Fergus of the Brobeck firm and I met with Attny. Harvey Morris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the five subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   We negotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus an opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of the request for production of documents.   This will include a further extension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as a reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  We are working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team in Portland on further refining both responses and potential objections. However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office and senior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications, Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with the CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating the overall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extreme pressure the Commission was under to ""get to the bottom"" of what was happening in the California power markets.  He also recited that ""many parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the Governor"".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of cooperating would ""be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties"" which would be made available to the Governor and legislators and that such parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions. This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC. I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never invoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do so by CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I responded that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery requests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This comment speaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achieve a politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enron officials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of this incident. 
Here it is: I have some dope on the judge as well.  He was a very small time lawyer out in La Mesa (the sticks) with a general practice that  included litigation. He was a family law judge until he was made an overflow general civil judge in 1998.  None of the lawyers whom I have listed would be likely to have a relationship with him from their days in practice.  Also, he may not keep the case, given its high profile, and the fact that it is related to the case filed against the generators, which has a lower number.  People who know Judge Meyer say he is pompous and not very bright. He practiced with three lawyers. One of them went on the bench and is now retired.  Another has also retired.  The remaining one is LeRoy Knutson, who is of counsel in a small firm in El Cajon, also the sticks.

I have reviewed the response and I agree with the ""home run"" approach. I want to make sure that you and Robin are completely comfortable with this document since we may see it again. ""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/30/2000 10:27 PM 
FYI. Here is the last draft of the responses to FERC's questions.  It is still missing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting.  I believe that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft. He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego litigation.  In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC to specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory. Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate the problem.  There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it, that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there has been preemption.  As a practical matter, however, our preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti-trust laws, for example, the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway.  Ron and Mary clearly believe this is the one chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.  If FERC does make the finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.  I do not know how to assess the likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding, and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit analysis. If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditional phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:  ""if they were not in

Attached is the discussion of our net earnings for question 2.  I also did a little tinkering with the last paragraph from the last version I sent.  I haven't looked at Ron's proposal yet so if Ron rewrote this paragraph I may want to defer to what he said or figure out how to ""simonize"" (ha ha) the two.  Sorry to send this to you so late.

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine. Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest. Lisa King 11/15/2000 02:19 PM 
John- Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 (October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with my thinking. Thank you, Lisa

Travis, I reviewed an ""Agreement for Project Services"" having an effective date of May 20, 1999 and a ""Project Work Description"" (PWD) with a date in the title of May 27, 1999, which includes an Attachment A.  The PWD and its Attachment A apparently modify the 5/20/99 agreement, but reference it as the 5/21/99 agreement in the preamble and above the signature line.  The 5/20/99 agreement conveys (in paragraphs 4.8.1 and 4.8.2) any intellectual property rights that Agency.com may have acquired to Enron Corp.  Attachment A, however, added a paragraph 4.10 that begins with the following sentence: ""Company shall obtain no intellectual property rights to the Work unless it

I have reviewed a copy of the notice and summons which were served on ENA by Blue Grass Synfuels, et al.  I notice that there was no complaint served with the summons.  I assume you will be engaging counsel in New York to represent ENA in this matter.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to assist. Also, if the complaint is ultimately served on our outside counsel (rather than through ordinary service of process) after ENA serves its Notice of Appearance, please make sure to send Corporate Risk Management (Jim Studdert) a copy of the Complaint, so that it can be reviewed for possible coverage.  I know the matter sounds like breach of contract, but it's worth having the insurance review done if any quasi-tort claims are made.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change= s=20 are intended to accomplish four key objectives: First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu= l=20 business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. = =20 This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20 around a relatively small strategic asset position. Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20 relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to= =20 directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units= =20 has become increasingly difficult. Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin= g=20 the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20 hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin= g=20 asset positions. And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to= =20 redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities. ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate= =20 our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20 businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20 coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to= =20 higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20 opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o= f=20 Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an= d=20 markets. Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European= =20 (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20 operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u= nit=20 as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me= rchant=20 businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this= =20 new structure as described below. Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum= e=20 the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20 currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office= =20 of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer. Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our= =20 international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi= p=20 positions: Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President= =20 and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit= y=20 for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N= orth=20 America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO= =20 will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20 report to the EWS Office of the Chairman. Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t= he=20 Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our= =20 broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region= =20 will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office = of=20 the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for= =20 Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi= ness=20 into Enron Global Assets in the near future. =20 Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined= =20 EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi= ll=20 focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20 attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to= =20 the EBS Office of the Chairman. Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE= S=20 to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or= der=20 to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20 facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for= =20 at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout= h=20 America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to= =20 the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20 transition, Jim will join EES. In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20 activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale= =20 businesses and the commercial support functions: Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President= and=20 CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20 Enron Americas Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for= =20 operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20 marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor= t=20 into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility= =20 for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20 America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20 Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20 Americas. Enron Europe The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust= ralia=20 and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John= =20 Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer. Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and= =20 CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20 responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20 exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20 associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to= =20 Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the= =20 commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20 equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products. Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM= ahon,=20 President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged. Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b= y,=20 the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in= =20 the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more= =20 efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS. To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across= =20 EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These= =20 newly defined roles are as follows: Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic= e=20 Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,= =20 with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20 President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat= ed=20 services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20 wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these= =20 services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will= =20 continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible= =20 for specific commodities and/or geographic locations. Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS. Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized = on a=20 regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in= =20 the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all= =20 European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin= ue=20 to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions= =20 and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi= ef=20 of Staff. Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region= al=20 basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20 Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue= =20 in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble= r=20 will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as= =20 well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.= =20 These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship= =20 to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications. Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co= ver=20 EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America. Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20 Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization= =20 continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes. ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AND ENRON WIND As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen= ts=20 around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to= =20 EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif= f=20 Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E= nron=20 Wind, will report to Cliff.

A Citgo gasoline pipeline was ruptured by our subcontractor (Wilde Construction) last May, near Luling TX.  Citgo has incurred aprox. $700k of cleanup costs.   We believe the costs should be shared by Citgo (for failing to correctly mark the line), Wilde (for negligently striking the line), and Bechtel ( for not being present as our construction manager, knowing that Wilde was working near the gasoline line).  The new complication:  The spill may prevent the proposed buyer from purchasing the 1000-odd acres parcel affected by the spill.  If that purchase doesn't go through, the attorney for the Mexican national landowner told me that the mortgage on the land would be foreclosed, and the landowner would bring an action for the lost purchase price ($1.3MM) (which I doubt he could fully recover, since he could sell the property for some lesser amount). I am setting up a mediation (of Citgo, Bechtel, and Wilde), where John Odam (our atty, with Mangham Hardy) would act as mediator.  The new info about the land claim may change that strategy. Would you like to manage this, or be somewhat involved, or not involved? Thanks, Kenton

This morning, I executed and telefaxed Enron Metals' agreement to defend and indemnify Scottsboro in this matter to Scottsboro.  I just received a voice-mail from Dean Vanek, Scottsboro's general counsel, who said that the agreement looked fine to him.  He has referred me to his attorney, Tom Walker, of Walker, Johnston, Barton and Powell, out of Birmingham.  Walker is Scottsboro's usual attorney.  I have left an urgent message with Walker, who is out of the office in a seminar today, and won't be back in until tomorrow, to call me immediately about getting an extension of time to answer in this matter from the plaintiff.  The answer date is Monday. Richard, given that Walker is not defending us, but Scottsboro, and the small size of this case ($15,000), do we need to pass this by Jim Derrick for his approval?  Given the short time frame before an answer is due, I will go forward with retaining him provisionally, at least to get an extension of time.  I would be strongly inclined not to substitute any other counsel in, as it might give away that it is Enron Metals who is funding Scottsboro in this matter. Britt 
FYI re: DOJ/CA Situation.  I'm not sure what to make of this in light of the upcoming change in the Administration, but I thought you would want to be aware of it.  Also, although the focus appears to be generators, I would assume that if DOJ elected to go forward andy investigation would be likely to expand to include major marketers.  John Friday December 15, 1:03 pm Eastern Time Justice Dept Asked to Probe Power Crisis WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has been asked to investigate whether possible collusion and other illegal activities among power generators are behind the huge jump in California's electricity and natural gas prices. ``We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers,'' California Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and California State Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton said in a letter to Reno late on Thursday. ``We request that the Department of Justice investigate potential collusion and any other unlawful acts by generators in the electricity market,'' they added. They noted in the letter that one-fourth of the state's generating plants -- representing 11,000 megawatts of power -- were shut down last weekend, allegedly for repairs or routine maintenance, when California citizens faced rolling blackouts. ``Some have suggested that one reason for plant shutdowns is that in some cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market,'' they said. If true, Boxer and Burton said it would explain some of the electricity shortage problems and raise concern about irregular activity in the natural gas market. In a related action, they sent letters to power company executives asking them to explain why their firms shut down generators while California faced power shortages. Wholesale electricity prices in the state have soared as high as $1,400 per megawatt hour. Boxer and Burton admitted time is running out for Reno to take action since a new attorney general will take the helm of the Justice Department when Republican George W. Bush assumes the presidency in late January. ``However, this crisis in upon us now,'' they said. ``I hope you will take immediate steps to address this matter, thereby setting a strong example of leadership for the new attorney general to follow.''

Hello, Mr. Sanders.  I am Marty Sunde's assistant and I am writing regarding the 11/22/00 letter from Palmer, Guest & Esses regarding Euell Energy Resources.  The letter was addressed to Mr. Lay and Marty Sunde in EES received a copy.  We sent the letter to our General Counsel, Vicki Sharp, who advises that she passed it on to you for handling.  As the 12/15/00 deadline (set forth in Mr. Esses' letter) is approaching, I thought I would follow up to see if a response has been provided to them.  If this has already been taken care of, would you be so kind as to fax a copy of the letter to us for our file.  Our fax number is (713) 646-2199. Please let me know.

David, Where are we?  I am out on vacation all next week, and haven't sent the below-referenced bills to Richard yet, as I do not want to bother Richard with approving them piece-meal.  I trust that you will shortly be receiving payment from underwriters and do not want to I delay getting you authority for netting out what Enron agrees it owes.  I greatly appreciate your immediate help. Britt 
1.  Please press whoever owes us their outstanding bills to get them to us as soon as possible. 2.  With regard to the Minton's bills, can you get me an itemized breakdown? 3.  With regard to the barrister's fees, can we get something that will allow us to determine how much time/what billing rate applies to each of these entries?  I am mindful and appreciative that he apparently hasn't billed us in four years. 4.  With regard to the arbitrator's fees and expenses, is any more detail available (total time spent/rate)? Many thanks for your immediate help. Britt

** PRIVATE ** Richard:   I've put on the fax to you a copy of 2 of our invoices for legal services on the Brazos FERC/Cert. matter--one from Sept. and one from November--that are still outstanding.  I thought in particular that the Sept. invoice may have been lost in the system since an invoice for the following month has been paid.   Also, I know that the Sept invoice had originally been sent to Dan Lyons since we also were doing related work on the Brazos project and Dan was the supervising attorney for the project overall, but my understanding from Dan was that he was going to send the litigation related invoice to your attention for your review and approval.  As you will recall from your Bracewell days, this is the time of the year that the internal law firm billing people hound the partners to follow up on outstanding bills.  Of course, if you have any questions on the invoice or need any further information, please do not hesitate to call me.  Thanks , Richard.  I hope that you are doing well and bearing up ok in the face of the day to day turmoil in CA.

Please send Vickie a copy of our schedule w/ attys. 
Item #11 (retained) has changed and needs to be updated on the schedule. Pintail has elected not to accept our proposal and has submitted termination under the contract.  Their future actions are unknown at this time. The potential arbitration proceedings with Shanghai needs to be added to the list as a retained litigation.  Contact Britt Davis for details. Item #3 (unretained) probably needs to clarify the current situation.  In this proceeding, it is my understanding that HPL has already condemned the property and posted the appropriate bond as per the Court order.  The landowners were not satisfied with the findings of the Commissioners and have filed suit seeking a higher value. It is unknown at this time whether there will be any litigation that comes

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication Since litigation has begun with Sempra, Somerset and Blue Grass, we should see to it that documents relating to the issues in the lawsuit are preserved.  For this purpose documents include not only hard copy but also documents and information in electronic form and on voice or video recordings. It may well be that you will have questions on how to implement this practice and more specifically what documents are covered. My suggestion is that we start by trying to see that documents are not discarded and determining what questions and issues there are.  Feel free to contact me for guidance as you go forward.  It may well be that we should have a conference call to see that everyone  is using the same procedures and to address common issues.  If you think that would be desirable let me know. We also need to see that other people who should get this notice have it forwarded to them so that Enron's compliance is complete. ======================================================= This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Richard, Please let me know what you want to do with these bills. Britt 
Richard, I have received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Mark D. Gately, now of Hogan and Hartson.  Gately was the lead partner on this file with Miles & Stockbridge before he changed firms toward the end of the case. He is billing us for 6.75 hours at $325 an hour, for a total of $2,193.75.  I find the bill in order and ask for your authority to place it in line for payment. I have also received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Miles & Stockbridge, for work done from October to date.  There are three timekeepers (with billing rates from $290 to $115 an hour) who charged a total of 17.70 hours, for total fees of $4,101, and total expenses of $1,1129.30, for a total bill of $ 5,230.00.  I find the bill in order and ask for your authority to place it in line for payment. Let me know if you wish to review either bill yourself, or whether you wish to pay the bills yourself. Britt

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine. Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest. Lisa King 11/15/2000 02:19 PM 
John- Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 (October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with my thinking. Thank you, Lisa

Please follow up w/ Paul. 
Richard this is paul comments re the note you sent a couple weeks ago re clyde and co. I support his conclusion. 
john, sorry it has taken so long to reply to the copy of the fax from clyde & co which you passed to me some time ago. basically, i reviewed the paper from sgs on copper corrosion contamination in lpg which reviewed possible scenarios of the lpg becoming off spec during a sea voyage. their conclusion was that propane which contained polysulphides could meet the copper corrosion tests at loading but then decompose during the long voyage to turn the propane off spec for copper corrosion. this position would support what clyde & co are saying as a factor against enron's case. the whole contamination problem, while possibly an inherent vice, was an unknown inherent vice. nobody was aware of this problem at the time of loadings but rather the problem came to light once some of the first ships reached their discharge ports. the sgs report also brings into account other reasons for the copper corrosion failure such as: a) unclean cargo tanks, containing sulfur from previous cargoes, b) mixing of two grades of lpg, both initially on spec, c) the use of unclean inert gas, and d) other incompatible corrosive cargoes (such as ammonia) by improper cleaning procedures. i did take the liberty to call chris clucas of dorchester maritime's technical department whom i met when dorchester was managing the enron owned ships. it was chris who initially sent me the sgs paper as an update to the gastech 1988 paper. it may be a good thing i did call him as he mentioned a subsequent paper issued by sgs in about 1998, by g.vermeiren, where sgs went to saudi to check their procedures during the time of these off spec cargo loadings. it appears the paper's conclusion is that unknowingly saudi may have put some pacifiers into the propane which would have caused the copper corrosion to show as on spec. therefore, the product could have actually been off spec before it was loaded but, due to the pacifiers, tested as on spec. in summary, i would agree with clyde & co that this should be settled, especially with the amount being discussed. i do not know where this claim stands and again apologize for the delayed reply. regards

Looks like 2/3 of the way down on pg. 2 he clearly says we have a deal pending the LC, a requirement which we later waved. Doug 
Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit). Thanks, Alan

Whatever happened with this?  Also--we need to caution the non-lawyers to be careful what they put in E-mails about this incident. Robert Quick 03/13/2000 09:37 AM 
there has been an HSE incident at Redcar in relation to a stockpile of Enron coal. We are still awaiting details and I will report as and when more information is available. I have discussed this with Michael, and it seems that almost certainly we will need to involve outside counsel. The firm that springs to mind having both coal and litigation experience is Linklaters. If anyone has any thoughts on this perhaps they wd let me know. tks Robert 
I agree with your comments that we cannot get out of our resposibilities and as such were obliged to provide the information.  Not to do so could have looked suspicious especially  when it is highly unlikely that their will be anything in the analysis document to show our coal to be more problematic than anyone else's.  As I said this morning, all fumes from coal fires are toxic and prolonged exposure will cause headaches, sickness etc..  This is not a function of the coal quality but of the combustion of the coal causing toxic gases. Consequently Mark Patten is concerned that Corus are not open to criticism for inadequate safety procedures and is trying to protect their own position.  Certainly the heating in the stockpile is to an extent due to the delay in moving the pile. Robert Quick 13/03/2000 14:56 
George, tks for this. I understand from Scott that the certificate was sent anyway this morning. The delivery terms under the confirm provide for site delivery so that the coal belongs to Enron. To that extent we cannot evade our responsibility. However, if the problems with the stockpile have arisen as a result of Mission not taking the coal, then we have an argument to say that the issue has been caused by EME not Enron. Let's find out more, and we may need to put Mission on notice. tks Robert 
Scott - please get with Robert Quick on this first.  This does not sound like something we want to get involved with. 
Greg-- We are not in the market right now. Her credentials are good, but her timing is bad. Thanks forthe resume. ""Gregory C. MacCrone"" <k-counsel@staffingsolutionsllc.com> 05/12/2000 05:08 PM 
Richard -- Just spoke with Sheila Tweed.  She said the company filled the slot for which we presented George Bernhardt and suggested I contact you about the company's attorney needs. We have an attorney who did a clerkship at Marathon Oil (Houston) while a University of Connecticut law student.  Since graduating in '94, he has gained legal experience solely in Moscow doing energy work while at international firms (including the London-based Denton Hall firm).  He has a project finance background which made me think of your team at Enron. Are these credentials which interest you and the company?  Please give me a ring or drop a line letting me know when you get a moment.  I appreciate. Best regards, Gm. -- Gregory C.

Richard, I left you a message about this issue on Tuesday.  I really need your input before we make the payments to Lynx.  Could we meet today sometime or talk on the phone? Thanks, 
Julie,  I'm working with Legal and Bob Surles with Lynx Energy Company on some pricing issues regarding meter 6677.  I have verified with Bob Fischer in the Transport Group the transportation rates that HPLC is paying to Gulf Coast Pipeline Company, which in turn must be paid to HPLC by Lynx Energy. Would you please change Sitara to reflect the transportation rates shown on the schedule below?  Also, I've recalculated the average price and need you to make those changes too. Thanks. Sitara Period Transport Rate Price 84425 07/99 $.10 $2.1847776 84425 08/99 $.10 $2.4957319 84425 09/99 $.10 $2.7938893 84425 10/99 $.10 $2.4148763 84425 11/99 $.10 $2.8992412 128331 12/99-02/00 $.10 HSC less $.10 166026 02/00-03/00 $.10 HSC less $.10 166026 04/00-fwd $.20 HSC less $.10 
Richard: I don't know if you were copied separately on this message.  Can you send a letter after Thanksgiving?  The first payment should come due the first week in December.  Thanks.  Sara 
Looks like 2/3 of the way down on pg. 2 he clearly says we have a deal pending the LC, a requirement which we later waved. Doug 
Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit). Thanks, Alan 
Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no absolute statement regarding pricing errors, but does commit to the validity of ""in the market"" online trades. I do want to check the audio tapes to review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the other events. I also feel this should significantly quiet their stance. 
I agree Mark Taylor 12/12/2000 06:59 PM 
My feeling is we stand by our confirmation - what do you think? 
Mark: This falls into your area.  I have spoke to William Kelly and advised that I am forwarding it to you. Thanks, Jeff 
On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 - March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM of revenue. Thanks, WK

As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my mind is that her aggression has ""empowered"" Linda's husband. It is pretty pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like""wait till I tell my lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge"" Linda needs someone that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the 
This is not a strong prospect.

Here is a copy of the e-mail I received from Larry Ruff before Christmas. Aleck 
Aleck -- I have not yet been paid for the work I did for Enron via Blakes.  I sent Blakes an invoice for about US$20,000 early in August -- yes, almost 5 months ago -- and have received nothing since.  I have asked Web MacDonald several times to check on it.  The last response I heard from Blakes was over a month ago, when they said they would remind Enron.  Then, about three weeks ago, I was asked by an attorney in San Francisco to assist him with some Enron work related to California.  I told him that, in my experience, Enron does not pay its bills, so he offered me an advance retainer.  He also said he had checked with the appropriate person at Enron in Houston, who said that he had just approved payment of my invoice.  But that was over three weeks ago and I still have seen nothing. My letter agreement is with Blakes, not Enron, so I had assumed that Blakes would pay me and invoice Enron themselves.  But Blakes seems unwilling to pay me themselves and unable to get Enron to pay me directly.  I would appreciate any assistance you can provide on this matter. Thanks, and do have a Merry Christmas. Larry assured him that my invoice which I agreed to do when he said he would pay a retainer in advance. - leruff.vcf

The main problem in getting him paid was that Blakes didn't send me his bill until Nov. We have processed the bill and he should have already received his money. I will call Larry today to apologize. Aleck Dadson 12/29/2000 01:56 PM 
Larry Ruff sent along a note indicating that his invoice  (US$20,000)  for consulting services re Stanley has not been paid, 5 months after it was first submitted to Blakes.  He was told by Web MacDonald of Blakes that it had been submitted to Enron Corp in Houston for payment.  Hopefully we can expedite payment.  Evidently Larry has been approached by Enron's California counsel to do some work out there for Enron and Larry insisted on a retainer given his experience on Stanley.   Regards, Aleck

Any thoughts on this question? 
Not only no, but hell no.  Once burned (badly), twice shy (exponentially). The best and only development on NSM I would like to see is to get out the litigation morass and (hopefully) be a little wiser next time. Seriously, if the project does get reorganized (sans Enron additional investment), what does that mean in terms of any potential recovery for the existing debt?  Presumably any reorganization would come out of a bankruptcy plan.  Any hope?

Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his daughter would  be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to handle it as a favor to me. At the time,  Felix had a job at a laundry company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on

I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business contact--a short and sweet letter should do. Dale Rasmussen 01/04/2001 03:11 PM 
Re-sending.  Hopefully you can print this one. In connection with the APEA matter, we have been informed that Avista (Avista manages Clark County PUD's gas supplies for its facility) has transaction tapes related to Clark's declaration of force majeure that may be of interest. It is possible that we should send a request to Avista to retain the tapes for the dates 12-6-00 through today in case a dispute arises over the declaration of force majeure.  Do you think that would be prudent, and if so, how would you like to go about making the request?

Company represents and warrants (i) that it is a successor corporation to Enron Milford, Inc., (ii) that the Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Certificate"") of Enron Milford, Inc. on file in the Division of Corporation Files of the Secretary of State, State of Delaware, applies to Company, and (iii) that the Certificate previously supplied to Consultant is a true, complete and correct copy of the Certificate.  Company hereby agrees to reasonably cooperate with Consultant if Consultant makes a claim under any of the provisions of the Certificate. Gary has also indicated to me that alternatively he would agree to accept this language: 5. Indemnification. Company represents and warrants (i) that it is a successor corporation to Enron Milford, Inc., (ii) that Company will abide by the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation (the""Certificate"") of Enron Milford, Inc. on file in the Division of Corporation Files of the Secretary of State, State of Delaware, and (iii) that the Certificate previously supplied to Consultant is a true, complete and correct copy of the Certificate.

Everything About Enron's Insurance Programs That You Were Afraid To Ask (or Didn't  Know to Ask) Presented by David Marshall Enron Corporate Risk Management Thursday, January 11, 2001 11:30 - 1:00 The Houston Room 601 Jefferson (We've reserved the Enron Shuttle to transport the ""non-walkers"") Lunch will be served.  Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282. One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of departmental information sharing activities.  Since we are faced on a daily basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation preferences.  It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday. Sorry for the inconvenient location.  We'll make it worth your while with the quality of the food and the presentation.

Richard - Gail's participation has been very helpful to this effort.  Her presence in Bombay will help us with the likely ""real time"" India action to be taken in the next week or so. Bruce 
Gentlemen - We are currently in the processing of serving/delivering the GOM Guarantee demand and the PPA Meet and Discuss Letter.  Ken Lay approved the delivery in a conference call this morning.  Our attention will then turn to the GOI Guarantee demand (can be served a week from today), the Notice of Arbitration under the GOM Guarantee and anticipation of injunctive relief being sought by our counterparties to stay any arbitration and collection/payment on the guarantees. We are scheduled to meet with the lenders in NY tomorrow. Bruce 
Jim/Mark - I know that Rob has been keeping you generally apprised, but I thought that I would update you both on the quickly evolving Dabhol situation. The commercial situation at Dahbol Power Company is deteriorating pretty rapidly.  MSEB is now approx. 45 days late on payment in full of the October invoice.  They have paid only a relatively modest portion of that bill. Payment on the November bill is about 15 days late.  The MSEB Chairman says that MSEB can't pay these invoices. At present, the Governments of Maharashtra and India are refusing to engage in a constructive dialogue on solving the non-payment issue and the 1400 MW that will come on line as part of Phase II.  They say that they recognize their obligations as guarantors of MSEB's obligations but are not interested in helping in any different capacity (e.g., GOI buys some or all of Phase II). Until just a few days ago, the lead India bank was refusing to fund even their own ongoing interest obligation.  At present, they are refusing to continue funding any other Phase II draw request.  The India banks have a great deal to lose and, in our opinion, should strongly consider continuing to fund Phase II.  It would seem that the lead India bank is scared, knaive or, worse yet, very pessimistic about Dabhol's future -- perhaps there are other reasons for their current position. We are meeting with the international banks in NY on Tuesday.  Our main goal is to convince them to continue to fund and to use their influence to have the India banks do the same. The current India legal crisis team is nearly identical to the 1995 India legal crisis team.  The same law firms and lawyers (both Indian and international) are continuing to play much the same roles. We have not identified any particular ""holes"" in Dabhol's legal position. While the India newspapers have offered up various theories that might allow MSEB to cancel the PPA (frustration of purpose, etc.), none seem compelling. No counterparty has offered up any of these theories directly to DPC. In the short term, we are preparing (1) a demand under the GOM guarantee and (2) a ""meet and discuss"" letter under the PPA.  The current plan is to serve these next week.  We are also preparing (3) an arbitration notice under the GOM guarantee, (4) a demand under the GOI guarantee and (5) an action against MERC.  MERC is the Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission.  They have issued ""orders"" over the last year limiting the amount of power that MESB buys from Dabhol.  We do not believe that they have jurisdiction to do so. We may or may not ultimately file this action. Let me know if I can provide any further information. Bruce

Richard, see Kirk's question below. 
Mary Thanks for setting up this meeting. It will have to be Thursday Morning for me or before 1:30 PM. I have to catch a flight to New York for business later that afternoon. Richard It was nice to meet you. Will we be able to review some possible transcript candidates on or before Jan. 11? Thanks Cheers Kirk Mary Clark@ENRON 01/05/2001 11:54 AM

Richard, Grant, here is the reply from ONEOK, clearly notice after the 20th. Would like to talk how we proceed. 
John I am in receipt of your letter concerning Mobil's election not to process its gas through Bushton for the month of January, 2001.  Below is a copy of the email received from Mobil concerning their gas election.   We are developing an estimate of the processing costs for ECT.  Will forward under seperate cover. In the future we will forward the Mobil notification when received. Thank you for your patience. Michael Belcher 
Per your request 
Tom, Please be advised ExxonMobil elects to bypass its gas at Bushton Plant for the month of January, 2001 for NGL recovery only.  We elect to continue recovering Helium for the month of January, 2001. Please acknowledge receipt of this processing election notice. Larry E.

Meeting Confirmation: Tuesday, January 09, 2001 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. EB9C1 (pending confirmation) EB857 (fallback location) Wednesday, January 10, 2001 8:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. EB9C1 (pending confirmation) EB857 (fallback location) Attendees: LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae team Vicki Sharp Mike D. Smith Bob Williams Richard Sanders Andy Edison Bill Bradford I will send out an e-mail on Tuesday by 10:30 a.m. confirming the location for these meetings.  If you have any questions, please call me. Thank you, Leasa Lopez Asst. to Vicki Sharp 
Attached is a preliminary agenda for the LeBoeuf meetings this week. I would like to propose that we have the LeBoeuf lawyers in the office midday Tuesday to meet with us Tuesday afternoon and then as much as Wednesday as necessary. I would assume we would want a core group of lawyers to attend all or substantially all of the meetings and then we would bring in business people as appropriate. I would also try to arrange the schedule to handle EES only or EWG only issues  in blocks. 1.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW  ASAP IF THIS SCHEDULE IS A PROBLEM. I know getting on everyone's calendar on short notice is a challenge.  Thanks in advance for your attention to this matter. 2.  John, can you highlight for me any areas where you expect business participation so we can start arranging our business people's schedules. 3.  EWG - who will take the lead on discussing the commercial agreements? 4.  Let me know if you have additional agenda topics. 5.  Jim, should we arrange some time on your calendar with the LeBoeuf lawyers? Please get me any suggestions, etc. Monday morning and we will work toward developing the final agenda for the meeting. 
Vicki: Attached is a draft of a proposed agenda for your consideration.  It has more things in it than a simple agenda, but I thought it may make some sense to be a little more inclusive in the ""bullets"" to make sure we cover as much as possible, from the standpoint of understanding or at least being aware of all of the moving parts in CA (CPUC, FERC, court litigations, etc.), while we have everyone together at this kick off meeting.  I would view the primary purpose of the meeting to obtain as much factual information as possible and to provide everyone with a general sense of the types of the considerations that would be likely to come up in the bankruptcy context. I am simultaneously sending this to our bankruptcy folks so I may have some additional comments or topics in the morning.  I also will send to you at that time a brief memo prepared by our bankruptcy lawyers that goes through some of the initial bankruptcy considerations, based upon our conversations on Friday. Please call me when you wish to follow up. John ""This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

Do you have everything you need? Russell Montgomery@ENRON 12/14/2000 09:54 AM 
Richard- I just wanted to follow up on my requests attached below.  Additionally, we haven't received a response from Gibbs & Bruns.  This isn't a problem right now as we are still probably at least a week away from signing an opinion.  I just wanted to keep you informed.  Let me know if I can send someone up to get copies of the documents.  Thanks for your help. Russ 
Richard- I have two requests that I hope you can help me with.  First, I wanted to see if there was an executed document removing Intrust.  If there is, I would like to get a copy of that.  Also, you mentioned a ""side letter"" agreement drawn up to allow the GPs to have the right to remove Intrust.  I would also like to get a copy of that document.  Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Russ 3-5297 
This will acknowledge receipt of the above.  This will be handled as an insurance-related matter, subject to any objections by our reinsurer, to 
Today's meeting will begin at 1:00 p.m. in EB872.  Thank you. 
What interest rate are we being charged? Britt Davis@ENRON 01/08/2001 09:55 AM 
Bernard, This will confirm our telephone conference of today and your telefax to me of today.  You confirmed that you had not mentioned settlement to Interfert's attorneys; I assume that Interfert's attorneys have not raised the subject with us either. You also confirmed that Enron has no obligation to pay anything based simply on Mr. Cornuot's final report, which will have to be considered by the Court of Appeals of Versailles before it can become legally binding, and that Enron would likely have no obligation to pay any additional amounts until approximately the middle of 2002.  You advised that the parties' pleadings regarding Mr. Cornuot's report were not due to be filed with the Court of Appeals of Versailles until October 1, 2001 and that supplemental pleadings could be filed until January 17, 2002.  Oral argument (trial) before the Court of Appeal of Versailles was set for March 7, 2002.  Based on this, you did not expect the Court of Appeal of Versailles to render its decision until around June 2002. You have also inquired with our appellate experts as to when they expect a ruling from the Supreme Court of France, and expect a response within the next ten (10) days from now. You will have your legal assistant translate only those portions of Mr. Cornuot's final report that differ significantly from his preliminary report.   I would also appreciate it if you would send copies of the complete report to Christophe Casabonne and Michel Bouthonnet. As soon as it becomes practical to do so, I would appreciate inquiry into how much Mr. Cornuot will request for his fees and expenses in this matter. You will also advise me of  (a) your attorney's fees and expenses outstanding, for your billed but unpaid time (if any); (b), for your accrued but unbilled time and expense; and (c), for your estimated fees and expenses going forward, until the exhaustion of all appeals. Last, you confirmed that you frequently travelled to London and expected to be available for a conference in person with Richard in either Paris or London, at his convenience, around March 12, when Richard intends to be in London on other matters. Many thanks for your help. Regards, Britt 
Call me when you have a second--713-853-5587 showard@agsk.com 01/05/2001 07:09 PM 
All parties have agreed to extend discovery cut off from 1/19 to 3/5/01, but only for depositions of scheduled persons.  The ""protected"" list includes Brian Barth, the person most knowledgable from ECT Securities, Julien Smythe, and the person most knowledgable from Akin, Gump.  The list does not include Kevin McConville.  I assume that ECT will designate Barth as PMK and that Akin Gump will designate Smythe as PMK, so that we are talking about only two depositions. Trial dates and dispositive motion deadlines have not changed. As a result of the the limited extension of discovery cutoff, plaintiffs want to push Brian back to the week of January 29th or the week of February 5th. They are also making noise about Brian's deposition possibly taking four days. We may want to take the position that Brian will be there for three days and no more.  That will ruffle a lot of feathers, and you and I should discuss it. Hennegan has asked if I will represent Akin Gump and, if so, will I accept service.  You and I should discuss this also.  Either way, we need to alert Akin Gump what is going on. ................................................

Richard, do you have these documents? Twanda Sweet Enron North America Corp. EB3821 (713) 853-9402 twanda.sweet@enron.com 
Some weeks ago, Richard sent me copies of some demand letters dated in November to the ""ENA Legal Department"" that he suspected had been laying around somewhere, and asked me to investigate.  I have had one meeting with Enron's mailroom people, who I gave my only copies of those letters.  They threw them away, thinking I had finished my investigation.  I have mentioned this to Richard and asked him to send me additional copies, but it may have slipped his mind.  Can you help me? Thanks. Britt

One of their litigators--Steve Smith-- is representing Duke International in a recently filed arbitration against ENA in which Duke seeks to cancel an LNG contract with ENA that is valued at $170 million. As you will recall, this representation was the reason that we did not meet with O'Melveny when we were in CA last month. James Derrick@ENRON 01/10/2001 05:30 PM 
Please let me have your thoughts re Adam's message.  Thank you.  Jim 
Jim - Happy New Year!  While I am no longer on the legal side of the fence, I want to pass on to you my strong recommendation for you to consider using O'Melveny & Myers, in particular for California litigation,  but perhaps in other areas.  Over the past 2 years, we used O'Melveny in connection with the wind cos dispute with Florida Power & Light, and they did a great job. O'Melveny is one of the 2 or 3 largest firms in California and probably one of its oldest and finest.  One of their litigation partners (and good personal friend of mine) is named Brian Curry, and if you have any interest in meeting these guys, they would very much like the chance to meet you. Please let me know if there might be any interest.  I hope all is well with you and your family.  Best regards. Adam 
As you will note from the attached e-mail, the Quinque class action has been remanded to state district court in Hugoton Kansas. Robin Gibbs had always predicted that this was the likely result. We will now proceed with the battle over class certification in Kansas, which,unlike Texas, is not necessarily appealable. I will keep you posted.. 
Andy is calling now, but for those of you he does reach immediately, here is a short report based on a conversation that he had with Mike Beatty. Judge Downes granted the motion to remand.  A short written order will be out later today or Monday. He apparently read from a draft of the order, and Mike Beatty says that it was written in high level generalities about presumptions in favor of remand, burden to establish removal jurisdiction, etc. and did not address the details of our federal jurisdiction (e.g., OCSLA) arguments.

There is getting to be a regular pantheon of VP's roaming the halls.  Remind me to bow and scrape the next time you're in PDX.  Or at least scrape. Seriously, great job on making VP.  You deserve it.

Dear Richard and Michelle: Attached to this e-mail is a copy of my resume and a cover letter that I have forwarded to Ms. Nedre Strambler with Enron's Human Resources department in an attempt to find a Legal Assistant position there at Enron.  As you know I was Carrin Patman's paralegal for several years over at Bracewell & Patterson and I am hoping that I might be able to use the two of you as references should I be contacted regarding the positions I've applied for. Richard, in the Beeson matter I see that the Supreme Court rendered a decision in Intratex's favor regarding the necessity of a new trial if the Plaintiffs attempt to recertify the class. As I assume you are aware, I was the person in charge of assembling and organizing all 1200 boxes of documents relating to the various Intratex, HPL, Atapco, Beeson and Mills matters and assisted Carrin and Neal Manne in many of the court appearances. I believe that this experience can be very useful if I were to work for Enron. Michelle, even though I only had an opportunity to work on a couple of your projects while you were at B&P, I did have an opportunity to assist you and others at Enron with the urgent project to produce employment records to the FTC last fall. I really enjoyed working with you and would like to do so again. Any assistance you can offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Susan M.

Just got this yesterday at 5.  I am passing it on to you and some others. As you can see, this is just an indication of level of interest, and not a commitment at this time. The prospectuses should be printed in the next week or so, and I will forward one to you.  In the mean time, let me know kind of your level of interest and I will get your name on the list.  Call or email me with any questions. Rob In conjunction with the pending IPO, Encore will be offering a Directed Share Program, also known as a ""Friends and Family Program"".  The program allows specified friends, family, and business connections to participate in Encore's offering at the time of the IPO.  The program will be facilitated through Credit Suisse First Boston. My contacts at Credit Suisse have asked that we assemble a list of those people that we wish to include in the program as soon as possible.  They will need names, addresses, and phone numbers of the proposed participants, as well as the desired number of shares, if known.  A minimum allocation of 100 shares per participant is required.  Please think of who you would like to include in the program, and send me your initial list by noon tomorrow (Thursday, January 11).  I realize that this is short notice, but not to worry; the list can be continually updated and edited as we approach the IPO date.  Please send all list revisions to me as soon as they are available. - C.DTF 
He mentioned some case he had before but I thought he told me he lost that case. He never told me that he would be filing anything. In fact, he asked me to write a letter outlining Felix's parental attributes because they were still looking at what to do. ""Elmore, Benjamin"" <belmore@velaw.com> 01/16/2001 05:03 PM 
I just spoke with Koury and he was anything but reasonable.  He has already filed an application in the Iowa courts for guardianship and conservatorhip of Alexis, even though the Iowa Code gives parental preference, which is a difficult preference to overcome.  Also, the Iowa court doesn't have jurisdiction until Texas says it does.  He said he told you about some case he took to the Iowa Supreme Court where the Court granted a grandfather possession and conservatorship over the father who was an out of state resident.

Limor and Richard, I would like to recommend that we use Goodsill, Anderson, Quinn & Stifel as our local counsel in Honolulu, the port where the M/V OBOD, and her cargo, are under arrest.  Although I do not have any personal experience with this law firm, I got their name from local admiralty attorneys who have access to the books published by the various P&I Clubs, which list what maritime attorneys each club has certified for use in each port.  The Goodsill, Anderson firm was mentioned by two different admiralty attorneys here in Houston as being listed by a number of different clubs for the port of Honolulu.  It is not at all unusual for admiralty attorneys to choose local counsel in this manner. I have not yet received Goodsill, Anderson's proposed engagement letter, but will send it to you when I do. I will call each of you tomorrow to get your thoughts on this firm. Britt 
Dear  Britt: ? Per your  request, I am forwarding you copies of our firm's resume and billing  policies.? I am also forwarding personal resumes for two of my partners,  John Lacy and Mark Desmarais, both of whom do maritime work.? For reasons  discussed hereinbelow, I suggest that Mark and his associate, Randy Baldemor,  would be best suited to work on this matter.? The billing rates for Mark  and Randy are $245/hour and?$130/hour, respectively. ? Two issues  turned up during our conflict check.? First, our firm represents Hawaiian  Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) and its subsidiaries, including its three public  utility subsidiaries, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO), Hawaii Electric  Light Company, Inc. (HELCO) and Maui Electric Company, Limited (MECO).?  Although we are not aware on any actual conflict between ENRON and HEI, HECO,  HELCO or MECO, we are cognizant that ENRON is a major player in the power  producing industry.? Accordingly, we would need to confirm that our  representation of ENRON in the present maritime matter would not preclude us  from representing HEI, HECO, HELCO or MECO in other matters in which such  companies' interests may be adverse to ENRON.? Please let me know as soon  as possible whether this arrangement is acceptable. ? Second, as it  turns out, Mark Desmarais and Randy Baldemor having been tracking the M/V OBOD  and reporting back to a Seattle Washington law firm.? The Seattle firm  retained our firm strictly to monitor the vessel and any actions with regard to  her arrest, but has neither asked for legal advice, nor disclosed who their  client is.? Mark does not believe that our firm's monitoring the status of  the vessel presents any conflicts with our representing ENRON.? He has  placed a call to the Seattle firm and expects?to hear back from his contact  later this afternoon.? Assuming our firm is engaged by ENRON, given that  they already know about the vessel, its recent history and the parties and  counsel involved, Mark and Randy would appear best suited to assist you on this  matter. ? Finally, I  passed on to Mark your immediate concern that ENRON should not be viewed  (because it missed a filing deadline or otherwise) as having abandoned its  interest in the cargo of the M/V OBOD.? Mark checked (on the premise that  our firm was being considered to be retained as Hawaii counsel) with Bryan Ho,  attorney for Nordic Technical Development, Inc., who indicated that he was not  aware of any passed or pending filing deadlines. ? I will call you  tomorrow morning, Hawaii time, to discuss the two issues that came out of our  conflict check.? I look forward to resolving these issues to our mutual  benefit and to assisting ENRON on this matter. ? Best  regards. Russell K.

Jay, As I mentioned, I had met with Richard Sanders and Andy Edison earlier today, and they recommend that we respond to Ron's latest letter.  Richard tells me that, in litigation, much is made of the fact that a party did not respond to another's correspondence.  As you can see, I have kept the response short rather than rehash and contradict once more each of Ron's numerous inaccuracies and self-serving statements.

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny for Canadian Enerdata. It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.] In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market. In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon. My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the holidays.

Can your LA office get a copy of this? 
Michael Tribolet: In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass through the power purchase costs to customers.) The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to us to make a copy for ourselves. Question to the lawyers:  Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?  Probably a good idea to have that filing passed around to this distribution list. Best,

Sounds good Britt Davis@ENRON 05/23/2000 06:03 PM 
Charlie Tetrault called me today to make sure we were aware of one more billing issue arising out of the above-referenced cases.  A little chronology may help. Until around October or November of last year, V&E's bills solely referenced the Grynberg II case.  Afterwards, due to Northern having removed the case, V&E's bills included a seperate category for Quinque time.  Starting in January of 2000, however, V&E's bills (the first one being for December time) introduced a third category for  ""Joint Defense Work"" time.  This third classification represented work done by V&E on the proposed Quinque motion to dismiss for lack of standing, etc.(but not for lack of personal jurisdiction, which briefing is being done by Fulbright).  Basically, V&E, Skadden and one other firm are putting together the draft motion to dismiss for lack of standing, etc.  Substantially all that work has already been done, according to Charlie.  The expectation was that, e.g., Enron would pay V&E's fees up front, Sonat would pay Skadden's bills up front, etc., then all those who ""fronted"" such fees would recover those payments from other members of the joint defense committee, who would be billed pro rata. What Charlie called me to say is that if we have EOG pay 50% of the Joint Defense Work time category, then the Holland & Hart trustee who eventually makes reimbursement will have to deal with an additional level of complexity in determining how the reimbursements will be made.  Charlie really left it up to us as to what we want to do; we just need to make sure that everyone (including, I guess, Holland & Hart) understands that EOG will be one of the ones ""fronting"" the money to V&E and entitled to receive reimbursement.  One the other hand, I got the impression that Charlie would appreciate it if Enron paid 100% of the Joint Defense Billing (and accordingly got 100% of any reimbursement), so that the reimbursement issue was not so complicated Frankly, I would not be surprised if Barry starts reconsidering the 50/50 split after he sees these most recent bills, given that the Jont Defense Billing is exclusively for Quinque work. My thought is not to change how we pay the 50/50 split on the bills we have already received, but advise V&E that for future bills, they can bill Enron 100% of the Joint Defense Billing category. Please let me know how you all feel about this. B.K.D. 
I am attaching a contact sheet for the attorneys who will be working on this matter.  Please feel free to call any of us at any time.  I look forward to meeting you on Monday. 
I would be shocked if HH did not have insurance for the line repairs. We should ask their atty about this. Ann Elizabeth White 05/24/2000 12:15 PM 
Candy I spoke to Steve and Gerald  about this last week.  On the monies they owed us under the gas lift contract, we gave them until May 10th to respond or we would institute litigation.  The attorney for HH, Jim Williams, called me last week and basically laid it out that HH sold all of its assets to White Oak back in December (and we already had been so informed by White Oak), that HH doesn't have any assets left and we could go after the principals if we wanted but they probably wouldn't even file an answer and we could just get a judgment and renew it every ten years for as long as we pleased.  He offered a flat settlement amount of $15,000 on our claim of $35,284.95.  Steve has given me the authority to accept the offer but after doing so will ask about settling the $11,000.00 claim for the line repairs.  Quite honestly, I don't hold out much hope of HPL recovering anything more than $15,000 but that is $15,000 more than we have right now.  Also, since Gerald was working on the gas lift debt, I've asked him to notify credit and put HH and its principals on the credit risk list so that we don't do any more deals with them.

I want to get involved in this.  Michelle will bring me up-to-date.  I don't understand why we are considering Brazilian court versus ICC arbitration. Michelle Blaine 02/01/2001 07:36 PM 
1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law. Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, Electronorte. 2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, however, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to seek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at the end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with respect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own way.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who represents them. 3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE does not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both parties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck. I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several. 4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It needs to be subject to review as we go along. 5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows. Please give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I may be unaware of with any strategic plan. Regards, Michelle

1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law. Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, Electronorte. 2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.

Why don't we file a lawsuit in state district court in Houston, serve them, and wait for their counsel to appear or take a default. We need to force them to respond. Let me know what you think. Britt Davis@ENRON 02/02/2001 10:08 AM 
Andy, This is basically a collection action for about $1,800,000 of unpaid spot gas sales against Triad, a very small company whose address (or at least one address) is in Columbus, Maryland.   The unpaid sales deals began around February of 2000.  All the deals were made over the phone by the trader, and then confirmed with ENA's spot gas sales forms (""confirms"").  Per ENA's usual custom and practice, neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms, although there are signature lines.  ENA scheduled the gas due for all of these deals.  Triad paid off some other deals, but has since stopped sending us any money.  I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February 2000.  Triad's principal, Sherwood Purnell, has apparently admitted in a recorded telephone conference that he would pay us.  Our information is that Triad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else. Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms, we have sent an arbitration demand to Triad.  Triad did not respond.  The AAA has sent out a list of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February 7.  I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and an extension for Purnell, and left a message that I want to discuss the case. This was on Monday.  I have also had  Becky, my legal assistant, call up Triad's registered agent for service of process, although the Maryland secretary of state's office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing. The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and told Becky (a) he was still the right party to receive service of process and (b) he was ""aware of us"".  This leads me to believe that the address that we have been using is a good address.  We did get someone to sign for documents that we sent to that address. What I don't want to do, however,  is go all the way through arbitration, get a default judgment, then, when we try to enforce it, have Triad complain that we sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address. My plan is to ask the AAA for a fifteen-day extension of time within which to send our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and any other address that looks viable, by Federal Express or certified mail, so that we get a receipt.  So long as we get the registered agent to sign for these things, I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding.   Giving Triad an extension of time to answer also makes us look good. Parenthetically, unfortunately, given Triad's attitude, I think it likely that after we get an arbitration award, Triad will choose not to abide by it until, at a minimum, we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the award enforced.  I don't see a way around that problem. Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time. Britt Thanks. Britt 
Ban kruptcy matters 
I just left Derrick a voicemail so I should have an answer shortly. ""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 02/02/2001 08:50 AM 
kruptcy matters Richard, Here is the status of the information we have about the City of Palo Alto's request that our firm represent them in connection with the potential bankruptcy of PG&E.  It is my understanding that the City of Palo Alto has agreed that in the event that Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse in any proceeding, then agree that our firm will have to withdraw from representation of the City of Palo Alto and that we will be able to continue to represent Enron notwithstanding the fact that they will have provided to our firm confidential information.  In particular, if Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse in connection with the California electricity litigation  (including class actions, governmental investigations and the recent decision of Enron Energy Services to transfer customers back to PG&E for physical delivery), our firm will be able to continue to represent Enron even against the City of Palo Alto. One of the reasons that the City of Palo Alto is willing to do this is that they do not believe that it is likely they will become adverse to Enron and their desire to have the specialized expertise of Larry Engel.  The City of Palo Alto has its own generation capacity through WAPA (the Western Area Power Administration), NCPA (the Northern California Power Agency), and TANC (the Transmission Authority of Northern California).  The City does buy a small amount of power from Enron, as I understand it.  We have specifically identified the City and County of San Francisco suit and asked if Palo Alto has any intention of joining that suit. Would you please let us know Enron's view of this proposed bankruptcy representation in view of these disclosures?

It seems to me that we should start the process of figuring out what ""David Noonan"" <djn@pkns.com> 01/26/2001 02:20 PM 
Gary: I received a voicemail message from Tom Lambert this morning. He advised that he had been retained by Dan Lamb for Enron as an expert but now understood that he should be talking to me and not Dan. Parenthetically, I know Tom quite well having used him on a number of cases. He wanted an update on what was happening and then stated that he had been contacted by a number of other defendants including Sempra but acknowledged that he had already been retained by Enron. I sense that he is looking for an assurance that he has a real role in this case before its too late. Tom is basically a one-man shop and this case therefore  is probably pretty significant for him in terms of a revenue source and he doesn't want to get left on the sidelines. I haven't called him back yet and want to know what I can tell him about his role or level of involvment for Enron. Please advise or give me a call if you want to discuss. Thanks.

I am reviewing a contract for testing turbines with a small municipality in Florida, under which the muni would allow us to periodically test turbines at its facilities.  They want Florida law to govern, and I don't anticipate that they will move on this.  They also want Palm Beach County as the venue for arbitration.  I am going to push for a large city to ensure a decent pool of arbitrators.  What is your view of Miami as the venue for arbitration?

If you would like to discuss, please let me know. Please confirm that the invoice has been or will be paid soon. Thanks for your help. Regards, Alan

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine. Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest. Lisa King 11/15/2000 02:19 PM 
John- Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 (October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with my thinking. Thank you, Lisa

Is this still an active case? If so, I'd like to get  a status report. Who is handling(inside and outside) Richard B Sanders 01/21/2001 10:23 AM 
Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny for Canadian Enerdata. It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.] In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market. In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon. My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the holidays. Peter.

In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.] In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market. In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon. My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the holidays. Peter. 
Do I need to get involved? Kay Mann@ENRON 01/22/2001 04:50 PM 
Yes, this is issue is still around. Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have? Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it have some greater significance? Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a sanity check. Thanks, Kay ""Thomas Hetherington"" <thetherington@bracepatt.com> on 12/19/2000 09:47:11 AM

I still don't know of any bad faith claims Michelle Blaine@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/06/2001 04:27 PM 
In the international arbitration between United India and DPC, United India seeks to have the parties realigned and force DPC to be the claimant, even though United India invoked arbitration.  We'd rather United India remain the claimant because we think they will have a difficult time carrying their burden. We are fighting this issue in the first hearing to be held before the arbitrators in London on Feb.15.  One of the bases on which United India relies, albeit weak, is that it commenced arbitration to avoid a suit in Texas courts, and that in consulting Texas lawyers, they learned ""coincidentally"" that these lawyers were ""defending 3 sets of  bad faith proceedings brought by Enron in the face of binding arbitration agreements.""   That was in November  2000.  I've called everyone I think would know, and as far as I can tell,  this is not true.  We are about to file an affidavit stating so in the case.  Please confirm (again if I have already contacted you) that you know of no bad faith claims of any kind  (not necessarily just in the insurance context) brought by Enron against anyone that is currently pending or was pending at that time.  We do not know who the lawyers they claimed to have consulted were.  Please advise me if there is someone else I should ask. Thanks for your help! Kind regards, Michelle

FYI... Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur. If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764 Regards, Darren Adamik Mgr.-Trading Technology 
Per Jeff Shankman- The attached document reflects the ENA Gas Risk Management & Middle Marketing Groups. Everyone who appears on the list has a recorded line.  I am aware that all tapes are destroyed after a certain time period; however, it is imperative that these particular tapes are never destroyed. Please archive these tapes in a secure location.

I didn't talk to them expressly but Rob told me at my review that Jim wanted him to tell me that I was ""on the line"" for the International litigation until you and Mark told him that I was ""relieved of duty.""   So I have sort of reverted back to feeling primarily responsible for it since I know you are leading the charge in California.    But whenever you and Mark are ready to relieve me I'm ready to be relieved.

I want to get involved in this.  Michelle will bring me up-to-date.  I don't understand why we are considering Brazilian court versus ICC arbitration. Michelle Blaine 02/01/2001 07:36 PM 
1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law. Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, Electronorte. 2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, however, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to seek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at the end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with respect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own way.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who represents them. 3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE does not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both parties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck. I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several. 4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It needs to be subject to review as we go along. 5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows. Please give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I may be unaware of with any strategic plan. Regards, Michelle

Richard, I echo John's desire to have all our ducks lined up to avoid the additional $4.5 million funding.  Although this amount is not huge by Enron standards, in this case any further funding has no chance of recovery and would be an immediate writeoff.  As you know, this ""project"" has had extremely high visibility.  We need to leave no stone unturned!  Thanks. Dick. John Enerson@ECT 02/14/2001 02:16 PM 
I have received notice from Can Fibre Lackawanna that there are in default under the payment obligation under the Subordinated Loan Agreement.  The Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in full, the Subordinated Lenders (thats us) can not accelerate, foreclose, etc.  There is not 180 day period.  There is nothing.  Nonetheless, this does highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to weigh our options and strategy.  This is specially true for matters with respect to the Construction Completion and the additional $4.5 million that remains unfunded.  The letter of credit backing the $4.5 million obligation expires on June 30, 2001.  At that time we have an argument that we will not replace the letter of credit and because they are in default, we are not going to fund. I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now. Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared. An analysis would include. 1.  Review of the applicable conditions to fund the $4.5 million and make sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement. In particular, since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract, we want to make certain that no rights have been waived.  Also, we want to put them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications. 2.  Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the current default. 3.  Understand our obligations.  The loan agreement requires us to fund $4.5 million upon completion (regardless of the posting of the letter of credit). By being in default, does that provide us a defense to funding.  Can they cure the default and make us fund.  What does bankruptcy do to this scenario. Let me know your thoughts and who we can talk to regarding these issues.

Attached is my first attempt to frame the applicable provisions regarding Enron's obligation to increase its Stabilization Fund letter of credit by $4.5 million on the Completion Date.  It appears that the major issues are (1) can they pass the Endurance Benchmark (24 day test) and (ii) that the estimated cost to complete the facility is in excess of amounts in the Interest Subaccount, Construction Fund, and Equity Contribution Account.  I am currently thinking that if it cost more than $4.5 million to complete the facility, senior lenders may not want to pursue completion in order to obtain our $4.5 million. 
I have received notice from Can Fibre Lackawanna that there are in default under the payment obligation under the Subordinated Loan Agreement.  The Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in full, the Subordinated Lenders (thats us) can not accelerate, foreclose, etc.  There is not 180 day period.  There is nothing.  Nonetheless, this does highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to weigh our options and strategy.  This is specially true for matters with respect to the Construction Completion and the additional $4.5 million that remains unfunded.  The letter of credit backing the $4.5 million obligation expires on June 30, 2001.  At that time we have an argument that we will not replace the letter of credit and because they are in default, we are not going to fund. I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now. Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared. An analysis would include. 1.  Review of the applicable conditions to fund the $4.5 million and make sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement. In particular, since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract, we want to make certain that no rights have been waived.  Also, we want to put them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications. 2.  Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the current default. 3.  Understand our obligations.  The loan agreement requires us to fund $4.5 million upon completion (regardless of the posting of the letter of credit). By being in default, does that provide us a defense to funding.  Can they cure the default and make us fund.  What does bankruptcy do to this scenario.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT DO NOT DISTRIBUTE Elizabeth: I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I thought I could generally review the PPA in any event. In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D. As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position. Preliminary Overall Assessment The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue. While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for ""Year 1"" only would apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for ""Year 35"" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract Term.

Sandy- I just received the billing summary of power purchased from Michigan Power Limited Partnership for January 2001.  As expected, they have used the capacity charges corresponding to Year 6 (On Peak = $41.99/MWh, Off Peak = $39.89).  Could you please draft a quick letter as suggested by Marcus Nettelton.  The correct capacity charges should be On Peak  = $45.90/MWh, Off Peak = $43.60/MWh. Rick, I will fax you a copy of the billing summary and then you can forward it others in your shop. Thanks, Ketan Marcus.Nettelton@enron.com on 02/15/2001 11:48:19 AM 
Further to the email sent yesterday by Eddy Daniels, we believe that if Consumers Energy fail to adjust the amount of capacity charges in January 2001, which it appears that they are likely to do following their letter of February 5, 2001, we are of the view that a notice of disagreement should be sent to Consumers Energy. In principle we suggest that the notice should dispute that the correct capacity charge has been applied, stating the correct capacity charge and requesting that Consumers Energy re-submit their invoice to reflect the correct capacity charge. Please do not hesitate to call me on 713 345 8161 to discuss this further. Kind regards. Marcus Nettelton Senior Counsel

transmission FYI - In case you haven't seen this. 
fyi per earlier e-mail.  thanks, ron. 
Hopefully this provides what you are looking for, however, there is more to come. Please note the fourth paragraph requesting the total labor and expenses for the ""big picture"".  This was discussed at our first meeting and hopefully, you can produce same or make it available to him for inspection. Also, we need to quickly resolve the ""missing System 700 book"".  If it exists, lets produce it.  If not, we need to advise that it was miscommunication or whatever, but we need to do so soon. I thought we were going to advise that we had appointed a ""point"" person to deal with extracting information from the subcontractors.  Apparently this was not communicated to Claude.  Do you want to re-consider allowing him to go direct? 
Jim/Russ/Ron, This will confirm our tele-conference this AM on the pending claim filed on behalf of Doyle. Unfortunately, my meeting at Dean-Oliver did not fully take place on the intended scope as Charlie McCorkle had to take his wife to the doctor on an unexpected trip.  I am out of town until Friday, but we do plan on meeting Friday afternoon, I will respond on any additional information outstanding. (Charlie had Kelly McKenzie's book with him) You had ask that I further explain our deductions on the reduced Craft Labor hours detailed in my last letter.  In our December meeting it was noted that NEPCO was in a support roll to Elliott on the rebuild.  NEPCO had their most involvement at the very beginning and very end of the repairs.  The repair area had its own trailers, parts warehouse and staging area.  We discussed in the meeting that the support roll essentially would take a Supervisor and three employees per shift or about eight per 24 day.  In review of the submitted labor it is noted that an average of three Start-up Employees charged their full day to this job from 6/15 up to 7/3, then 4 up to 7/17, then 6+ up to the final completion of repairs, 7/23.  At the same time, Office Staff employees averaged charging up to 8 employees per day, day shift, during the repair time and continued to charge labor up to a month after.  The Craft Labor group charged an average of 11 employees per day charging all of their work day to the repairs.  When you average it out, you had around 13 support personnel for an Elliott crew on every shift (24 hours), when the Elliott crew consisted of about 13 to 15 persons.  This would account for between 25 to 30 people (without consultants & sub-contractors) time charged working every hour, 24 hours the entire time. Add the consultants/subcontractors and it goes up to a minimum of 30 people. This is unrealistic by any standard and cannot be explained away as an inefficiency of site versus shop work. One of our requests in our meeting in Houston was that additional information concerning the total labor and expenses charged to the entire site be made available to see the ""big picture"" of the site labor and expense charges on a weekly or monthly basis.  This additional information or it's location has not been forthcoming to date.  There has to be some type of summary cost details which Doyle was billed on a per Unit basis. I also noted that I would comment on differences in scope of repair, thus a lesser measurement of the loss & payable claim.   I have been commenting on differences in scope since my first letter and subsequently as information has been made available.  The major scope differences are: 1. Partial vs. full stationary and rotor blades 2. Repaired versus replaced 1st Stage Turbine Buckets & Nozzles 3. Use of ""old"" designed stub shaft vs. purchase of ""new"" designed stub shaft 4. Overscope of repairs by Preco on work completed in their shop. 5. Elliott overscope of repairs associated with some of the above items, misalignment and other items noted in my e-mail of 1/24 (including work completed on Units #2 & #3). 6. NEPCO labor charges noted above. There are a number of lessor items.  If the meeting this Friday takes place, I will respond as fully as possible to the claim next week based on documentation we have received to date.  It is unfortunate that there was no ""System 700"" or similar type book completed on the repairs.  Our discussions in Houston and up until recently indicated that this was an SOP at NEPCO. As I noted the Kelly McKenzie book is not a complete view of the repairs made. The request to directly contact sub-contractors to discuss their scope of work in my last letter has not been responded to. Once again, I will e-mail you after our meeting Friday with any requested support items that were to be included in this e-mail. Claude 
#01912X-00-28-01 
#01912X-00-28-01 fyi per e-mail.  thanks, ron. 
Richard, I have attached an e-mail forwarded to Claude Chandler (FM Global) in response to an earlier e-mail from him and another e-mail received last Friday stating their new position.  I will also send to you the e-mails from Claude I mentioned in the preceeding sentence. I will follow this with a phone call to you this morning so I can bring you up to speed on the activity associated with this insurance claim.  One item that needs your immediate attention is a provision in the Insurance Policy that could hamper our ability to litigate if this becomes our only viable alternative to resolve the differences.  There is a deadline for litigation tied to the date of the initial failure (one year which would make it June 15, 2001).  It also requires that prior to litigation, the parties need to first resolve through dispute resolution/arbitration.  It has been my experience that arbitration normally takes 90-120 days.  There is only one defined action with days attached to it in the policy (60 days to establish reps for each party).  I think you see the dilemna. I look forward to our discussion. Thanks, Ron. 
Claude, In regard to your e-mail dated February 7th, we will be sending to you (tomorrow for overnight delivery) documentation in support of our claim and responses to address other open issues as stated in your e-mail.  The information will address the following: Previous detail and summaries of the original insurance claim amount of $6,452,318.02 New detail and summaries for Enron's current position, including -- detailed labor breakdowns for services provided by Elliott and NEPCO.  This will identify labor hours and charges by: day, craft, individual, rate classification if applicable (i.e., straight time, over time and double time), etc. Support for overhead charges applicable to NEPCO's billing Support for other charges associated with Unit I claim not previously identified (i.e., insurance for the repair period for Unit I) Detail and summaries of other NEPCO services provided but not associated with Unit I repair/claim Letters or documentation in support of major scope differences Note: The detail related to the NEPCO charges will follow (by end of this week). In addition, I spoke with Grady James, the Doyle Facility Plant Manager, and he indicated that the ""System 700"" documentation prepared by NEPCO was made available to you at the site.  This documentation was provided along with the Unit 1-3 refurbishment documentation.  Fortunately, this information continues to be maintained at the site and is available for your review (at the site) if you wish.  In regard to other documentation or notes, the information forwarded by Russ Porter in early February should have satisfied all previous requests.  If there is a specific request beyond what we have already forwarded, we will respond accordingly. You also indicated in your e-mail a desire to directly contact sub-contractors to discuss their scope of work.  As a result of confidentiality provisions within the service agreements, I would request that you indicate to me who you would like to contact and we will provide the necessary waivers to those parties. Last, we just received your e-mail (dated Friday, Feb. 23) related to FM Global's current position.  Obviously we are disappointed that the two parties are this far apart.  Can I assume that this position reflects everything you characterized as outstanding in your e-mail (i.e., awaiting signoff from Charlie McCorckle and others)?  I assume we will have questions as we continue to review the material.  Should we forward those to you? Please call me if you have any questions or comments on 713-853-9298. Thanks, Ron.

Jim, we have a former employee who tried to exercise options which had expired on the 31st day after employment termination, as the 30th day provided for in the grant agreement was a Sunday.  Paine Webber refused and she then asked us to honour the obligation in any event or to change her employment termination date.  In consultation with Enron Corp. (Mary Joyce and Michael Fauerbacher) the request was denied.  She has now sued both Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. in the Alberta courts.  The amount is not large ($US27,000) but he principle and precedent value is.  I think our position is very strong but there are some issues around the calculation of days from termination and performance required on non-business days (which is not provided for in the grant agreements).  I have a call with Mary Joyce and Michael Fauerbacher of Enron Corp. tomorrow and was going to involve litigation counsel - Dalton McGrath - a partner at Blake Cassels and Graydon who is in my estimation very effective and aggressive.  Is this OK with you and/or do we need to involve outside counsel in Houston to monitor Enron Corp.'s interests? Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks and regards, Peter.

Gas Company Richard, In connection with the sale of Houston Pipe Line Company, we are transferring ownership in the above-referenced companies from HPL to an entity now named LOA, Inc. which, until closing of the HPL sale, is a wholly owned sub of HPL. At, or just prior to closing, that ownership will be transferred to Enron Corp. since these companies are excluded assets. There is a note in the Corp. Secretary's records that indicates no mergers or consolidations of assets of these entities should take palce without Bob Williams approval. I am assuming that now means you and I do not believe the transfer of the stock qualifies as either a merger or a consolidation. However, since I believe the issue centers around pending or threatened litigation I thought I would pass this along in the event you needed to know or had an issue with it. Please let me know ASAP if you do--I am making the conveyance effective February 28th Thanks,

I am scheduled to be in London next week.  I would like to sit down and talk to you about this. T Paul Johnson@ENRON 02/20/2001 03:08 AM 
Paul Simons suggested I wrote to you to inform you that I am presently handling a number of small arbitration/claims matters on behalf of Enron Metals, which are subject to English law and London arbitration (LME).  They are generally for quite small amounts (presently from US$ 68,000 to US$ approx. 400,000).  I would be grateful if you could let me know the extent to which you wish to be involved or to monitor these. Paul Johnson

Sandy- I just received the billing summary of power purchased from Michigan Power Limited Partnership for January 2001.  As expected, they have used the capacity charges corresponding to Year 6 (On Peak = $41.99/MWh, Off Peak = $39.89).  Could you please draft a quick letter as suggested by Marcus Nettelton.  The correct capacity charges should be On Peak  = $45.90/MWh, Off Peak = $43.60/MWh. Rick, I will fax you a copy of the billing summary and then you can forward it others in your shop. Thanks, Ketan Marcus.Nettelton@enron.com on 02/15/2001 11:48:19 AM 
Further to the email sent yesterday by Eddy Daniels, we believe that if Consumers Energy fail to adjust the amount of capacity charges in January 2001, which it appears that they are likely to do following their letter of February 5, 2001, we are of the view that a notice of disagreement should be sent to Consumers Energy. In principle we suggest that the notice should dispute that the correct capacity charge has been applied, stating the correct capacity charge and requesting that Consumers Energy re-submit their invoice to reflect the correct capacity charge. Please do not hesitate to call me on 713 345 8161 to discuss this further. Kind regards. Marcus Nettelton Senior Counsel

Tim, Here is the email you should send out with respect to retention of hard copies of documents. IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must handle those hard copy documents: 1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact _____ who can arrange for storage. 2. What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes, charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall. 3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation. 4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy and you may do with them as you wish. Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me. Thanks Gary ======================================================= This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

What is the status of this? I agree with your analysis. However,If the core performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the CTS bond in no longer operable because of Davis' actions, then why is the PX holding on to our collateral? Is that question now before FERC? What happens if we lose at FERC---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here? I would like your and Gary's thoughts. ""Harry Olivar"" <hao@quinnemanuel.com> 02/16/2001 08:38 PM 
We should discuss Tuesday what our current goal is in the AAA arbitration we filed.  (An administrative conference call is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21, at noon PST.) From our perspective, it would make sense to put the arbitration on hold pending FERC's ruling on the charge-backs.  (Based on a conversation with counsel this afternoon, the PX is perfectly willing to do this.)  If FERC ultimately rules against us, the PX would be able to assert a set-off that would wipe out the claim in the arbitration.  If FERC disapproves the charge-backs, it may be possible to resolve the excess collateral issue. Let's discuss on Tuesday whether you agree, or whether there are reasons for active pursuit of the arbitration. 
There is a conference call on Monday that I have asked the Quinn Emanuel folks to participate in.If anyone else wants to participate, contact Bill Urquhart. I am out on Spring Break but can be reached at 713-410-6128 or 817-922-0998 Steve C Hall 03/08/2001 08:11 PM 
Earlier this week, PG&E paid $177 million to the ISO.  The ISO has not distributed that money to creditors because of the Enron v. CalPX suit.  As documented in an earlier e-mail, Chris Stokley, Murray O'Neill, and I called the ISO's treasurer and explained that the judge's order expressly excluded payments to the CAISO from the PX's general right not to pay creditors. The ISO now informs us that the CalPX plans to have PG&E's payment transferred to the PX into an escrow account.  I copied the key part of the ISO's document below, and the full document is attached. ""Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied in payment of California Power Exchange (""Cal PX"") obligations.  The ISO has been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action in federal court entitled ""Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v. California Power Exchange Corporation"", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central District of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a segregated interest

Per your request. 
To All California Power Exchange Participants: Notice is hereby provided pursuant to Section 19.3.4 of the California Power Exchange Tariff that the Consumer Services Division of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), as part of its investigation into the ""generating, selling, buying and trading of energy in the State of California"" (see attached declaration of Barbara Ferguson), has requested information that may be confidential under Section 19.3.2 of the CalPX Tariff.  The subpoena requests the California Power Exchange to respond to the subpoena no later than Thursday, February 15, 2001, but Ms. Ferguson has agreed to extend the deadline until Tuesday, February 20, 2001.  If you desire to assert a claim of privilege or confidentiality pursuant to legal authority, the California Power Exchange will include your written assertion of that claim, together with its submittal to the CPUC, provided that it is timely received.  The CPUC has indicated that for purposes of this investigation, it is willing to treat confidential information in a manner comparable to that provided under Section 583 of the Public Utilities Code for confidential information provided by public utilities to the CPUC.  Your written statement must be directed to the CPUC as follows: Barbara J.

Another subpoena. 
To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: The ISO received a subpoena today from the California Attorney General.  The subpoena requires a response March 23. The subpoena and the cover letter are attached.  The cover letter indicates that the Attorney General agrees to abide by the confidentiality provisions outlined in an October 25, 2000 letter from the Attorney General which is also attached.  The CA ISO will mark as confidential documents it produces to the Attorney General that contain information subject to 20.3.2, and will request confidential treatment in accordance with the AG's October 25 letter. Concerns related to the subpoena should be relayed directly to the Attorney General. The AG contact related to the subpoena is Richard Rochman who can be reached at (415) 703-1404.   The ISO would appreciate being notified also of any concerns.  The ISO contacts are Jeanne Sol, at jsole@caiso.com <mailto:jsole@caiso.com>  and Norma Formanek at  <mailto:nformanek@fbm.com> nformanek@fbm.com both of whom should be copied on correspondence. - March7letter.pdf - March8sub.pdf - 10-25caisoconfidential1025.doc

This is the asbestos case in which HPL was recently added as a defendant.  I spoke with Scott Wert, the plaintiff's counsel today.  HPL was sued as to only one plaintiff, Larry Don Williams.  I called to get info on why HPL was sued and alleged dates of exposure.  Wert advised me that HPL was added as a plaintiff because Larry Don Williams was allegedly exposed to asbestos while working for Thomas Construction Company at an HPL facility in Berkclair, Texas, during 1963 and 1964.  He also told me that Williams was allegedly exposed at a Houston Natural Gas Pipeline facility in Victoria, Texas, during 1970-72.  (We have not yet been served as to Houston Natural Gas Pipeline.) Wert did not have information in his database as to Williams' employer during that time period. Rob, as we have previously discussed, I assume that you will check to determine what policies of insurance might cover claims for those time periods. Our answer date on this matter is next Monday, March 26, but plaintiffs' counsel has said that we can have a couple of extra weeks if we would like. I will send him a Rule 11 agreement to secure the extra time, so that we can

Yes---Dave Weiner at Hahn Loeser, 216-241-2824. I am not  sure I want to coordinate that much, at least yet. Key Corp refused to wave conflict for several other firms and I still think I might be able to talk my way out of it.

Personal and Confidential Privileged Solicitor and Client Communication As many of you know, I met with Chris Calger yesterday in Portland.  I will be preparing a memorandum of my conversation with Chris which I will ask him to review for distribution.  In summary, Chris was frank and open, and in my view, expressed genuine corporate concern with the investigation.  I believe that my notes will indicate that Chris did not have direct contact with PowerX in connection with any particular trade during the period being investigated by the government.  Although, in my view, Chris had general knowledge of Enron*s approach taken in connection with bidding power into the pool, he did not see himself as spearheading or orchestrating that process.  I hope to prepare my memo today for review by Chris later in the day. PowerX has retained the law firm of Lawson Lundell in Vancouver to represent their interest.  The lawyer is Chris Sanderson who is a senior member of the B.C. and Alberta Bars.  His practice focuses on regulatory law and civil litigation, particularly in the energy industry. I spoke to Chris Sanderson today to introduce myself and to give him a very general background on the investigation conducted at the Calgary office.  He reported that a similar investigation had taken place in the PowerX office in Vancouver.  Their investigation started at the same time as ours and ended on Thursday of last week. Chris Sanderson did confirm that there are tapes of conversations with Enron involving these various trades.  As a result, I suspect that these tapes ought to contain the same dialogue that is contained on our tapes. I did not get into any discussion as to the information that may be contained on the tapes and exactly what information had been seized by the government.  I did get the impression, however, that the government has taken possession of tapes from PowerX. He indicated that in his preliminary view the documents themselves are not the concern but the tapes are.  Again, I did not discuss any particular matter with respect to the tapes only that Enron did keep taped conversations of trades undertaken by its traders. I think it would be worthwhile, and he agreed, if Glenn Leslie and I, and perhaps Web, met with Chris at the appropriate time.  He is open to entertain a dialogue between counsel subject of course to matters of privilege and commonality of interest. He indicated that he wants to take approximately two weeks to review the evidence obtained by the investigators (he has not done so yet and preferred having a firm knowledge of the information seized by the government before talking to us) and thereafter, initiate a dialogue with us to see what information might be worth sharing. I will have Glenn Leslie give him a call to try to set a date when we might meet with him.  We might want to discuss briefly during our telephone conference on Friday our approach to meeting with Lawson Lundell and what would be our ultimate objectives in doing so. Yesterday, I talked to Cliff O*Brien, the counsel retained for John Lavorato, and tried to give him a very brief overview of the issues. Unfortunately, I was at the Portland airport when I did talk to him and had to keep my conversation somewhat cryptic.  Cliff did meet with John Lavorato for approximately two hours last night.  Cliff called me this morning and would like to meet with me.  I will meet him at 4:00 today. Cliff indicated that the matter was more complex than he had imagined and expressed a view that in John*s opinion these were simple trades and nothing else.  I will report to you further on this after I have had a chance to meet with Cliff O*Brien. If any of you have any questions, please don*t hesitate to call.  In any event, we will be talking at our regularly scheduled conference call Friday at 10:30 (central time). Regards, Dan

Christian, EPMI owes the PX a payment of approximately $25k this Friday for real-time charges for December.  It's the true-up payment (volume management calls it the ""final"" invoice). Query:  Should we advise the PX to take the payment out of EPMI's collateral, like we did last time?  I told Brett ""yes,"" subject to check with you. Brett will wait to hear from you or me before he advises Houston. Thanks, Steve

FYI 
I just accepted approx. $250,000.00 settlement from the insurance company to cover part of our losses and expenses from the Styrene contamination.  I have been assured by the insurance company that this settlement will not hamper Enron in going after Baytank for additional funds. Once I receive the paperwork on the settlement I will forward it on to Richard Sanders here at Enron.  The Insurance company has recommended a joint lawsuit to try and collect the remaining lost funds.  The insurance company will go after Baytank for the $250,000.00 as soon as possible. We will still have roughly $500,000.00 on the books from last year.

We have no plans for the weekend of the 20th. Why not bring them all. We can get babysitters to help if we go out(which I am sure we will) As for the Perd, we are definitely coming.

With Maury's work schedule, I bet that he will be unable to make the dinner, so I need to decide if I am going to or not. ?But, we would like to come for the wedding. ?That is either asking you to help us with the kids...all of them, or ... helping us find enough sitters for them if you have plans. ? Steve has offered to keep Carolyn, and if we come just the night, I might do that. ??It is just a hard decision to make. ?She is still so young. Anyway, please see if this conflicts with anything. ?The other option would be to stay at John and Yvonne's....or leave the boys there...and Maury and I stay with Carolyn at the Houstonian. ?We do not want to impose....and I know that I am asking alot. Easter sounds good to us. ?There was a chance that Maury's sister was coming...but they just found out they owe alot in Taxes....so cancelled. ?We will probably go on down on Thursday night since we are off on Good Friday. ? There is a big event in San Antonio that I plan to take the kids to. ?I think it will be at 1:00...so we will plan to be gone on that day. ?Which will give some breathing room for whoever is there. ?There is this huge egg hunt at the Episcopal Diosese...which is where Maury's mom works...and I hear it is better than any country club egg hunt. ?Just fun. ?So we will go there and come back for the night. When it gets closer we can coordinate some meals. ?I would be happy to grocery shop for everyone.....and split it down there. ?What do you feel like having. Anyway, I will talk with you later.

My check is on the way. ""Max"" <fme@egglestonbriscoe.com> 03/24/2001 10:57 AM 
I received an invoice this week from the Rockets for playoff tickets. We need to make payment for the first two rounds by March 30 and decide whether any credit should be refunded or applied to next year's tickets. The cost for the first two rounds (which assumes 6 games) is $2,944. This calculation is based on $944 for Round 1 (2 games with no home court advantage) and $2000 for Round 2 (4 games assuming home court advantage). Based upon the existing split, I need to collect the following amounts from each of you by March 30: Gage (25%): $736 Roten (25%): $736 Ballard (12.5%): $368 Doherty (12.5%): $368 Sanders (12.5%): $368 Eggleston (12.5%): $368 I suggest that any credit for unplayed games be applied to next year's tickets. If anyone does not want playoff tickets or wants to opt out of next year's tickets, let me know as soon as possible so I can make other arrangements. Anyone not buying playoff tickets for the first two rounds will not be entitled to buy tickets for Rounds 3 and 4 in the unlikely event that the Rockets survive. By the way, tickets for Rounds 3 and 4 will cost $4,976! Call me at 713/659-5100 with any questions. Max

Can we talk about this when you have a second? Bonnie White/ENRON@enronXgate 03/22/2001 06:28 PM 
I spoke with Jim Studdert re this matter, and he advised that he believes that it may be covered at least in part by our insurance program.  He is forwarding it to our insurers for their review.  (I understand that he's never gotten a definitive answer re coverage in the other NSM matters, so that may end up being the case here.)  I will let you know when I hear anything further re a coverage determination. Bonnie J.

Did we ever destroy these tapes? Also-- I am assuming that NGX is well covered and that you don't need any help. If not, please let me know. Perhaps I can get info from Mark Powell--by 
Have you met Mark Powell from Canada?  You should make a serious effort to get to know him since you are Mr Canada. He is here for 3-4 weeks more

Project Stanley tapes were destroyed. NGX is covered - we continue to negotiate a commercial solution which will see EOL data included in the index - had a meeting Friday and we are getting closer. The shaved head is Powell's deal - can you believe a guy shaving his head just to suck up for a promotion? Peter.

What gives?

A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap. 1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile (""Codelco"" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG and MGCC This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG. Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made subject to prior approval by legal. Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, High Court proceedings take place in public. - LT010810084_3.doc 2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. Solicitors: Clyde & Co. 3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally (and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy. 4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter) Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3). NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared. 5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH (and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3. 
The draft Response looks good. ""Howard J. Weg"" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 03/26/2001 12:16 PM 
Attached is a draft Response on behalf of the Committee to the Debtor's Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay.  As I do not yet have the US Trustee's notice of appointment or a contact list, I did not have the complete names of each of the members.  Please email those to me along with your comments. I would like to send the Response to Judge Smith this afternoon, if possible, which means that it needs to be completed by 1:30.  Please forward your comments by that time.  Sorry for the short fuse. In addition, please send me your suggestions for counsel and for the agenda items for the meeting on March 28, which will follow the hearing that starts at 930 am. *CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE* The information contained in this e-mail message is intended only for the personal and confidential use of the recipient(s) named above.

Milberg Weiss is the main plaintiffs' counsel. They are a well known (and good) securities class action plaintiffs firm. The John O'Quinn of LA---Tom Girardi-- is the plaintiffs' atty in the somewhat related gas cases. These are not PI types per se, but more commercial litigation plaintiffs firms.

Richard: What is the makeup of the plaintiffs' bar in all the litigation in Calif?  Is it attracting PI types? Jordan 
We argued the issue of additional document production this afternoon. Morris took it under advisement. The One Oak issue came up.  Morris said he had not realized it involved an Enron entity.  He will stay away from it.  I assured him it was no problem. He also disclosed that he had presented some award to Ken Lay recently at an industry conference.  Smith assured him that was no problem either. Neal S. Manne (713) 653-7827 nmanne@susmangodfrey.com 
Sounds great. If you are going there from your office I might want to catch a ride. If not, I got the directions and will see you there. ""A William Urquhart"" <awu@quinnemanuel.com> 03/26/2001 01:10 PM
