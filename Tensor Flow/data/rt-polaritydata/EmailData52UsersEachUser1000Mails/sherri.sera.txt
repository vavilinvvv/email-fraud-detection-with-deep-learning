Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee. I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any questions you may have. To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged. Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804. I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for spending your time on this critical process.

After having lived through another PRC process, it has become exceedingly obvious that there are several issues that need improvement in the process. With all our discussions about Communication within Enron, I am now communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to other parties without change. 1)  Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period, not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such review period.  This is only fair to our employees so that they know the criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance. 2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without a bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works within the system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and it still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to be an unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upward feedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide input to my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I have worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from this process?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner. How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate? 3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the process.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute minimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the job function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to provide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual that partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was not even asked for input. 4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our PRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HR representatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.  Neither one of the definitions describes such performance as ""simply doing the job"". Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not effectively and precisely rate the employee.  What we end up with in the PRC is an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to pull the entire group back a notch.  With better definitions and communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be lacking. Thanks for your listening ear.

Thanks for the quick response, Joe.  Peter did call me earlier this afternoon, and I transferred him to Dave Delainey.  Unfortunately, I failed to get his phone number before transferring him, but I understand from Dave's assistant that he left Dave a voicemail.  I'm sure he left his number there. I did, however, gleen from him that he and his investors already own the 50 buildings (not in the process of buying them as I originally thought) and have +/- 100 additional properties they manage. I'm stepping out of the middle of this one now unless there is anything further you need me to do.  Good luck - I hope it's a real deal - I've never had origination next to my name before!

Sherri, We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence. Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us. Joe Joseph P.

Thanks for the quick response, Joe.  Peter did call me earlier this afternoon, and I transferred him to Dave Delainey.  Unfortunately, I failed to get his phone number before transferring him, but I understand from Dave's assistant that he left Dave a voicemail.  I'm sure he left his number there. I did, however, gleen from him that he and his investors already own the 50 buildings (not in the process of buying them as I originally thought) and have +/- 100 additional properties they manage. I'm stepping out of the middle of this one now unless there is anything further you need me to do.  Good luck - I hope it's a real deal - I've never had origination next to my name before!

Sherri, We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence. Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us. Joe Joseph P.

I spoke to his father last night at a dinner party; Peter is putting together a deal in Tokyo right now to purchase 50 office buildings and manage another 100.

Just wanted to give you a heads up in the hopes you will take a few minutes to talk to him. SRS

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS. Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge to this very worthy cause 1-1. I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your consideration.

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend that you speak at this conference.

Sherri, I can pledge $2 per mile. Vince Enron North America Corp. 
Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS. Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge to this very worthy cause 1-1. I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your consideration.

Jeff, Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to have you as a keynote speaker. Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn a few times about the program and  I think that this will be an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and agenda for the future. I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation. Vince 
I think he can do it, Vince, but UT has asked him to speak at a Leadership conference also on 2/16, which Rick Causey is encouraging him to do.  He has all the information (I just sent it home in his mail as he returned this afternoon from a week of travel), so will press him to make a decision tomorrow.  He may decide to do both or one or the other...I'll let you know as soon as I do.  SRS Vince J Kaminski@ECT 10/12/2000 04:57 PM

Steve, I had some time this afternoon, so I have called the executive assistants myself.  Most have some sort of org charts (see ENA below), but many have only business unit ""executive committee"" charts and do not go further in the organization.  I'll forward to you what I've received (several e-mails will follow).  Once you've had a chance to look at them, let me know what you think.  SRS

Dear Ms. Siska, On behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling, I am responding to a request from Mr. Warren Staley to forward to you the name of Enron's contact with regard to an information exchange on leadership development between Enron and Cargill. Mr. Skilling suggests that you call Mr. Steve Kean, EVP and Chief of Staff. Mr. Kean can be reached at 713.853.1586 or via e-mail at steven.kean@enron.com. If I may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax)

Hi Sherri, Beth asked me to see if you might help us with locating space on the 50th floor from January 2nd - January 25th. As we did last January, we would like to setup editing equipment at the Enron building for putting together the Analyst Meeting tapes. I know that the office we used in January is now occupied, but Beth wondered if either Joe Suttons former office or Rob Wahl's old office might be available.  Locating the editing equipment in the building makes it easier for those Enron folks involved in the process to stay close to the process. If you are able to help us with this, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Richard Yeats 
Steve and Mark, a good friend of mine works for Mr. Grimes at Stewart & Stevenson.  They have been offered this opportunity by the China Assoc. for Social and Economic Development for a commitment of $74,000.  Since Mr. Lay has been a past recipient (according to their attached letter), they are wondering if this is legit.  Can you provide any insight?  Thanks for your help.  SRS 
I had originally declined this invitation, but decided to run it by you after closer review.  He could be there if he chooses to and if you think he should.  Please advise.  SRS

Sherry, thanks for your guidance concerning the possibility of an Enron participant for the VMA's Seminar on Electric Utility Restructuring scheduled for June 19, 2001.  I serve as Chairman of the VMA's Energy Resources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and the day-long agenda it will entail. As I explained, depending upon the availability of Mr. Skilling or another key individual, the VMA  is offering Enron an opportunity to participate in its seminar in an important way.  We seek to have Enron speak on the subject of the developing competitive market and how that market may be accessible and beneficial to VMA's member manufacturers which include many, if not most, of the large companies residing in Virginia.  The purpose of the seminar is entirely educational, as customers in Virginia will be able, under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passed in 1999, to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 1, 2002, and by no later than January 1, 2003.  The subject is becoming a high priority for VMA members, given the prominence of energy issues today generally, and the imminence of the date when choice will be available to Virginia customers. We envision that Enron's message could be encouraging for VMA members who today hear much about the dilemma in California (another seminar participant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives in California and other states) and understandably wonder about the prospects for successful competition and effective choice in Virginia.  Enron could hopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers once the day of choice arrives, touching on Enron's online trading platform, aggregation possibilities (an alternative which the VMA, as an umbrella organization, is considering), and related topics. The seminar will begin at 8:30am and conclude at 4:30pm, with the possible Enron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1:00pm.  We expect good attendance on the part of VMA members, and plan to offer attendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel, legislators and others who have been closely involved  with the development of the Virginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years or so. I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, and again thank you for your assistance.  I will be happy to discuss the particulars with you or anyone else, should that be helpful, and can be reached at AEP's state office in Richmond at 804-698-5511.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve= ral=20 months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.= =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues. What happened in California The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state. In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price. Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt. In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices. At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis. Enron=01,s Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts: ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility. You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018= of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts: ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times. Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services. The Solution The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary= , the=20 state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark= et=20 and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities. Increasing Supply California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing= =20 short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les= s=20 than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl= y=20 must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20 generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the= =20 regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20 displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can= =20 have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20 facilities. Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. = =20 They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail= =20 market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman= d=20 at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market= . Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20 volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer= =20 term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han= ds=20 of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market= . =20 Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the= ir=20 price risk. Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20 greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to= =20 arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov= er=20 their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and= =20 distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is= =20 needed. Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that= ,=20 while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters= =20 worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work= ed;=20 and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages= ,=20 which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20 ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether = it=20 is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall= ey=20 or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20 shortage worse. The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20 California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that= =20 the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20 constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in= =20 California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20 generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road= s=20 and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do. As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t= he=20 crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron= will=20 continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20 solutions to the state. =20

Touche' The Wisdom of Will Rogers Don't squat with your spurs on. Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment. Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in. If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to make sure it's still there. If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' somebody else's dog  around. After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut. Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day. There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works. If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'. Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco. It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep. Always drink upstream from the  herd. When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be surprised if they learn their lesson. When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around by somebody else. The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in your  pocket. Never miss a good chance to shut up. There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for  themselves.

Lockyer writes a very belated letter to the LA Times---""regret"" of the slimy variety: My comment about introducing an energy company executive to the ugly reality of a prison cell was repeated recently by columnist Peter King (June 10) and has become fodder for commentaries that suggest I might think that prison rape is proper punishment for criminals. My anger over the activities of energy barons doesn't come close to my lifelong outrage at the crime of rape. As attorney general I significantly reordered my department's priorities in order to complete the DNA offender database this year. I also sponsored new laws to help fight rape crimes. My office prosecuted prison guards charged with encouraging inmate rapes at Corcoran State Prison. I guess I let my anger get the better of me in talking about the mercenary corporate executives who are making life so miserable for millions of Californians. I should have made my point--that even the most powerful corporate executives are not beyond the law--without the crude remark. Bill Lockyer Attorney General Sacramento 
Steve, given yesterday's conversation toward the end of the executive committee - i.e., countries ENE will do business in - do you think we should try to set up another policy committee meeting?

I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price. Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt. In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices. At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis. Enron=01,s Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts: ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility. You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018= of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts: ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times. Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services. The Solution The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary= , the=20 state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark= et=20 and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities. Increasing Supply California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing= =20 short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les= s=20 than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl= y=20 must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20 generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the= =20 regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20 displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can= =20 have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20 facilities. Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. = =20 They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail= =20 market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman= d=20 at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market= . Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20 volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer= =20 term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han= ds=20 of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market= . =20 Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the= ir=20 price risk. Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20 greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to= =20 arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov= er=20 their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and= =20 distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is= =20 needed. Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that= ,=20 while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters= =20 worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work= ed;=20 and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages= ,=20 which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20 ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether = it=20 is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall= ey=20 or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20 shortage worse. The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20 California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that= =20 the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20 constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in= =20 California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20 generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road= s=20 and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do. As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t= he=20 crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron= will=20 continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20 solutions to the state. =20

Hi Sherri, Beth asked me to see if you might help us with locating space on the 50th floor from January 2nd - January 25th. As we did last January, we would like to setup editing equipment at the Enron building for putting together the Analyst Meeting tapes. I know that the office we used in January is now occupied, but Beth wondered if either Joe Suttons former office or Rob Wahl's old office might be available.  Locating the editing equipment in the building makes it easier for those Enron folks involved in the process to stay close to the process. If you are able to help us with this, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Richard Yeats

Lockyer writes a very belated letter to the LA Times---""regret"" of the slimy variety: My comment about introducing an energy company executive to the ugly reality of a prison cell was repeated recently by columnist Peter King (June 10) and has become fodder for commentaries that suggest I might think that prison rape is proper punishment for criminals.

As attorney general I significantly reordered my department's priorities in order to complete the DNA offender database this year. I also sponsored new laws to help fight rape crimes.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve= ral=20 months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.= =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues. What happened in California The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state. In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price. Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt. In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices. At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis. Enron=01,s Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts: ?

Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.

Sherry, thanks for your guidance concerning the possibility of an Enron participant for the VMA's Seminar on Electric Utility Restructuring scheduled for June 19, 2001.  I serve as Chairman of the VMA's Energy Resources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and the day-long agenda it will entail. As I explained, depending upon the availability of Mr. Skilling or another key individual, the VMA  is offering Enron an opportunity to participate in its seminar in an important way.  We seek to have Enron speak on the subject of the developing competitive market and how that market may be accessible and beneficial to VMA's member manufacturers which include many, if not most, of the large companies residing in Virginia.  The purpose of the seminar is entirely educational, as customers in Virginia will be able, under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passed in 1999, to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 1, 2002, and by no later than January 1, 2003.  The subject is becoming a high priority for VMA members, given the prominence of energy issues today generally, and the imminence of the date when choice will be available to Virginia customers. We envision that Enron's message could be encouraging for VMA members who today hear much about the dilemma in California (another seminar participant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives in California and other states) and understandably wonder about the prospects for successful competition and effective choice in Virginia.  Enron could hopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers once the day of choice arrives, touching on Enron's online trading platform, aggregation possibilities (an alternative which the VMA, as an umbrella organization, is considering), and related topics. The seminar will begin at 8:30am and conclude at 4:30pm, with the possible Enron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1:00pm.  We expect good attendance on the part of VMA members, and plan to offer attendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel, legislators and others who have been closely involved  with the development of the Virginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years or so. I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, and again thank you for your assistance.  I will be happy to discuss the particulars with you or anyone else, should that be helpful, and can be reached at AEP's state office in Richmond at 804-698-5511.

Executive Committee Weekly Meeting 
Lockyer writes a very belated letter to the LA Times---""regret"" of the slimy variety: My comment about introducing an energy company executive to the ugly reality of a prison cell was repeated recently by columnist Peter King (June 10) and has become fodder for commentaries that suggest I might think that prison rape is proper punishment for criminals. My anger over the activities of energy barons doesn't come close to my lifelong outrage at the crime of rape. As attorney general I significantly reordered my department's priorities in order to complete the DNA offender database this year. I also sponsored new laws to help fight rape crimes. My office prosecuted prison guards charged with encouraging inmate rapes at Corcoran State Prison. I guess I let my anger get the better of me in talking about the mercenary corporate executives who are making life so miserable for millions of Californians. I should have made my point--that even the most powerful corporate executives are not beyond the law--without the crude remark. Bill Lockyer Attorney General Sacramento

Touche' The Wisdom of Will Rogers Don't squat with your spurs on. Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment. Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in. If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to make sure it's still there. If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' somebody else's dog  around. After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut. Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day. There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works. If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'. Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco. It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep. Always drink upstream from the  herd. When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be surprised if they learn their lesson. When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around by somebody else. The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in your  pocket. Never miss a good chance to shut up. There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for  themselves. 
Even though I'm a Bush/Cheney supporter, I had to pass this one along... George Bush and Dick Cheney are enjoying a celebration dinner at a fancy Washington restaurant.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve= ral=20 months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.= =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues. What happened in California The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state. In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price. Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt. In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices. At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis. Enron=01,s Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts: ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility. You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018= of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts: ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times. Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services.

Even though I'm a Bush/Cheney supporter, I had to pass this one along... George Bush and Dick Cheney are enjoying a celebration dinner at a fancy Washington restaurant.

Touche' The Wisdom of Will Rogers Don't squat with your spurs on. Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment. Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in. If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to make sure it's still there. If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' somebody else's dog  around. After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut. Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day. There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works. If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'. Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco. It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep. Always drink upstream from the  herd. When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be surprised if they learn their lesson. When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around by somebody else. The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in your  pocket. Never miss a good chance to shut up. There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for  themselves.

Hi Sherri, Beth asked me to see if you might help us with locating space on the 50th floor from January 2nd - January 25th. As we did last January, we would like to setup editing equipment at the Enron building for putting together the Analyst Meeting tapes. I know that the office we used in January is now occupied, but Beth wondered if either Joe Suttons former office or Rob Wahl's old office might be available.  Locating the editing equipment in the building makes it easier for those Enron folks involved in the process to stay close to the process. If you are able to help us with this, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Richard Yeats

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve= ral=20 months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.= =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues. What happened in California The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr= eased=20 the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20 restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So= =20 demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul= t,=20 predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state. In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price. Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt. In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices. At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis. Enron=01,s Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts: ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility. You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018= of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts: ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue = to=20 receive the financial benefits of their contract prices. ? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them= =20 with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20 reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times. Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its= =20 crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20 continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western= =20 power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services. The Solution The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary= , the=20 state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark= et=20 and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities. Increasing Supply California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing= =20 short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les= s=20 than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl= y=20 must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20 generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the= =20 regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20 displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can= =20 have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20 facilities. Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. = =20 They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail= =20 market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman= d=20 at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market= . Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20 volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer= =20 term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han= ds=20 of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market= . =20 Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the= ir=20 price risk. Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20 greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to= =20 arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov= er=20 their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and= =20 distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is= =20 needed. Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that= ,=20 while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters= =20 worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work= ed;=20 and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages= ,=20 which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20 ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether = it=20 is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall= ey=20 or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20 shortage worse. The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20 California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that= =20 the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20 constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in= =20 California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20 generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road= s=20 and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do. As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t= he=20 crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron= will=20 continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20 solutions to the state. =20

Sherry, thanks for your guidance concerning the possibility of an Enron participant for the VMA's Seminar on Electric Utility Restructuring scheduled for June 19, 2001.  I serve as Chairman of the VMA's Energy Resources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and the day-long agenda it will entail. As I explained, depending upon the availability of Mr. Skilling or another key individual, the VMA  is offering Enron an opportunity to participate in its seminar in an important way.  We seek to have Enron speak on the subject of the developing competitive market and how that market may be accessible and beneficial to VMA's member manufacturers which include many, if not most, of the large companies residing in Virginia.  The purpose of the seminar is entirely educational, as customers in Virginia will be able, under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passed in 1999, to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 1, 2002, and by no later than January 1, 2003.  The subject is becoming a high priority for VMA members, given the prominence of energy issues today generally, and the imminence of the date when choice will be available to Virginia customers. We envision that Enron's message could be encouraging for VMA members who today hear much about the dilemma in California (another seminar participant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives in California and other states) and understandably wonder about the prospects for successful competition and effective choice in Virginia.  Enron could hopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers once the day of choice arrives, touching on Enron's online trading platform, aggregation possibilities (an alternative which the VMA, as an umbrella organization, is considering), and related topics. The seminar will begin at 8:30am and conclude at 4:30pm, with the possible Enron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1:00pm.  We expect good attendance on the part of VMA members, and plan to offer attendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel, legislators and others who have been closely involved  with the development of the Virginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years or so. I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, and again thank you for your assistance.  I will be happy to discuss the particulars with you or anyone else, should that be helpful, and can be reached at AEP's state office in Richmond at 804-698-5511.

I think Ronnie has already left you a brief message about eAccess. Let me fill you in with some more background information about us. I am the founder of DDI (the second largest wireline and wireless private telecom operator in Japan). Today's DDI market capitalization is around $20 billion. I left DDI at the end of 1995 and became a professor and Keio University Business School for 4 years. I have also been an active member in the government telecom deregulation committee. I left Keio University last year and founded eAccess in November 1999. With less than one year in operation, eAccess has already established a strong presence in the Japanese telecom market. We have three phases in our long-term business plan, (1) broadband access network; (2) CSP and ASP streaming related business; (3) IP metropolitan backbone infrastructure business. As we are currently looking for the best global strategic partner to achieve the goal together, we believe that Enron could become a strong potential partner in Japan. If you need any more information about eAccess, please do not hesitate to call or email me. I am looking forward to seeing you on October 13.

Mr. Skilling, We are a group of EE&CC engineers and we have an idea about trading gasoline online. Enron can trade gasoline as a commodity the same as natural gas and electricity.  The idea is any one can buy an amount of gasoline at a pre-determined price with a certain premium for an extended period.  Which means there is an expiration date for the investor or buyer. When the gasoline price is low, such as last year, people are able to buy a certain amount of gasoline from Enron,( Enron is to negotiate with gasoline producer for an amount and certain price (whole sale) that Enron believes they can sold in a certain period of time through market study and be able to make the profit), say  3000 gallons regular unleaded and with 10% (the profit margin to be determined  by Enron) premium.  The buyer will receive a debit or credit card to be used to purchase the gasoline and  the amount will be automatically recorded  each time when they fill up the cars until the amount of pre-purchased gasoline is used up in that period of time (prior to the expiration date).  The buyers (or customer) can also sell the unused gasoline back to Enron anytime before the expiration day the same price they bought from Enron for profit if the market gas price is lower or take a loss if the market price is higher.   By doing this, Enron creates a market that can allow customers to short the gasoline when the market is high. There are many other ways to trade the gasoline. Nevertheless, the potential market ( if a minimum of 50% household can sign up) is tremendous.  I sincerely believe that Enron has the capability to make it happen through existing Enron online e-business. We hope this idea has not been thought out before for its feasibility.

The idea is any one can buy an amount of gasoline at a pre-determined price with a certain premium for an extended period.  Which means there is an expiration date for the investor or buyer. When the gasoline price is low, such as last year, people are able to buy a certain amount of gasoline from Enron,( Enron is to negotiate with gasoline producer for an amount and certain price (whole sale) that Enron believes they can sold in a certain period of time through market study and be able to make the profit), say  3000 gallons regular unleaded and with 10% (the profit margin to be determined  by Enron) premium.  The buyer will receive a debit or credit card to be used to purchase the gasoline and  the amount will be automatically recorded  each time when they fill up the cars until the amount of pre-purchased gasoline is used up in that period of time (prior to the expiration date).  The buyers (or customer) can also sell the unused gasoline back to Enron anytime before the expiration day the same price they bought from Enron for profit if the market gas price is lower or take a loss if the market price is higher.   By doing this, Enron creates a market that can allow customers to short the gasoline when the market is high. There are many other ways to trade the gasoline. Nevertheless, the potential market ( if a minimum of 50% household can sign up) is tremendous.  I sincerely believe that Enron has the capability to make it happen through existing Enron online e-business. We hope this idea has not been thought out before for its feasibility.

Dear Mr. Schaeffer, Apologies for the delay in responding to your e-mail below. Jeff has given your proposal serious consideration.  However, given the current demands on his time, he has decided to decline your offer to join the Cogent Communications Advisory Committee. On behalf of Jeff, many thanks for the opportunity and best wishes for success. Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com ""Dave Schaeffer"" <ds@cogentco.com> on 11/21/2000 10:37:17 AM 
Dear Jeff, Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last year. I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan. Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners. Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to speaking with you and catching up. Sincerely, Dave Schaeffer, CEO 202-295-4201 
Patti, It was good to see you and Mike last night. I wanted to follow up on the MS150 - I can assure you that you will do fine without training (assuming, of course, that you have a bike).  I did it that way twice before with no major complications.  Given your running, you will do better.  It really is a lot of fun. Sherri is checking to see if you can join the Enron team.  We will be the first team off on Saturday morning and the team has good facilities (tents, food, etc.) that improve the experience.  GO FOR IT!! Jeff PS - hi, Patti - this is Sherri.  I did check with our team captain and she said you could join our team so long as you do so by Friday.  She is going to e-mail all the necessary forms and information to me, which I will forward to 
They don't have to be with the others, so this is perfect.  Thanks, Greg.  If it's easier, I can come to you...I know you guys are swamped.  SRS PS - I didn't realize that I sent you an e-mail from Jeff's box - didn't mean to alarm you if I did! Greg Grissom 04/05/2000 11:12 AM 
Sherri- This is not a problem.  I probably can't get them with the other two but they will be in the same area.  I will bring them up some time this afternoon. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks! Greg 
Greg, if there are two more tickets available for sale for Friday's game, I'd 
Mark, Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.  He is in the process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to guage your interest.  He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation area and the Serengeti.  I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once received from the guides. Please let us know if you're at all interested. 
Brad, as I am cleaning out Jeff's e-mails, I came across this one from you. It appears to me that it has not been opened, so I'm checking to find out if you got the answer to your question.  Please let me know, and I'll try to get the information for you.  If we dropped the ball on this, I apologize. Sherri Sera x3-5984 
Not necessary yet, Karen, but thanks.  Fitz is out of the office until Monday, so there won't be any action taken until then.  Thanks again, SRS Karen Marshall@ECT 03/29/2000 03:44 PM 
Thanks Sherri. Franz Alphonse did not interview with Enron.  He may be interested in a business venture related to his company??  I can pull his resume for you if you like.  Just let me know. Thanks, Karen Marshall Enron North America Corp. 
Not a problem, Kimberly.  Thanks for the heads up.  If Franz calls before Monday, I'll transfer him to you.  SRS 
Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular ""5 minutes"") about his company.  Jeff has asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 617.493.5597. (Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse - i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do). Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to Franz. SRS PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his 
Thank you for the information, Brian.  I'll make sure Jeff sees this. For your information, should a need arise for you to give Jeff completely confidential information, his voicemail is the only secure means to do so (I do not have his password).  His extension is 3-6894.  Otherwise, all mail (e-mail included) is opened by me. Again, thank you for your quick response for information.  SRS Brian Schaffer 03/29/2000 07:53 AM 
Jeff: His name is Richard Heidecker, who was sending e-mails to Joe.  Mr. Heidecker claimed that he was fired from Enron because of an alleged disability.  Our investigation determined that there was no merit to his allegation.  However, Mr. Heidecker continued to attempt communications with Joe.  I felt that it was prudent  to alert OOC by the message below not to engage in unnecessary communications with potential litigants.  I have not heard anything from Mr. Heidecker in several weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Brian 
Dear Mr. Buttrey, Jeff received your e-mail and asked me to respond on his behalf as he is traveling.  He would really enjoy having lunch with you on your next visit to Houston.  Please give him a call when your plans are firm...he can be reached at 713.853.6894. Jeff also inquired as to what you are up to these days.  When you have a minute, please drop him another line.

Jeff, I don't know if you have heard, but WA won the state basketball tournement last weekend.? I have ordered the Beacon News for last Sunday and would be happy to make copies and send to you.? Kerkman is still the head coach in his 24th year.? The point guard on the team is John Fowler.? John's dad is Herman Fowler who played in 71. Hope all is going great for you.? I know the opening of Enron Field is keeping you busy as well as running Enron. I need to come to Houston soon.? Would there be a time I could run by and say hi or buy you a sandwich for lunch? Hope to hear from you. Mike Buttrey 
Dear Ms. Siska, On behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling, I am responding to a request from Mr. Warren Staley to forward to you the name of Enron's contact with regard to an information exchange on leadership development between Enron and Cargill. Mr. Skilling suggests that you call Mr. Steve Kean, EVP and Chief of Staff. Mr. Kean can be reached at 713.853.1586 or via e-mail at steven.kean@enron.com.

Rachael, well, I was wrong again.  Jeff said he is not interested in doing the morning broadcast with Sam Malone; no reason given, so I didn't ask. Sorry!  SRS Rachael Tobor 03/28/2000 10:25 AM 
Jeff, Sam Malone would love for you to join him live at the Morning Show broadcast from the Enron Building on April 7.  The optimal time to speak with Sam is between 7 and 8 am, but not at the top or bottom of the hour .  He wants the opportunity to banter with you on air about why Enron is the best place to work, Enron Field and what you have been doing lately.   It will be very informal, and depending on your schedule, he welcomes you to stay as long as you can. Please let me know when you are available. Rachael 
Brian, Jeff would like to know who the individual was that was communicating with the OOC.  He doesn't recall this situation - please advise.  Thanks, Sherri x3-5984 Brian Schaffer 03/20/2000 08:13 AM 
Ken/Jeff/Joe: As you may know, I have recently been hired to direct the new Office of Labor and Employment Relations (formerly Fair Employment and Labor Practices).  One of the many major roles of my group is to conduct investigations into employee allegations of discrimination, harassment, and other unfair treatment. One recent investigation involved an employee who was communicating via e-mail with your office on a constant and unyielding basis.  As experience shows, this is not an uncommon occurrence as some employees feel that they must go to the top to get attention. As you have been doing, please direct all such employee communications to me for prompt processing.  This will enable you to avoid being subjected to depositions and trial testimony in any subsequent legal proceeding as a fact witness.  Naturally, I will keep you informed as to the results of the investigation to any extent that you desire. Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. Brian 
Samual, Jeff will be happy to take a photo for the Encounter.  Just let me know the details so we can make sure he's where he needs to be at the appointed time. Good luck with the ride. Sherri x3-5984 
Good morning, Yelba. It has been a long time!  You may not remember me, but I have been working with Jeff since the McKinsey days (my name used to be ""Baumbach""). After reviewing your e-mail, Jeff suggests that you speak to Lou Pai, Chairman & CEO of Enron Energy Services; his telephone number is 713.853.5646.  By copy of this e-mail, he is advised that you will contact him. Good luck with your venture, Yelba, and welcome back to Houston.  If I can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to call me.  And please tell Richard that we said hello.

Hi Jeff, Don't know if you remember me from your old McKinsey days, but I am Richard Saettone's wife. The entire family is finally back in Houston after several years in Peru.  I am working for a company called Home-Link Services, and wanted to request your aid in finding the correct person to talk to at Enron regarding our business model. We currently represent over 200,000 transactions per year (people moving), and one of the most requested services from our customers is the connection of utilities.  As an aggregator for the energy sector with that type of volume, who do you recommend we call?  We are expected to grow to about 500,000 transactions by year-end. Feel free to call me with any questions.  I would be most happy to send you or the proper Enron contact an executive summary for review. Richard sends his regards and we hope your family is doing well. Yelba R.

Mr. Skilling does have an appointment in New York at 8:00 a.m. on April 12  that would be very difficult to reschedule.  Given this time constraint, I'm not sure it will work.

I am sure you are aware that as part of  first ever Risk Awards - published in January - Enron Corporation achieved the  accolade: Energy/commodity derivatives house of the  year. This award was won, not simply  because of your lead in energy and power in the US, but because of the lead  Enron has taken in new areas of risk management. We very much hope you can join us to be presented  with the Award at the Risk 2000 Europe Congress in Paris on April 11th - we  invite you to attend the conference as a full delegate and I am sure there are a  number of sessions which will be of interest to you. A formal invitation will  follow from our editor. We also intend to publish a special  supplement that will provide Awards winners with an excellent opportunity to  celebrate their achievements through advertising. This supplement will be distributed with the  March issue of Risk and to all delegates attending the Risk 2000  Congress. For more details on the  Risk 2000 congress please click this link: http://www.riskpublications.com/risk2000euro/index.htm I hope that my email is clear and I will  contact you shortly to find-out your reactions to our proposal - however if you  have any questions beforehand - please feel free to contact  me.

Dear Neil, Jeff asked me to let you know that he will be at Paul Hobby's open house this evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.  In the event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll see what we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.

Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend a minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to introduce Genesis Park which is a ""new economy"" investment company that's been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the Enron/Genesis business relationship. I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but hopefully it's worth some discussion. If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly you could come to our ""offices"" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech shed on the property! Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee. I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any questions you may have. To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged. Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.

However, given the current demands on his time, he must respectfully decline your invitation. Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do what I can to facilitate that for you. Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the the opportunity.

Hi Jeff. I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the ""truth"").  Is there anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the better. I will schedule a ""special"" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any dates that work for you. I look forward to hearing from you. Ronnie Morgan 760-476-0700 
Stephanie, I don't have all of Jeff's pledges collected yet!  Do you want what I have (about 65%) or shall I wait until all have been collected?  I'll send out another e-mail today to the slackers ;-)  Let me know.  SRS 
Gil, Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline. It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well. Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-) ""Gil Marmol"" <gmarmol@gmarmol.com> on 05/14/2001 03:27:50 PM 
Jeff, Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated- CEO ship, the blowout first quarter, and the recent piece in Bloomberg. Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron (EES, Enron Networks, Global Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet sites are examples of the results of this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators that Enron will use going forward. David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading the work at Enron.  He and Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with you, bringing you up to date on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board. I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know of their interest.  He will be following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with them. Regards, Gil Marmol

Jay, I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is 
Jeff- As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron. For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept. The purpose of this note is twofold. First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly. Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor. At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!). Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward. Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work! Jay

Jeff, I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference.

Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it was great to see you. As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation, scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus). All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an effort to see if this can be put together. Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled: (1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic thinking (officially ""Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New Economy"").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed, and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9. (2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The emphasis of the conference will be on our ""e-Business Transformation"" (more specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles, customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our ""Value Network"" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors, shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our corporate offices (about 250 people, total). Let me know if you need any additional background or information. Eric

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from where.

I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).

Hello Jeff, I submitted a  question that didn't get answered at the meeting.  I was hoping you could respond. We routinely see citizens of a country hold an ""inferior"" currency despite the presence of superior alternatives.  The incumbent currency has a smaller bid/ask spread, and a network externality  locks-in  the inferior currency. Volume creates lower spreads and lower spreads in turn attract more volume, conferring a monopoly status on the incumbent currency. Do you think that Enron Online is taking advantage of a similar network externality?  How do our bid/ask spreads compare to the alternatives available to our competitors?  Do we stand willing to match our competitors bid/offer? A final note:  I was curious to learn what you did to become so successful. Is there a place where your biography or resume is posted? Thanks in advance, David Porter. 
Thank you, Rod!  SRS

OK Sherri how much do you want? Kevin Jeff Skilling@ENRON Sent by: Sherri Sera@ENRON 04/19/01 05:18 PM 
I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you! Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal? Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow... Sherri :-) 
$50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you. Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS Enron Energy Services 
Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you - I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick turnaround.  SRS

Various Beta Buttheads, OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to play and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I have confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this year's homecoming game: Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2, Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5 (he's bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was). Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need to order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all these plans. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.

I have a letter from you to Jeff dated November 15, 2000, regarding a wire transfer in the amount of $110,109.00.

Dear Mr. Thornton, We are in receipt of your letter to Jeff Skilling dated March 30, 2001.

Gentlemen, I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling regarding scheduling a 20-minute conference call to discuss the above referenced presentation/panel discussion at the Houston Chapter YPO (Young Presidents Organization) meeting.  Jeff is available the afternoon of Thursday, April 12, between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. (CDT).  Please let me know what your availability is during this time period, and I'll be back in touch to nail down an exact time or to suggest an alternative date/time. Thank you very much for your commitment to this event and for your patience in awaiting the details.  I look forward to hearing from each of you soon.

Mike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the SUN demonstration. With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them. Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and the meeting room set up ""class room"" style.  If we go with the plated breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 ""10-tops,"" there will be no space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then. I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.

Dera Mr. Skilling, Just a short e-mail to invite you to a meeting that I will be having with Carl Carter in your on-line development team at 1.00pm on the 27th floor in your offices located at 1400 Smith. Financial Market Solutions (FMS) is a leading financial software company located in Bellevue, Washington. The company is dedicated to the development and implementation of Internet-based trading solutions for institutions in the global financial marketplace.  The central component of all FMS solutions is the Universal Trading Platform (UTP), which is a dynamic web-based platform that enables unlimited numbers of simultaneous users to access the system and execute trades on a fully automated basis. This basic premise distinguishes FMS from other solution providers and gives our clients the ability to more effectively manage the liquidity of multiple users, trading over the Internet on a single platform. The UTP has been fully developed as a complete Foreign Exchange dealing system, however, the same platform can be used for transactions in any tradable financial instrument. FMS has employed a team of expert software designers and technicians as well as experienced professionals from the financial markets, who together have designed and developed the UTP to transform the way the FX product is delivered to end-users. The platform is equally suited to the needs of large institutional users as well as retail investors. The FMS system, using the latest technology, is the most advanced on-line trading system available today and will likely shape the FX business model of the future. We have made some majorprogress over the last 15 months and are poised to announce some key relationships that will have a mojor impact in the FX industry. I understand that you are very busy, and that this invitation is unsolicited but as they say nothing ventured nothing gained. Kind Regards, Kenny McBride V.P.

Hi Jeff, Update:  I am a good friend of John Millers in Atlanta. We actually met at his wedding. I am coming to Houston next week and have a 1:30 appt on the 15th.  with Bill Donovan to demonstrate what we do...long story but he is excited to see what we do. I was thinking maybe we could grab an early lunch before the meeting. Let me know.

Thanks, Matthew.  Let me know when I should have Jeff arrive in London in the event you or John Sherriff want to set up other customer meetings while he's there.  I will have him return to Houston on Friday, 9/28, but he could arrive in London as early as Tuesday, 9/25.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS Matthew Scrimshaw@ECT 02/09/2001 10:59 AM 
Sherri - The date is Thursday 27th September in London.  It will be a lunch format with around 20 attendees.  We will be away from Enron House at a central London location (to be confirmed) between 12.15pm and 2.45pm. Matthew Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Matthew, Jeff's soundbite is ""the transformation of gas and electric markets.""  Hope this helps.  SRS Matthew Scrimshaw@ECT 02/09/2001 03:06 AM 
Sherri - Let me have Jeff's preferred September dates and I'll make sure we get one of them fixed. It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free markets, regulators and California.  Please let me know Jeff's preference. Matthew Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Greetings, Mark.  Can you give Jeff a call at the office today when you have a minute?  He's anxious to talk to you...  713.853.6894.  Hope all went well 
Matthew, the week of 9/24 looks very good right now.  I'll hold that week until I hear back from you.  I'll try to get an answer on the soundbite for you today.  I'll be back in touch.  SRS Matthew Scrimshaw@ECT 02/09/2001 03:06 AM

Jeff, As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows. The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third attended. Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no problem if you decline.

Vince, I am checking the date on Jeff's calendar (I'm assuming the date is February 22?).  I am holding that date whole week for a trip abroad, but I think we have some flexibility on that and am checking it out.  I'll be back in touch as soon as I've resolved that.

Jeff, Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to have you as a keynote speaker. Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn a few times about the program and  I think that this will be an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and agenda for the future. I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation. Vince 
Dear Suzanne, I'm sorry for the delay in returning your e-mail.  We're catching up now after taking some time off over the holidays. Unfortunately, due to Jeff's travel schedule, a meeting in January or even early February is not feasible.  I would be happy to schedule a meeting in late February or early March if that timing works for you.  Please call me should you wish to proceed on that basis.

Dear Jeff, Congratulations on being named Enron's new Chief Executive Officer.  What an outstanding and well-deserved accomplishment. Cary Maguire and Dean Niemi would like to make a trip to Houston in January to visit with you if your schedule permits.  Cary is particularly interested in touring the trading floor.  Would you please let me know if you would be willing to meet with them and, if so, when the best time would be?  Thank you. Also, Liz Williams, SMU's Treasurer, met with Bart Schachter of Blueprint several weeks ago.  She said his fund looks like a good opportunity.  She shared with me that even though SMU is currently over its allocation to venture and private equity and has therefore slowed down on new commitments, the University's investment advisor is evaluating Blueprint.  She also told me that decisions on venture and private equity can often take quite awhile. I will keep you posted on any further developments that I learn.

Shack, Thanks for the nice note.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but I took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  immediately following the announcement. The reunion was really great, and I'm sorry too that we missed each other. Next time you get to Houston, please give me a call (713.853.6894).  It would be great to get together and catch up. Hope you had a great holiday and Happy New Year! -kai- Rocky Craig_Shackleton@amat.com on 12/19/2000 12:52:42 PM 
Rocky, I saw the announcement of your promotion in the Austin paper a couple days ago and wanted to send my congratulations.   I recall our freshman year, you wrote your chemistry paper on energy, I wrote mine on semiconductors.  Little did we know our initial interests as 18 year olds would become our careers. Arends says he sees you regularly when you hold your financial reviews.  I wasn't able to make it to his wedding.  Did you? If so, how was it? Sorry we weren't able to connect at the reunion in October, I really hoped we'd have a chance to catch up on what's happened since we last talked (maybe 15 years ago?).    Hope you aren't overwhelmed with the Beta egroups email banter. It's been fun reacquainting with the brothers.  I'm getting together with Bill Jordan next month in California on one of my trips.  I know you're busy, but if you have a second, drop a reply. I'm proud of your career accomplishments and our shared history and friendship. Good work, worm. Have a great holiday. -kai- Shack 
Wilson, Sorry for the delay in responding to this e-mail - yesterday was Jeff's first day back in the since December 14, so we are catching up! Jeff asked me to let you know that he is very supportive of this opportunity, and has conveyed that to Mr. Lay.  I'm not sure what next steps would be, but please feel free to call on us should you need our assistance further. Regards, SRS Wilson Kriegel@EES 12/15/2000 04:10 PM 
Mr. Skilling, First, let me congratulate you on being appointed to CEO of Enron. Very exciting news! Mr. Lay may have spoken to you about NewPowers' desire to be the premier energy provider to Enron employees. - If you had a moment, please take the time to read and reflect on the opportunity of this project. - As you will notice, I was assigned to lead the project and am looking forward to working with Enron (again). I look forward to  the opportunity of seeing you again, while I am in Texas; and I hope that you will find it worth your while to provide input to this project. Having a good understanding of Enron and it's culture, I strongly believe that your direct support will have a huge effect on the success of the project. Below is the Email that Mr. Lockhart sent to Mr. Lay: As part of NewPower's plan to enter Texas, we would appreciate your support to implement a plan to offer Enron Employees the opportunity to sign up to NewPower when deregulation opens on February 15th.  We believe that an Enron Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity and customized offers to employees at Enron's partners could be a cost effective way for NewPower to help achieve our goal to be the branded choice of electricity in Texas We have developed some compelling ""Consumer Driven"" sign up incentives for Enron Employees such as ""Guaranteed Savings - Free December"" electricity, a aligned to a $20.00 NewPower ATM card and free companion airline ticket coupons. We would appreciate your help and support on the following: Obtaining Enron Executive support/guidance for our proposed Enron Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity. - It would be helpful to have your personal endorsement linked to implementation assistance through Cindy Olson's HR group. Guidance and support for a similar ""Customized"" offer to Enron's partners employees that might include Vincent & Elkins, Compaq, Arthur Andersen, Continental, University of Houston, University of Houston American Airlines. - We would appreciate any thoughts on other companies we should approach. - It would be helpful if you would consider sending  a letter or email of introduction to the companies CEO and head of Human Resources in the near future. To help you understand more about the proposed plan, attached, please find a copy of the plan highlights and draft creative that was sent by Nick Utton (Chief Marketing Officer) to Cindy Olson.  Nick is currently in discussions with Cindy on how to best implement this plan and has assigned Wilson Kriegel as the NewPower manager responsible for working through the details. I look forward to your input and help. This could go a long way in Texas towards our goal of NewPower being the national brand of ""Energy Solutions"". Wilson Kriegel

Dear Hilary, The items Mr. Skilling purchased have arrived in Houston and I'm working with a customs broker to get them out of KLM Cargo.  The broker has indicated that the packing list and tax invoice are not descriptive enough to get the items out of customs, so I need to provide them with a detailed list of items, what they are made of and what he paid for them.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling is out of the country until January 2, 2001, and KLM will only hold these items until December 23 when they send them to some government warehouse.

It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture! I never was able to open the document that was sent twice, which I believe had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases. That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to the football game Saturday.

Jeff: I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you regarding a tremendous potential business opportunity that has to do with trading of Foreign Exchange Online . The idea is to bring the clients and the banks together where  the banks can bid to buy or sell when business clients wants to buy or sell certain currency. My understanding is that the total foreign exchange turnover per day is in several trillion dollar range.  Currently, I am working in Santa Cruz, Bolivia as President/General Manager of Bolivian portion of Bolivia to Brazil pipeline and may not be up to speed on Enron's activities in this area.   If we are already doing this, please disregard this note and accept my appologies for taking your time and, if we are not doing this, here is my two cents worth and let me know if I can do anything to implement it. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your leadership in making this such a great company. I have been with the company for last twenty years and it has been a phenomenal experience. The best part is that we have just  began.  I am very excited about  the future growth opportunities of  EBS and am looking forward to contributing in that area one of these days. Regards, Nasim Khan

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling (who, by the way, has really enjoyed the old pictures being e-mailed back and forth).  He has asked me to find out what the schedule of events is for the SMU Homecoming October 27-29.  He's unable to attend any events on the evening of Saturday, October 28, as he will be at the wedding of a very good friend; however, if there are events scheduled outside of that time, he would very much like to be there. Can you provide this information or pass me on to whomever can?  Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax)

Dear Ms. Kurz, I spoke to Mr. Skilling regarding your e-mail below.  Of course he is always willing to entertain opportunities for NED's; however, given the current demands on his time, it would have to be something pretty significant in order that he would pursue and/or accept such an appointment. With regard to the specific company you have in mind, he is happy to review any written information you may have.  Once he has had a chance to review it, we will contact you to let you know his level of interest and to set up follow-on discussions if appropriate.  By mail or Federal Express, the information may be sent to: Jeffrey K. Skilling President & COO Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB5007 Houston, TX  77002 Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Jeff, I am a Partner with Whitehead Mann and rang you today to introduce myself and my firm.  We are an executive search consultancy who act for large global organizations to find Non-Executive Directors(NED)for their Boards.  At any one time, we have a number of European clients who are keen to have American nationals join their Boards due to their growing interests in the US. I am approaching you to see if you would ever entertain taking on a NED position.  I have a specific client in mind which is a Paris-based, global industrial company with worldwide revenues in excess of $15 billion. I know that you have just returned from holiday and have a busy schedule over the next few weeks, but I would be grateful if you could let me know if you would be interested in talking further about Board appointments.  I can be reached at 212 551 3552 or via e-mail at your convenience. I look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Barbara Kurz

Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe it has already come and gone! Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted. We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 30th. Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

Jeff, We spent quite a bit of time over the past several months discussing a possible minority investment of about $5MM in Silicon Energy.  We have broken off those discussions because (1) their proposed pre-money valuation of $150MM was, in our opinion, excessive, and (2) our people at EES, who would be the primary users of Silicon Energy, were not happy with Silicon Energy's functionality. With this in mind, have you had discussions with John which we should know about or which would help give us strategic direction? Thanks, Kevin W. Kuykendall

Hi, Mark.  Hope you enjoyed Italy - I was in Capri and Positano a couple of weeks ago and loved it! Jeff asked me to write you to see if the plan he is hatching will work for you... He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out later... You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough sketch of the safari is as follows: 7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club 7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at Ngorongoro Crater Lodge 7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge 7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey Hope it sounds good to you.  Please let me know and I'll begin making flight arrangements, etc...I'm also collecting all the information with regard to required Visas and innoculations (there is a long list!); I'll pass that on when I receive it. I'm heading to Las Vegas tomorrow for a long weekend, so will be in touch again early next week. 
Metin, Great to hear from you.  Believe it or not, my brother lives in Istanbul and my son Jeffrey and I are going to visit him this summer - somewhere in the June 23 to June 28 timeframe.  I'd love to see you if it's possible.  I'll let you know when my plans are firm.

Dear Mr. Paul, I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he will send you a check in the amount of $200. While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is $350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so actively support research to find a cure. I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a nice weekend.

Metin, Great to hear from you.  Believe it or not, my brother lives in Istanbul and my son Jeffrey and I are going to visit him this summer - somewhere in the June 23 to June 28 timeframe.  I'd love to see you if it's possible.  I'll let you know when my plans are firm. 
Hi, Mark.  Hope you enjoyed Italy - I was in Capri and Positano a couple of weeks ago and loved it! Jeff asked me to write you to see if the plan he is hatching will work for you... He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out later... You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough sketch of the safari is as follows: 7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club 7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at Ngorongoro Crater Lodge 7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge 7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp 7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp 7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp 7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey Hope it sounds good to you.  Please let me know and I'll begin making flight arrangements, etc...I'm also collecting all the information with regard to required Visas and innoculations (there is a long list!); I'll pass that on when I receive it. I'm heading to Las Vegas tomorrow for a long weekend, so will be in touch again early next week. 
Hi, Kristin, Your Dad asked me to let you know that he got your message.  He would like to meet you at Maggiones (the place you two met for lunch the first time).  I'm making a reservation for you guys in his name at 1:00 p.m. Would you please reply to this e-mail so I know you got it?  Thanks, Kristin, and have a nice lunch.

Jeff, We spent quite a bit of time over the past several months discussing a possible minority investment of about $5MM in Silicon Energy.  We have broken off those discussions because (1) their proposed pre-money valuation of $150MM was, in our opinion, excessive, and (2) our people at EES, who would be the primary users of Silicon Energy, were not happy with Silicon Energy's functionality. With this in mind, have you had discussions with John which we should know about or which would help give us strategic direction? Thanks, Kevin W. Kuykendall

Wilson, Sorry for the delay in responding to this e-mail - yesterday was Jeff's first day back in the since December 14, so we are catching up!

I'm not sure what next steps would be, but please feel free to call on us should you need our assistance further. Regards, SRS Wilson Kriegel@EES 12/15/2000 04:10 PM 
Mr. Skilling, First, let me congratulate you on being appointed to CEO of Enron. Very exciting news! Mr. Lay may have spoken to you about NewPowers' desire to be the premier energy provider to Enron employees. - If you had a moment, please take the time to read and reflect on the opportunity of this project. - As you will notice, I was assigned to lead the project and am looking forward to working with Enron (again). I look forward to  the opportunity of seeing you again, while I am in Texas; and I hope that you will find it worth your while to provide input to this project. Having a good understanding of Enron and it's culture, I strongly believe that your direct support will have a huge effect on the success of the project. Below is the Email that Mr. Lockhart sent to Mr. Lay: As part of NewPower's plan to enter Texas, we would appreciate your support to implement a plan to offer Enron Employees the opportunity to sign up to NewPower when deregulation opens on February 15th.  We believe that an Enron Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity and customized offers to employees at Enron's partners could be a cost effective way for NewPower to help achieve our goal to be the branded choice of electricity in Texas We have developed some compelling ""Consumer Driven"" sign up incentives for Enron Employees such as ""Guaranteed Savings - Free December"" electricity, a aligned to a $20.00 NewPower ATM card and free companion airline ticket coupons. We would appreciate your help and support on the following: Obtaining Enron Executive support/guidance for our proposed Enron Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity. - It would be helpful to have your personal endorsement linked to implementation assistance through Cindy Olson's HR group. Guidance and support for a similar ""Customized"" offer to Enron's partners employees that might include Vincent & Elkins, Compaq, Arthur Andersen, Continental, University of Houston, University of Houston American Airlines. - We would appreciate any thoughts on other companies we should approach. - It would be helpful if you would consider sending  a letter or email of introduction to the companies CEO and head of Human Resources in the near future. To help you understand more about the proposed plan, attached, please find a copy of the plan highlights and draft creative that was sent by Nick Utton (Chief Marketing Officer) to Cindy Olson.  Nick is currently in discussions with Cindy on how to best implement this plan and has assigned Wilson Kriegel as the NewPower manager responsible for working through the details. I look forward to your input and help. This could go a long way in Texas towards our goal of NewPower being the national brand of ""Energy Solutions"". Wilson Kriegel

Rocky, I saw the announcement of your promotion in the Austin paper a couple days ago and wanted to send my congratulations.   I recall our freshman year, you wrote your chemistry paper on energy, I wrote mine on semiconductors.  Little did we know our initial interests as 18 year olds would become our careers. Arends says he sees you regularly when you hold your financial reviews.  I wasn't able to make it to his wedding.  Did you? If so, how was it? Sorry we weren't able to connect at the reunion in October, I really hoped we'd have a chance to catch up on what's happened since we last talked (maybe 15 years ago?).    Hope you aren't overwhelmed with the Beta egroups email banter. It's been fun reacquainting with the brothers.  I'm getting together with Bill Jordan next month in California on one of my trips.  I know you're busy, but if you have a second, drop a reply. I'm proud of your career accomplishments and our shared history and friendship. Good work, worm. Have a great holiday. -kai- Shack

Cary Maguire and Dean Niemi would like to make a trip to Houston in January to visit with you if your schedule permits.  Cary is particularly interested in touring the trading floor.  Would you please let me know if you would be willing to meet with them and, if so, when the best time would be?  Thank you. Also, Liz Williams, SMU's Treasurer, met with Bart Schachter of Blueprint several weeks ago.  She said his fund looks like a good opportunity.  She shared with me that even though SMU is currently over its allocation to venture and private equity and has therefore slowed down on new commitments, the University's investment advisor is evaluating Blueprint.

Jeff, As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows. The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third attended. Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no problem if you decline.

Sherri - Let me have Jeff's preferred September dates and I'll make sure we get one of them fixed. It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free markets, regulators and California.  Please let me know Jeff's preference. Matthew Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Greetings, Mark.  Can you give Jeff a call at the office today when you have a minute?  He's anxious to talk to you...  713.853.6894.  Hope all went well 
Matthew, Jeff's soundbite is ""the transformation of gas and electric markets.""  Hope this helps.  SRS Matthew Scrimshaw@ECT 02/09/2001 03:06 AM 
Sherri - Let me have Jeff's preferred September dates and I'll make sure we get one of them fixed. It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free markets, regulators and California.  Please let me know Jeff's preference. Matthew Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Thanks, Matthew.  Let me know when I should have Jeff arrive in London in the event you or John Sherriff want to set up other customer meetings while he's there.  I will have him return to Houston on Friday, 9/28, but he could arrive in London as early as Tuesday, 9/25.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS Matthew Scrimshaw@ECT 02/09/2001 10:59 AM 
Sherri - The date is Thursday 27th September in London.  It will be a lunch format with around 20 attendees.  We will be away from Enron House at a central London location (to be confirmed) between 12.15pm and 2.45pm. Matthew Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
Dear Mr. Brannen, Jeff has left for the day, so has not yet seen your note.  However, I wanted to let you know that the timing may not work on February 15.  He is attending a board meeting that morning, which is followed by a luncheon.  There is not much daylight in the afternoon, either, but I'll check with him first thing Monday morning to see if there is anything we can do to free up a few minutes. Have a nice weekend.

I hope all is going well and congratulations on your formal recognition as CEO.. Cheers Bill  P.S. Steve Ballmer mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that his meeting with you

Dear Ms. Gallanter, Jeff is traveling abroad this week, so I have taken the liberty of responding to your request in his absence. Enron's board of directors meeting and annual shareholder meeting is scheduled to take place in Houston on Tuesday, May 1, making it impossible for Jeff to accept your invitation. Joanna Gallanter <joanna@venturestrategy.com> on 02/28/2001 01:09:24 PM 
Dear Jeff, I just wrapped up a meeting with Pug Winokur, an Enron Board member, and he suggested I contact you to invite you to participate in a CEO forum we host called Build Value 2001 CEO Forum to be held on May 1, 2001 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, California.  The Build Value 2001 forum is a powerful venue to share your perspective and insights with CEOs of high-growth technology companies intent on learning and sharing with one another.  This year's conference is heavily focused on exploring the opportunities and challenges in the converging online and offline marketplaces, and perhaps no other firm understands how to be successful in this market more than Enron. The discussion we would like you to join is among CEOs and business leaders who are in large organizations that have effectively stayed on top of the wave and embracing technological innovation to succeed.  David Pottruck is confirmed to speak on behalf of Schwab and we have invited AG Lafley from P&G and Jeanne Jackson from Walmart to join the discussion.  Your participation on behalf of Enron would clearly be an integral part of the discussion. Now in its fourth year, the Build Value CEO forum has established itself as the premiere learning forum for business executives intent on building successful technology related companies. The annual forum attracts a diverse group (750+) of CEOs and technology leaders who are integral to the continued growth and purpose of this learning community.  The Build Value 2001 CEO forum is not a typical two-day investor conference. Rather it seeks to create a living lab of ""how-to"" success stories that can be referenced by participants throughout the year. This content becomes a valuable guide for many emerging growth companies and can be reviewed online at <http://www.buildvalue2001.com>. Join speakers such as Bob Pittman (AOL), Jeff Mallett (Yahoo!), David Peterschmidt (Inktomi), Shelby Bonnie (CNet), and Mark Walsh (VerticalNet) who presented cutting edge topics to a sold out audience of CEOs at last year's conference titled ""Brands Driving the New Economy"". Prior conferences have also included corporate visionaries and luminaries such as John Hagel III & Marc Singer (McKinsey & Co.), Francis Ford Coppola (Coppola Companies), Howard Schultz (Starbucks), David Aaker (author), Meg Whitman (eBay), Harry Dent (author/speaker), Bob Fisher (Gap), and Cindy Crawford (eStyle, Inc.) to name a few.   We anticipate this year's speaker roster to be even more impressive. Build Value 2001's continuing strategic sponsors, with whom you will have many opportunities to interact, include some of the most innovative and forward thinking players in Silicon Valley today:  Redpoint Ventures, Banc of America Securities, Silicon Valley Bank, CNET, Heidrick & Struggles, Cooley Godward and Citron Haligman Bedecarre.  Venture Strategy Partners, Build Value's founding host, is a venture capital firm focused on accelerating the growth of emerging businesses across a spectrum of technologies. I know your perspective and vision will be greatly appreciated and I, along with my colleagues, would be honored to have you as a distinguished speaker. Our office will follow up with you this coming week to confirm your participation.  In the interim, please feel free to call me directly at 415-558-8600 with any questions or talk with Pug Winokur about the power of this forum. Thank you for your consideration.

Dera Mr. Skilling, Just a short e-mail to invite you to a meeting that I will be having with Carl Carter in your on-line development team at 1.00pm on the 27th floor in your offices located at 1400 Smith. Financial Market Solutions (FMS) is a leading financial software company located in Bellevue, Washington. The company is dedicated to the development and implementation of Internet-based trading solutions for institutions in the global financial marketplace.  The central component of all FMS solutions is the Universal Trading Platform (UTP), which is a dynamic web-based platform that enables unlimited numbers of simultaneous users to access the system and execute trades on a fully automated basis. This basic premise distinguishes FMS from other solution providers and gives our clients the ability to more effectively manage the liquidity of multiple users, trading over the Internet on a single platform. The UTP has been fully developed as a complete Foreign Exchange dealing system, however, the same platform can be used for transactions in any tradable financial instrument. FMS has employed a team of expert software designers and technicians as well as experienced professionals from the financial markets, who together have designed and developed the UTP to transform the way the FX product is delivered to end-users. The platform is equally suited to the needs of large institutional users as well as retail investors. The FMS system, using the latest technology, is the most advanced on-line trading system available today and will likely shape the FX business model of the future. We have made some majorprogress over the last 15 months and are poised to announce some key relationships that will have a mojor impact in the FX industry. I understand that you are very busy, and that this invitation is unsolicited but as they say nothing ventured nothing gained. Kind Regards, Kenny McBride V.P.

Dear Jeff: ? Thanks so much for your kind note regarding the  Symphony Ball. I absolutely understand your situation. As busy as I am, I can't  even begin to imagine all that is on your dance card! ? I would love the chance to visit with you about this and see  if there is any way that I could persuade you to reconsider being the Corporate  Chair. I am certain that it would require only a very minimum amount of your  time. I have?? a well thought out plan for the execution of this event and  honestly feel that you would be very happy with the results. I hope that you  will not think me too much of a nuisance and will not hold it against me for  trying. ? Many thanks, ? Leslie ? ?

Mr. Compton, This meeting is most definitely on. My apologies if there has been any doubt on your part; however, Jeff has been traveling about 90% of the time since mid-February, which has put us a bit behind schedule.

Mike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the SUN demonstration. With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them. Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and the meeting room set up ""class room"" style.  If we go with the plated breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 ""10-tops,"" there will be no space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then. I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you! Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal? Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow... 
Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you - I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick turnaround.  SRS 
$50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you. Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS Enron Energy Services

Jeff, My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and we can go from there. Much Thanks!

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner was cancelled. I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from where. The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the panel. I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m. Regards, SRS 
Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)? Please advise.

Jeff, I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference. Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our commercial and real estate business. Let me know your interest. Regards Delainey

Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it was great to see you. As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation, scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus). All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an effort to see if this can be put together. Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled: (1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic thinking (officially ""Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New Economy"").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed, and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9. (2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The emphasis of the conference will be on our ""e-Business Transformation"" (more specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles, customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our ""Value Network"" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors, shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our corporate offices (about 250 people, total). Let me know if you need any additional background or information. Eric

Jay, I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is 
Jeff- As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron. For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept. The purpose of this note is twofold. First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly. Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor. At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!). Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward. Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work! Jay

Hi Jeff. I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the ""truth"").  Is there anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the better. I will schedule a ""special"" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any dates that work for you. I look forward to hearing from you. Ronnie Morgan 760-476-0700

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted. We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 30th. Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

That is a refundable ticket, so if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it in the mail to: Sherri Sera c/o Enron Corp. P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX 77251-1188 U.S.A. Thanks and take care, 
The ponytail, tattoo and the beard were gone when he showed up last Monday. I hope somebody got some pictures of that!  SRS ""Mark Skilling"" <markskilling@hotmail.com> on 07/25/2000 02:27:45 AM 
Sherri, When I got your message, I was certain I had thrown the ticket away.  But, I was happy to find that I had procrastinated and still had it.  It will be in the mail shortly. The trip did go well; thanks for setting it up. I'm curious to know whether Jeff kept the ponytail and tattoo? Mark 
Thank you for the information, Mr. Haack.  For your information, Jeff does have a Federal Reserve Bank board meeting on the morning of Thursday, September 20, 2001, but we are holding the afternoon of 9/20/01 through 9/22/01 for you.  I look forward to hearing from you with more details in the coming months.

Hi Jeff, It was good talking to you last week!  The dates for the Aspen conference that we talked about are Sept. 20, 21,  and 22.   We would want to target one of those mornings.   Thanks again for agreeing to join us as a presenter (and for any additional part of the conference as well). We'll be in touch to zero in on the specifics.  Thanks again, Bill 
Dear Ms. Kurz, I spoke to Mr. Skilling regarding your e-mail below.  Of course he is always willing to entertain opportunities for NED's; however, given the current demands on his time, it would have to be something pretty significant in order that he would pursue and/or accept such an appointment. With regard to the specific company you have in mind, he is happy to review any written information you may have.  Once he has had a chance to review it, we will contact you to let you know his level of interest and to set up follow-on discussions if appropriate.  By mail or Federal Express, the information may be sent to: Jeffrey K. Skilling President & COO Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB5007 Houston, TX  77002 Thank you for your consideration.  We look forward to hearing from you again soon.

Dear Jeff, I am a Partner with Whitehead Mann and rang you today to introduce myself and my firm.  We are an executive search consultancy who act for large global organizations to find Non-Executive Directors(NED)for their Boards.  At any one time, we have a number of European clients who are keen to have American nationals join their Boards due to their growing interests in the US. I am approaching you to see if you would ever entertain taking on a NED position.  I have a specific client in mind which is a Paris-based, global industrial company with worldwide revenues in excess of $15 billion. I know that you have just returned from holiday and have a busy schedule over the next few weeks, but I would be grateful if you could let me know if you would be interested in talking further about Board appointments.  I can be reached at 212 551 3552 or via e-mail at your convenience. I look forward to hearing from you. Regards, Barbara Kurz 
Hello, Mark.  The person you can speak to at Enron is Eric Shaw=20 (44.207.783.5408) - he heads up that part of Europe out of our London=20 office.  By copy of this e-mail, I'm letting him know to expect your call. Glad to hear all is well.  Good luck with your project!  SRS ""Mark Skilling"" <markskilling@hotmail.com> on 07/31/2000 06:54:52 AM 
Jeff, I am preparing a report here for a client about foreign companies' experiences here in Turkey.  I was wondering if it would be ok for me to contact someone involved with Enron=01,s Turkey operation.  I suspect that = any such information is confidential, or at least sensitive, but if not, would be very interesitng.  Please do not hesitate to say a big loud no.  Just asking! Hope all else goes well.  We should plan on talking on the phone sometime soon, just for grins.

Johnathan, My name is Sherri Sera, and I work for Jeff Skilling.  Jeff has asked me to see if you have a completed e-mail list for Class #64, and if so, could you send it to me.  I'm assisting him in getting the group together Saturday afternoon or evening, and he would like to poll the group to see if that is something they would like to do. I appreciate your assistance in this matter. Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
Steve, thanks for the note.  It was great to meet you.  I look forward to seeing more of you in the future. Regards, 
I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling (who, by the way, has really enjoyed the old pictures being e-mailed back and forth).  He has asked me to find out what the schedule of events is for the SMU Homecoming October 27-29.  He's unable to attend any events on the evening of Saturday, October 28, as he will be at the wedding of a very good friend; however, if there are events scheduled outside of that time, he would very much like to be there. Can you provide this information or pass me on to whomever can?  Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
Benjamin, Just a short note to thank you for taking the time and effort to give me some of your ideas.  Believe it or not, we're working these exact issues right now.  Thanks very much for your input. Regards, 
Charlene, I'm sending down the letter Benjamin sent to Jeff with some ideas about improving morale in the program, which was referenced in the e-mail I 
Beek, Rocky asked me to let you know that he is really hoping to be at the party Friday evening and at the game Saturday afternoon, but he'll have to be home Saturday night for a wedding.  We'll keep you posted on how it works out, but so far it's looking like he'll be there for part (perhaps most?) of the fun. Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) 
Jeff Skilling will be there - thanks for the offer. Regards, Sherri Sera 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com ""Grover, John"" <JMGrover@dainrauscher.com> on 08/31/2000 09:15:35 AM

Ahoy, Admiral Monteleone and I have been working on the arrangements for our upcoming forum trip.  When we arrive in Nassau, both boats will be waiting for us at Atlantis.  Consistent with prior events, this trip should be outstanding.  Bill and I will present a proposed agenda on Monday night.  We welcome your input. -Blake 
Elvis, I cannot open this document either.  I wonder if you could fax it to Rocky at 713.646.8381. Thank  you, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 (fax) sherri.sera@enron.com WThom25746@aol.com on 09/12/2000 09:34:43 PM 
It appears no one can open the attachment I sent with my e-mail last night. I'll try this again. The attachment below gives the details on the Friday night party at my house. My mailing list is not complete and is not intended to exclude any Beta's, so pass the word along to all the brothers. Elvis kai - SMU Homecoming.doc
