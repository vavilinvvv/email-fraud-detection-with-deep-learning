Is it really necessary to change the book names just to avoid confusion?  Who is confused?  Can't we just inform those who need to know that the Denver books are simply another desk that rolls up into the West Region?  I don't want to be difficult, but it will require a great deal of time and effort to change every deal in the Denver books to a new name.  Let me know what you think. DG    3-9573 
Here it is.  Let me know if you have any questions. DG 
Please get this info to Jim.  Thanks. DG

Hi guys, I've just come across a few deals that are in TAGG as settling between ENA and Aquila Canada Corp.  These deals would not have shown up when you looked for deals to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as they aren't in TAGG as ECC deals.  I have a feeling that there are lots of deals like this in TAGG, but I just don't know where. We are having problems printing TAGG tickets up here, so I'm not able to see which books these deals are in right now. What I'm requesting is that you go through all your books and look for all deals with Aquila Canada Corp. that are to settle for March and April 2001, and after, and flip these deals into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  As it stands, I'm missing at least 10 deals from the April 2001 Nymex invoice, and I want to make sure that these deals don't get invoiced by someone in Houston settlements. Nymex settled yesterday for April, so invoicing for these deals is taking place today. I understand that you are all very busy right now, but it would really be appreciated if this was dealt with as soon as possible today.  The settlements group and I need to get our invoices sent out today, so we need these deals to be fixed right away. Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter, and let me know if I can assist you in any way. Thanks so much for your help Stacey- 
We added $75M so Schedule C tonight. DG

Hi guys, Here is a list of the deals that I've come across in the different books that still need to be flipped to the P& book by the end of today. FT-CENT QU4059.1 FT-NORTHWEST FT-ONTARIO FT-WEST GD-CENTRAL NG-EXOTIC QY3631.1 NG-PRICE These were the only books that I found deals to be flipped.  I was looking for all deals that are to settle during March and April 2001 with ECC.  If you find any others that I might have missed, please flip them. Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Thanks for all your help Stacey 
I will make it DG SSCHROED@us.ca-indosuez.com on 03/28/2001 10:46:28 AM 
How is this for everybody (Mike I know you can't make it) 
Wednesday Lunch 12:30 at Treebeards works for me.  If you call me before you leave, I'll walk over with you. 
I changed the deal but thought you would want to see the correct name of the CP. DG 
Done. DG 
I appologize for the delay.  I was on vacation when you sent the first request and somehow didn't see it when I was going through a week's worth of emails  .  I have a person in my group getting the information together. We'll let you know when it is complete. 
Darron, Can you please update the 04/01 price for deal # 27253 in Sitara? It currently has a rate of $2.3043 (last month's price). The customer invoiced a rate of $1.8351. Thanks, Genaro 
Darron, Could you please let me know the status on this information as soon as possible? Thanks, Mark 
I'm in for lunch. DG SSCHROED@us.ca-indosuez.com on 03/26/2001 09:50:57 AM 
How about getting together for lunch or after work this week or next? 
Hi Jeff, Could you please do me a favor, and make sure that all Canadian deals that are in Houston books are flipped to the P& book.  I don't have a current list of all the desk leads, so I thought that I'd ask you to forward this message on to them for me.  I know that the EOL group is still working on a solution to our problem, but there are still deals that are in Houston books that need to be flipped. Please let me know if there is anything I can help with.  Thanks for your help on this. Stacey

Jennifer, NGI-PGE/TOPOCK is an internal curve used to value transport and is equal to NGI-SOCAL.  This curve will probably show up every month because the West Coast is very volitile.  The change is due to a change in the market. IF-TW/PERMIAN is a production area curve.  The change is also due to  market changes that drove up the curve. Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Hi guys, I've come across this deal that needs to be flipped right away. This deal is in the MGMT-WEST book with Aquila Canada Corp. and ENA.  It needs to be in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book settling between ECC and Aquila Canada Corp.  This is causing problems with the February Liquidations as I settled this deal with Aquila, but it isn't coming through the liquidations correctly.  Please let me know when this is done so I can let Shannon McPearson know that she needs to re-run the February Liquidations. Thanks Stacey

Sean, I found out that Silver Creek is a very small resort close to the town of Granby, CO.  It is acutally 15 miles north of Winter Park and 2 miles south of Granby along Hwy 40.  We are staying at a condo there from Sunday night (11th) thru Thursday night (15th).  I indicated we would like to go to Winter Park because we have been there and it is close.  We want to ski 2 days in Silver Creek and 2 days somewhere else.  If you can make it during the week to Keystone, then yes we will go there instead of WP.  I would love to go to an Avs game, but we will probably need to be on the road by late afternoon on Sunday. Once again, we get in on Saturday (10th) about 9pm.  That's pretty late so we may or may not be able to do anything that night.  We will leave on Sunday (11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th). Then our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.  If you can get away during the week to ski, that would be awesome.  Thanks for all your hospitality.  See you soon. DG ""Sean Mayers"" <smmayers@earthlink.net> on 02/24/2001 10:17:54 AM 
Darron, The weather is great here.  In March, we receive every type of weather.  One day we could get 12 inches of snow, the next day it could be 80!  I have a pass to Keystone, Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, and A-Basin.  My pass does not include Winter Park (although I have a free lift ticket that I could use and go skiing with you.).  My pass cost $300 and I get unlimited use (I have been 23 times this year-I think I got my money worth!).  I do not know where Silvercreek is, but I will look. Do you mean Silverthorne by chance?  If there is any way to go to Keystone, it would save Tracie and I some money.  But, I understand that it is your vacation and if you go to Winter Park, let me know and price is no concern.  This is how I rank the resorts as far as skiing: 1. Vail  2. Copper  3. Keystone  4. Winter Park/Mary Jane  5. Breckenridge. I have not been to Beaver Creek, but I heard that it was awesome.  Even though I ranked WP fourth, it is still a great resort.  The runs at Keystone and Vail are long and Vail is the largest resort in USA (5300 acres compared to 2000 for Keystone!).  As far as atmosphere (night life), Vail is by far the best.  Winter Park does not have much at the ski resort as far as night life (that I recall, but I have not been there much.).  You have to go into town, which is small.  Breckenridge is good for the night as well and so is Copper, but Vail is the best (I love Vail if you have not noticed!).  Just let me know as far as plans.  We have a busy March.  On March 17, the day you leave, we have a wedding.  On Friday night, we might have to go to the rehearsal dinner, but I do not know yet.  Michelle and the kids are coming up in March also.  Maybe she can come up at the same time.  We always have a room available. I am looking forward to seeing you and Kristi.  Let me know if you guys want to do anything in Denver.  You can also go snowmobiling and snowshoeing as well. If you guys need any ski gear or accessories, let me know and I will check here for prices.  Plus, you can borrow some of my gear on the days I can't meet up with you. You guys are going to love it here.  You also need to come out in the summertime.  It is so much better.  I think my sisters and dad are coming out again for the 4th of July.  We went white water rafting last year and Kim loved it. Looking forward to seeing you. Sean

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please take care of this if you have any to be flipped.  Thanks. DG 
This is just a quick reminder for all of you to please go into all of your books and flip out all the deals that are supposed to settle with ECC and a third counterparty  to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of the day today. Nymex closes today, and we need to make sure that all the deals are booked correctly for both the Calgary and Houston offices.  This is most important for February and March 2001 deals. Please let me know if you have any questions on this. Thanks for all your help Stacey 
Chris, We are taking $100M to Schedule C tonight.  I don't know when it may be released. DG 
This deal is related to the long term transportation that was sold to Calpine, but it is correctly booked as a physical forward sale at Malin. DG Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 02/23/2001 04:33 PM 
Darron, This is the deal I phoned you about yesterday which Eric Moon put together -  should it be booked as Transportation deal instead of a Forward ? Ellen 
No I don't.  This deal is a Physical Forward.  Usually when it pertains to a transportation the trader usually creates a Transportation Capacity ticket in Sitara.  When it hits our portfolio we would then set it up in Global Contracts. Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sylvia x3-5755 Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 02/22/2001 05:21 PM 
Sylvia, I'm looking into this deal and after researching it  it seems like there should be a separate Transportation Contract for this deal, and should not be confirmed by us on the Confirmation desk. Do you know anything about this deal or Contract ? Eric Moon in Gas Structuring is the dealmaker and he asked me to talk to Darron Giron who is a book admin. This deal relates to Tagg # EC3952  -  apparently they pulled loads of different transportation deals from our books and sold it on to Calpine. It seems to me there must be a Contract out there for this 8 year deal. Ellen x54099 
Hey folks. Just a note, Calpine Energy Services, LP deal #559974 was originally attached to a GTC due to the fact that the contracts group had not yet received the master contract. The contract was received & entered into Global this week & as a result we moved the above referenced deal to the master (Global #96056886). Transaction term information: 5/1/01 - 10/31/08. Please reconfirm as necessary. Thanks all!

As part of our monthly testing, we review the monthly Natural Gas P & L Statement and identify specific regions for which we would like to review additional documentation.  Please find below, the regions that we have identified.  We are requesting that you supply the P & L top pages for the last day of the month for those regions that are applicable to you.  Once we have reviewed these top pages, we will be contacting you to discuss the drivers of these regions.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  As of February 28th, Arthur Andersen employees will no longer have access to Enron Lotus Notes.  I am asking that all correspondence please be sent to my Arthur Andersen Lotus Notes account at mark.c.austin@us.arthurandersen.com. Thank You, Mark Austin Arthur Andersen ext. 68680 
I will attend 
If you have any questions about this let me know.  It will be a pain in the ass if the deal is between Enovate and Oneok but is then flipped to EMW to manage.  There will be twice as many legs and the volumes will need to be adusted at minimum on a monthly basis, and likely a weekly basis.  Again, let me know if you need anything. DG 
We arrive in Denver on Saturday evening (the 10th).  We will stay that night and leave sometime on Sunday for Silvercreek.  We will return to Denver on Friday the 16th and stay the night.  Our plane back to Houston is early Saturday morning.  We are staying at a place in Silvercreek (I had not heard of this place before Kristi's friends made the plans) for 5 nights.  I think we want to ski there and possibly in Winter Park (it is supposed to be within 15 miles).  How's the weather in Denver these days?  We look forward to seeing the two of you.  Thanks. DG ""Sean Mayers"" <smmayers@earthlink.net> on 02/17/2001 10:21:28 AM 
Let me know again what the days are.  Also, let me know what you guys what to do.  I can get lift tickets for about $43 at the grocery store.  Talk to you later. Sean 
Sheri, We are going to NO for JazzFest at the end of April.  April 27th-29th to be exact.  Let me know if you're going. DG 
How was Cabo?  I'm sure it was great. 
I have 3 new employees and they are working on the first unit.  My 3 existing employees are working on their second and third.  So far so good.  I think it is good that we have put the responsibility on them to learn the material.  I have not heard of any negative response.  I'll keep you posted. DG Jeffrey C Gossett 02/20/2001 10:23 AM 
Any feedback?? 
This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this application more efficient.  Such as: 1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 message/second. 2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a transaction without having the screen update with new deals. 3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates very quickly. 4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, etc. and it  will filter to that section. Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated! Thanks, Dawn 
Yes DG Darla Saucier@ENRON 02/16/2001 01:53 PM 
I am working on OA for phase II Dec prod.  It looks like there are liquidations on the buy side that equal the variance on the sales side for the above ref counterparty.  Look at NW9561.2 and NX4842.2.  Is it okay to assume that these liquidations belong on the  purchase side.  This is for the west region. Call if you have questions. Thanks! 
Let me know if either of you have questions. Greg 
How goes it?  I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for March.  I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the four of us.  He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying with us.  I hope this is OK.  He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out one night.  Let me know.  Also,  I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad school.  He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.  Talk to you soon.

I just looked at their sight.  They seem like a reputable company.  It's a store in Manhattan, NY.  The only thing to be concerned about when ordering by phone or online is when there is a problem with the unit.  It is more of a pain in the ass to mail it back than to just take it to Circuit City or Best Buy.  But a Sony DVD is very reliable and you should not have a problem.  I'd pull the trigger, that's a great price. DG Mike Fultz <Mike.Fultz@HALLIBURTON.com> on 02/12/2001 03:09:08 PM 
Darron, I am ready to purchase the Sony C670D DVD Player.  I have gone thru CNET.com and found a three star (highest rating) certified CNET dealer that sells it for $340  - Tweeter has it for $449 + tax and Circuit City and Best Buy don't carry this model.  The name of the Internet company is moreaudiovideo.com. Did you order yours off the internet and if so from whom?  I am a little weary about buying something like this off the internet...

The WEST-PERM deals have been flipped. 
Jay, Give me a mutual fund to buy for the Ed IRA accounts. 
Edie, Darren, further to our conversation.  The only reporting that I would like to send upstairs is broken down into two categories.  West Gas Trading, and West Gas Origination.  All orig ( even Denver ) is coded to 107321. Inside of west gas orig we have created a tracking mechanism through Darren, that provides a seperate report broken down by individual or group but I am the only person who needs this data for right now. Edie, please ensure that on a go forward basis that the actualized income streams have been coded in the proper places and that we do not double count again. Call if any questions. BT

A husband and wife want to take golf lessons from a pro at a local country club. The man and woman meet the pro and head onto the driving range. The man goes up to hit first. He swings and hits the ball 100 yards. The golf pro says not bad. Golfpro: ""Now hold the club as firm as you hold your wife's breasts"". The man follows instructions and hits the ball 300 yards. The golf pro says ""Excellent!"" Now the woman takes her turn. Her ball goes 30 yards. Golfpro: ""Not bad, try holding the club like you hold your husbands penis."" She swings and the ball goes 10 yards. Golfpro: ""Not bad, 
How are you feeling?  I'm very tired and stiff.  I've been thinking, and I know you feel like I make all of the decisions around our house when it comes to $.  So I want us to do what you want on the pool and a car when it comes to financing.  I will completely agree with whatever you think we should do. And I'm not doing this for any other reason except that I want you to know that I value your judgement and ideas.  Have a great day.  As always, I love you very much. 
I received the item. DG Tabitha Mohon@ENRON 02/09/2001 02:50 PM 
John/Darren, We are in the process of cleaning our files and found this purchase order is still open.  Could you please check to see if you have received this item(s) and let me know so that we can get it out of the system. Thank you, Tabitha

Hi guys, Here's a spreadsheet with the list of Aquila Canada Corp. and Engage Energy Canada deals that need to be flipped right away. The book is listed on the left column.  Please let me know when these are finished as I need to get an invoice to the customers within the next couple of hours. Thanks Stacey

Troy, I'm out of the office this morning.  I'll get back to you later about the variance.  But just so you know, Kevin's reported P&L was understated by the $188K on the OA Flash tab.  He made an error in the sharing calculation.

Prior to her trip to Texas, Buffy (a New Yorker) confided to her sorority sisters she had three goals for her trip to the Lone Star State. She wanted to taste some real Texas Bar B Que, take in a bona fide rodeo and have sex with a cowboy.  Upon her return, her sorority sisters were curious as to how she fared. Let me tell you, they have a tree down there called mesquite and when  they slow cook that brisket over that mesquite, oh so good!!!! The taste is unbelievable!!!  I went to a real rodeo. Talk about athletes, these guys wrestle  real full-grown bulls- like in Spain.  Except they ride a horse out at full gallop, then jump off the horses and literally grab the bulls by the horns  and throw them to the ground.  It is incredible! 
Jay, I changed the FTS monthly amount from $1,065 to $715 as previously discussed.  It is effective Feb 20th.  I need to change the amount transferred to account  586-61L86 from $150 to $175 and to account 586-61M19 from $175 to $200.  I also submitted a transfer of $1,000 into my CMA account.  I would like to transfer $500 each into account 586-94017 and account 586-94019.  This is my 2001 contribution to the Education IRA's.  Let me know if I need to do anything else.  Also, when are the recharacterizations from Roth to Traditional going to take place?  I will need a 1099-R for the transactions I think.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather was good and the food was great.  How is DC?

Guess who was at JV yesterday?  aTm coaches.  Seems like we have been losing some players lately.  How do we stand? 
Greg, I got confirmation from the Head Coach at JV that AR is not going to UT. He scored a 760 on his SAT and apparently overslept a retake exam.  So I don't know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.  Either way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.  The coach is really dissapointed in AR. 
Lunch next week

Hey Darron, just been working on year-end stuff here.  Too many late nights.  I have been keeping up with recruiting.  The guy from Jersey Village is Abe Robinson, a  O-lineman, TE prospect.  He will probably play offenseive tackle (6'5"" -260 - 4.9) and is a top 10-15 prospect in the state.  Texas will have a top 5 recruiting class but the problem is that OU will possible have the top 1 or 2 class and have signed the top defensive player in Texas, Tommie Harris.   A&M is the odd man out in the mix because of the emergence of OU and LSU.   A&M is going back to pre-Sherrill days. I would think they will be looking for a new coach next year. Let's try to get together soon.  Maybe have lunch or something. Talk to you soon 
Hey, What's going on?  I wanted to get up to date on recruiting.  I also wanted to ask you something.  I heard some info from my wife regarding a kid that was recruited and commited to UT from Jersey Village. DG

These all need to be flipped to settle in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS books like the rest of these deals.  I've spoken to Jennifer Denny with EOL about getting a program set up for Duke deals similar to ones we have with TransCanada Energy and Dynegy Canada so they automatically get booked to settle with ECC, but I don't think this has happened yet.  Please go through your books to make sure that no Duke deals have been missed. Please let me know if you have any questions on this. Thanks for all your help Stacey

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is required between the Org region code used in Portcalc for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that region. An example would be similar to: Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code CENTRAGULF FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be a valid grouping TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical region codes that are related to it. Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and what Tagg Book it would relate to. If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers. Any questions or concerns, please call me. Thanks Russ x37386 
Please read. DG 
We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.

Mike, DVD time huh?  I like my player, but there is a substantial premium for it. And actually, Sony has come out with the next evolution of the mega DVD changer.  I think it lists for $900, but can probably be had for $600-$700 range.  It is also huge.  I'm not trying to talk you out of it, just let you know of the downside.  Both models have identical specs, so quality is not an issue.  Let me know if you have anymore questions. DG Mike Fultz <Mike.Fultz@HALLIBURTON.com> on 01/15/2001 10:14:40 AM 
Darron, What is going on??  Not much here...same old same old.  How is the Mustang running?  Looks like I will be getting rid of the TA within the next month or two.  I have been looking pretty hard at Tahoe's and finally have a firm price to work with.  Anyway, it is about time to get my DVD player and I was wondering if you are happy with your 200 disc DVD Player.  I can get it off the internet for ~$400 or I can get Scott's for ~$275.  Sony has released their next generation of DVD  - I think the 'S' series.  There is one that is designed to match the Wega tv's.  It is a single disc and costs about $330 on the internet.  I am not exactly sure what the differences between the new 'S' series and the 'C' series are.  I don't know if I should get the new one and pay the extra money or just get an older model.

Could you please let me have a signed original copy of your review.  Thanks. 
Make sure your group is looking out for this. 1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off 2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of seeing this. Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have questions concerning TDS systems call Bill Fortney x39952, or you can talk to Russ Severson. Thanks, Bill 
Done.  Sorry it took so long. DG Tricia Truong 01/18/2001 02:27 PM

I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily report with all originated deals. He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help. 
Here is a list by group of suggested improvements for OA.  I will arrange a meeting to discuss how we can implement these quickly.

OK, NG5405.1 instead of NG5401.1 NW7984.1 instead of E22563.6

What is basis? What is MTM value? What is Accrual value? What do you consider stress in the workplace?  How do you handle stress? Examples of a stressful situation?

My employee in question fell out in ""Needs Improvement"" because of the lack of time in her position. DG    3-9573 Francisco deJesus@ENRON 12/21/2000 04:35 PM 
You have 1 employee who fell out in  ""Needs Improvement"" at the year end 2000 PRC process. I would like to meet with you to address the employee's areas of improvement.  Additionally, I will be sitting in on your discussion with the employee. My role will be twofold: assist you in creating a communication and development plan for the employee to serve as an advocate for the employee and management As agreed, We will not be sitting in with employees who were placed in ""Needs Improvement"" due to newest in position. Specifically, employees who are meeting your learning curve expectations but because of their newest and limited contributions they were placed in ""Needs Improvement"". You should plan to discuss your development plan with your employee(s) between now and January 31, 2001. Please contact me prior to meeting with the employee so I can assist with your plans. Call if you have any questions, I can be reached on (713) 345-3662. 
Jim, I didn't top level that amount tonight.  The Central desk has the other side of the transaction and if I backed your portion out, then the loss would be double counted.  It will correct itself tomorrow. DG 
Happy Holidays!  It looks like we will be going skiing in Colorado from March 11-16.  I wanted to see if you were going to be in town during that time and see if we could come by and see you.  It would most likely be on the 10th and then the 16th.  We are staying at a place from that Sunday night thru Thursday night.  Let me know.  I hope Santa was good to you all.

I just wanted to pass along my thanks for the efforts of your team.  The automatic bridge to Sitara and Tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of time; especially during bidweek.  I know there are others who deserve thanks in addition to Dawn, so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as well.  I don't want to seem greedy, but I'll ask anyway.  When do you think we will be able to get the Sitara number entered in the Link field in Tagg? Also, can we get the Tagg number entered in SCI?  Thanks again. DG    3-9573 
Dawn:  Thank you so much for all of your hard work in getting these physical products to bridge correctly.  You have saved us a tremendous amount of work.  I know that there were a ton of little details that went into getting these products done correctly.  Everything went smoothly, and the bridge worked the first time.  We really appreciate your efforts. Thanks Dawn C Kenne@ECT 12/21/2000 11:02 AM 
FIXED...you will never have that problem again!!!! Keep letting me know! Dawn

Please make sure that all physical deals with a finacial component are marked physical in TAGG.  Mostly this applies to annuities associated with physical deals and imbedded options.   Not clicking physical is causing problems with accounting as well as the credit group. Thanks 
Please read. DG 
Dawn, The deals look good in both Tagg and Sitara, but the link field in Tagg has not been populated with the Sitara number.  When will this be ready?  Thanks. DG    3-9573 Dawn C Kenne 12/19/2000 02:28 PM 
Darron, Please take a look at these deals in Tagg Stage and Sitara parallel.  Look at the pricing, risk book assignments, and the hedges in sitara (if needed). Let me know if there is a problem.

I watched the second half.  He is a stud.  Westlake actually had a good defense also.  I think he wast the first back to run for 100 yds.  We know some people from Midland.

I just would not want to be the only person to bring someone.  So if we don't offer this to everyone, I won't bring her.  I don't have a problem with it, just wanted to see what you thought. DG Enron North America Corp. 
I want to run something by you.  It sounds like we have some sort of budget for Friday night.  I would like to offer everyone the opportunity to bring someone with them but also explain that we may not be able to pay for it all.  I guess the reason is I would like to have Kristi come with me, but am willing to pay for her.  I would like to do the same for everyone else, but don't want to offend anyone with the possibility that they may have to pay a little $$.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

When Gas Daily curves are created in ERMS, the rate server group has told me that the GDP designated curves should be those that are actually  published, that they can get an outside feed to pull in the rates. Internally created curves used for gas daily purposes should be designated as a GDC curve.  If curves created in the future could follow this naming convention it would make the curve names more meaningful. Normal GDP curves need to be set up by the global rate server group, dummy internal curves can be set up in global by us. Any questions, please give me a call. Thanks Russ x37386

Pretty nice.  I had never even heard of this vehicle. DG Greg Couch 12/12/2000 01:56 PM 
Found this on a web site. The Gelaendewagen or ""G-wagen"" is something of a Land Rover on steroids with German engineering. Think of a cross between an S500 sedan and the Hummer. At $135,000 a copy and with only a handful being imported into the US, those lucky enough to get their hands on a G-Wagen are assured exclusivity and an all-terrain vehicle that means business. 
Please read.  Thanks. DG 
Please forward this to your groups. Thanks.

Hi Darron, Here's another deal that needs to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book A.S.A.P. Q90614.1 Thanks Stacey 
Hi Darron, I'm not sure if this message is to go to you, and if it needs to go to someone else could you please forward it to them, but there are several deals in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book in the morning.

Could you please make sure that there aren't any more deals with ECC and a third counterparty in this book as it messes up invoicing and settlement. Please call me if you have any questions on this.

Please let me know how I can get on a list to talk with potential candidates.  I am ignorant of the process, so if I am presuming something incorrect, I would appreciate info on how this is supposed to work.  Thanks for your help. DG    3-9573

First of all, congrats on the big win this weekend.  They keep proving me wrong.  Second, sorry this is late.  Friday was 1st day, our longest of the month. DRAFT This is a summary of where we stand from a Risk Management perspective on the PGT/Socal permanent assignment to Calpine  Currently there are 5 deals in Tagg and 1 in the transport  model. EC3952.O - Annuity where the West desk pays PGT (from $.08987 to $.17308) on 67,500/Day thru Oct-23 This deal will be unwound and this income (approx $30M) will fall out in the West desk EC3952.F - Buy from Canada of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00 EC3952.K - Sell to AEC of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00 As of now, these deals will remain unchanged in the system because AEC will not let us out of the firm contract EC2208.B - Buy from Canada of 22,500/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index - $.005 EC3952.B - Buy from Canada of 15,000/Day thru Oct-01 at Malin for Index - $.01 These deals will be unwound, but discussions between Philip Allen and ??? will reveal details not known at this point in time   (Bid/Offer) Transport Model - Kingsgate to Malin capacity of 67,500/Day beginning Nov-08 thru Oct-23 This deal will have to be unwound or killed - Currently the deal is valued at approx $12M in the West Desk After unwinding these deals, the West desk will be kept whole, the remainder will be granted out in orig. This is my first go at it.  Let me know of any revisions you want. 
You're welcome.  I had a good time also.  We should play again sometime when it's not so damn cold.  Looks like you were right about OU.  I really thought they would lose to KState. DG Jackson Logan 12/04/2000 08:56 AM

I was informed by the Sitara team that there are still sitara deals duplicated from yesterday's bridging ""issues"".  I have them highlighted in red in the e-mail below. Please kill the duplicate sitara number as soon as possible.  I believe atleast one of them is for gas flowing tomorrow!  If you need further information or assistance, contact me at 3-9353. Thanks, Dawn 
Due to the sitara bridge failing earlier today, it looks as though 7 sitara deals got double booked..  Listed in the e-mail below you will find the EOL # and the correponding Sitara #'s.  Please review and kill the sitara deal that is not ""linked"" to the EOL #. If you need further assistance, call me at 3-9353. Sorry for any inconvenience.  Happy Bidweek!!!!! Dawn

I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was going to be free on Saturday.  My brother-in-law is hosting a tournament on Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill. In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He will have a keg.  There will be prizes for the winners.  It is a four man best ball scramble.  Tee time is early:  7:30am.  I sent this to guys I either know play or think play.  If you have someone else in mind, feel free to forward the message.  I don't have a team at all and wanted to see if anyone was interested.  Let me know. DG    3-9573 
I told her we would go. D 
Gary and I are going to have a ""get together"" before the Holiday Party on Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in the ""burbs""!   (No names mentioned). Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions to our place.  Hope all of you can make it! Thanks, Dawn 3-9353

Hi Darron, There's a deal in the FT-West book that needs to be moved to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book right away. Q90611.1 Please let me know if you have any questions on this. Thanks Stacey 
A GC for either $ or for one of those Day Spas. 
Hi Darron, Please move these deals to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of tomorrow. Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Also, please make sure that there aren't any deals between ECC and a third counterparty in any of your books.  If there are, could you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book. Thanks Stacey 
I hope you have a good day back at school.  I love you.

I'll try and find out today. D DMoore2651@aol.com on 11/22/2000 04:53:01 AM 
Any chance of you knowing the phone number of the place where Kristi gets her nails done?  I want to give her gift certificates from there for Christmas. Clark sent me about 24 pictures of your visit...In one, Carley and Erin look like sisters. 
Russell, These are all of our book names: GD-NEW GD-NEWJR FT-WEST FT-NORTHWEST MGMT-WEST WEST-NW WEST-SW WEST-PERM WEST-SJ For Basis, add  -BAS to the end of the book name.  For Gas Daily, add  -GDL to the end of the book name.  Call me if you have any questions. 
Russ, I got this from Regina just before she changed groups. DG    3-9573 
Uncle Clark, It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be. 
Done.  I did the 1999 changes as well. DG    3-9573 
I asked Keith Holst (trader) again.  His answer was the same.  There were more buyers than sellers in the West during March, hence the price was stronger.  Thanks. DG 
Darron -- Thanks for your response.  We understand that the west traded higher in general during March v. Feb,  as evidenced by the data.  However, we are looking for specific reasons as to why this is so.  For example, if the market was more volatile at these locations, then why?  What particular market conditions sparked large price changes, etc?  Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Jennifer 
Jennifer, The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further questions. DG 
Russell, Here are our portfolio and book codes: Port Book 1 Q G G E # L A 4 5 P A Call me if you have any questions. 
Kathy, I tried calling but could not get you or your voicemail.  Tomorrow is the first day of bidweek and I also have some other meetings to attend.  I think we need to skip this week and pick up next Tuesday.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

P&L is OK.  Open position is 39.0 contracts. DG Chris Abel 11/17/2000 05:17 PM 
In addition:  expert clauses - which ones need to be changed, when and why - what are reversals and why we use them - how to check physical prompt month value for potential errors - how to calculate physical prompt month value - checking the OA Flash tab.  I am sure there are some others. DG 
Daniel, I show a net open position of (15.9) contracts. 
I relpied to mom already, but thought you would want to see it. D 
Will be sending you info about a first cousin's reunion set for next sept near Denver.  Barry's family had already planned a family vacation there and I think Sean and Kim convinced them that this would be a good time for all 9 of you to try to get together. Barry already has reservations at two condos there so will xerox Erva's letter.  I am willing to foot the bill for the condos. MOM 
Sorry.  I just did. 
We would love to do this. D Darnellmo@aol.com on 11/15/2000 04:49:06 PM

A W4 calculates how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck each pay period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There is really no right or wrong answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on April 15th, then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately.  If you don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and married and jointly.  I hope that made sense.

Darron, Can you answer this tax question for Lelie? Scott 
11/14/2000 02:02 PM Hey Scott T -  I was just up on 19 funny knowing you're right above me. They just sent me down a new W4 to fill out - do you know if its better to file married and jointly or married and separately? How do I find out. You know Mr. Scharck doesnt have a clue and Im not really sure either. Thanks for the idea about the DVD player - thats what he is getting and Mike told me to get The Patriot, Matrix and Fight Club - Big George is driving up with Drew, Chris Melber, Ross etc on Friday and he is going to take it for me - so you don't have to mess with it.

Eric, I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal. She ran the transport book at that time. The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed. I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.

I was going to last night, but it didn't sound like you wanted to talk.  We had a great time.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.  It was cold but the game was fun.  It was good to see the kids getting along as well as they did.  We will try and make it a regular trip.  We also spoke about maybe getting together in Dallas sometime next year.  I need to go, but will talk to you later. D Darnellmo@aol.com on 11/14/2000 10:30:17 PM 
I had rather hoped you would share a few words about the Kansas trip with me.

THE CLASSIC VERSION - The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. THE MODERN VERSION - The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. ""America"" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries 
Here is another one.  It will be another Chicago book.  We will never officialize the book.  Thanks. DG    3-9573

OK, so the classes start this week.  The first one will be on what to look for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout is as follows: Group1   Group2 Carole    Jennifer Jason    Anne Chris Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks. 
Frank, Attached is my PBA nomination for Anne Bike.  Let me know if I left anything out, or need to do anything else.  Thanks, DG 
Connie, I believe I misinterpreted your request.  I have updated the list to include every book we officialize each night. DG    3-9573 
Connie, I appologize for the tardiness of this list.  I was out of the office last Thursday and Friday.  Please call if you have any questions. DG    3-9573

Don't worry about picking us up at the airport.  I will be careful and brave the elements.  See you tomorrow. 
Well, I win the award for ass of the week and probably the year.  I really can't begin to apologize enough for Tuesday.  I won't offer an excuse.  Guys on the Central desk asked me a question as soon as I hung up with you, and before I knew it, it was around 2:30pm.  But the worst part is, I didn't realize what I had done until later the next day.  It was disrespectful and I sincerely apologize.  I do have a conflict tomorrow.  And I will understand if you want to stop the sessions.  Thanks.

Hello, Young People..... ? Still planning on the KU/UT game next weekend, I  hope.? If you are flying in, you can get?from the airport, about 30-35  miles, without hitting a traffic light until the last mile or so. ? FROM THE AIRPORT: 1.? Exit the airport toward Kansas City on  I-29 South.? When you get to 2.??I-635, go South; probably will be  marked to ""Wichita"" or maybe Kansas City.? When you get to 3.??I-35, go South again.? You will  be somewhere around 50th street.? Street numbers increase as you go  south. 4.? After 75th Street stay in the right lane  and take Hiway 69 South. 5.? Stay on Hiway 69; after 119th Street it  will curve left and then right.? After the right hand curve, the road  merges with another highway.? Stay in the extreme right lane  and 6.? Exit at 135th street.? Exit to the  right and stay in the right lane until the first light; (Antioch).? (About  half mile). 7.? Turn right at Antioch (first light) and  get into the left lane. 8.? Short block to the first light; this is  133rd Street; turn left. 9.? Go to the second right; this is  Kessler.? Turn right on Kessler. 10.? Take the immediate left onto 132nd  Place.? Go to second house on right; not counting the house on the  corner.? The address is 9210. ? After you leave the airport, the exits onto I-29  and then onto I-35 come a little quickly, so watch for the signs.?  I expect to be home all weekend.? But, if I  am out, the garage door keypad combination is ""0730"".? Make yourselves at  home and help yourselves to anything that is not tied or nailed down or  hazardous.? My phone number is (913) 402-9210; cell phone is (913)  269-6247.? Not necessary to dial the area code once you get into Kansas.? From the airport (Missouri) you'll need the area  code. ? If you're driving, exit I-35 in Olathe at Exit  215.? Turn right and go about 4.5 miles to Switzer (school on left; park on  right).? Left on Switzer to first right (133rd Street).? Right on  133rd to second left (Kessler).? Left on Kessler; left on 132nd Place to  house.? Let me know when you expect to arrive and then depart and maybe we  can line something up to keep you busy while you're here.? Sean and Tracie  will be in San Antonio that weekend, and Mike and Christine can't make it, but  Michelle and her gang and Kim are anxious to see you again.? See you  soon......Clark. 
Darron, For Oct 2000 I found a Liquidation amount in the Central region for The Peoples Gas Light & Coke......$336,234.06 Yet, I show no transactions for them in that region.  I looked in tagg - deal capture and for the tagg numbers listed in the detail OA-liquidation spreadsheet (N17872.1   N17872.2   N18064.1 N18064.2), I either saw no ""comments"", or there was a comment referring to a ""North Shore Baseload sale"".

I can't believe it is already time for our trip up to Kansas.  We are arriving on Thursday morning and returning on Sunday morning.  Other than the game on Saturday, we don't have any plans.  See you soon. 
The kids and I are arriving at 9:45am on Thursday.  Because of work commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.  The 3 of us will get a rental car and make our way to your place.  Are you going to be home then?  Then we will go pick up Kristi later.  We have no plans at the moment (other than going to the game on Saturday).  We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time, though, 6:30am.  They didn't give me many options using reward travel.  We are all looking forward to the trip.  See you on Thursday. 
Kristi said you called on Saturday.  I was golfing.  What did you think about the draft?  I thought LD was a good college player, but not great.  Everyone seems to think he will be an All-Pro type player before he's done.  As long as he works hard, I think SR would make the best Pro.  But what do I know? 
Jeremy, I can calc postids for FT-NW but cannot print.  Please help.  Thanks. 
Sharon, I missplaced the info we were speaking about yesterday.  Please send it to me again so I can follow up.  Thanks.

Because me and the kids are using reward miles for our tickets, right now Kristi is not on the same flight that the three of us are on.  We are all looking forward to seeing you. 
Hope the language does not offend anyone! Dawn

Jeremy, I don't have access to run this book.  Will you please get me authorization? Thanks. 
Let's make sure we are doing this every night.  I think Jason has been running the official post id macro most nights, but we need to have the last person finished do it every day.  I sure can crank out the emails when I get some uninterrupted time to myself! DG 
I am in Chicago today and tomorrow.  I will look at this more while I am here. 
I can't remember if I forwarded this to you already.  Thanks. DG 
Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when they can start invoicing as well. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter. Thank you Stacey 
Will you two please get this info to Dutch.  Thanks. DG 
How was your morning?  I hope not too bad.  I didn't get to sleep until 3am. I miss you and love you. D

What time are you arriving on Friday?  We got box seats to the Bears game on Sunday. 
Kathy, I don't think I will be able to make our meeting tomorrow.  Can we pick it up again next week?  Thanks. 
I think it will be a very close game.  Except for the fart against Colorado, you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.  OU is obviously a very good team.  But I think more importantly, they are just playing great football.  They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.  When the QB heaves a pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, the football Gods are smiling on you big time.  But regardless, you've got to admire Stoops and the job he has done.  They have proven for three consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best defenses in the country. And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above average team.  They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance. They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best team in the country) good team they have played.  And lost to a bad Stanford team.  But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may result in a T+1 win.  But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team. But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU. They are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition. DG greg_carrow@valic.com on 10/30/2000 10:46:29 AM 
Don't think  I'm crazy, but I think the Aggies will beat OU (man I would hate that, we would never hear the end of it).  Crazy things happen in College Station,  I wish I were out of the country on that day.   Right now, the Aggies look like they could beat us.  We better get our shit together.  What are your thoughts?  Again, I hope I'm wrong but the Aggies worry me. Later 
Here's what happened. 
This deal was EOL ID 520766 on the 25th.  Neither the Sitara or EOL number is in Tagg.  Please update the deal with the EOL and Sitara number.  It is very important that you always put this information in Tagg.  In addition, make sure you are updating Sitara with the Tagg numbers as well.  Thanks. 
Yes 
Stacey - Darron is controller for the west region,  and he should be able to take care of this and point you in the right direction for future issues. Thanks 
Hi Jeff, I'm hoping you're the person who takes care of this book.  If not, could you please forward this message to the appropriate person.  There are a few deals in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be moved to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS BOOK.  These are all EnronOnline deals so they were put into this book automatically. Q24809.1 Q47957.1 Q50596.1 Could you please tell everyone down there that books deals into Houston books, to make sure that there aren't any ECC deals with counterparties in these books.  Nymex closes today, and I'm going to have to start invoicing on Monday, so I need to have all deals with ECC in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of today. Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter. Thanks for your help Stacey 
????????? 
Hi Jeff, Just to let you know that there are a few deals that need to be moved to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book before the end of Thursday this week, as they need to be invoiced from the Canada office. Please let me know if you have any questions on this. Thanks so much for your help. Stacey (403)974-6787 
I thought you might like this.  Do you have a ticket to Chicago yet?  I don't think Jenny will have any luck getting hired in Risk.

I think she should get a call from them.  How's life in Dallas?  Also, what is your new cell number.  The Houston Cellular number no longer works. DG

What do you think about us starting to workout together regularly?  Either at night or in the mornings, but regularly and for the long term.  Maybe four times a week.  Running and some weights in the garage.  I would really like to start, even as hard as it will be, to make time for something like this. I love you. 
Here it is...you gonna split the money with me right??

During the August settlement period, we discovered at least 4 book codes that had just recently started containing financial, third-party deals in them. We tried to put a procedure into place where we were calling the risk guys to find out about new books.  I don't know, however, if we are calling the right people because we were not told about the 4 books that we discovered on our own. From now on, I am going to have Beatrice Reyna from my group call someone from Reporting (Frank) and key people in Risk before we run our NYMEX invoices at the end of the month.  Will, can you please send me a list of people that Bea should contact that would know what we are talking about? Even if the book codes are not brand new, but if they have just started putting financial deals in them, WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM. Thanks you so much for your help, Becky 
This book is for the West desk.  Please call if you have any questions. 
This is pretty funny.

I think Sitara deal 286147 is not pulling the correct price in Unify.  The reference price is NWPL.RKYMTNS.GDP.DA and the particular month in question is 06/00.  When I look in the Tables database under June, there is no price. And what was pulled for the invoice back in June I don't think is correct. Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks. 
My apologies to you left-wingers who may receive this e-mail... While Al Gore  has a habit of exaggerating his record, these numbers tell us the real truth  about his record on education, healthcare and taxes: AL GORE'S  EDUCATION PLANS... $10,000...? tax deduction that Al Gore says will  be received by ""all students who want to go to college"". $800... tax  deduction is the reality. 0... students working their way through college  getting a tax credit because they do not pay enough in income  taxes. 30,000,000... low-income households get no benefit on Gore's  education plan. 0...? families making over $20,000 get a  benefit. 5,000,000... upper income families are ineligible. 0...  deductions or credits for room, board, books, supplies, and travel. 1...  education plan that is almost identical to the one that failed in the Clinton  White House. AL GORE'S PROGRAM ON HEALTHCARE: $600... access  fee per year to obtain prescription drug coverage under the Gore  plan. 412... new regulatory mandates created by the Gore Medicare  plan. 182... new regulations dealing with prescription drugs  alone. 64.5... the age you are when you have your one and only  opportunity to buy into a government HMO. 8... year wait for Gore's plan  to be implemented. 2... times the price of Bush's plan to create more  government bureaucrats THE VICE PRESIDENT ON TAXES: 88...  separate tax increases along with 42 new user fees Gore proposed in the 2001  budget. 11%... how much the tax burden has increased over the last 8  years. $500... per child tax credit was never included in previous  Clinton/Gore budgets. 50,000,000... taxpayers will not get tax relief  under Gore's plan. $1,400... couples will pay in taxes because Gore  opposed the Marriage Penalty tax cut. 4.3 cents...? tax increase on  a gallon of gas because of Gore's tie-breaking vote. THE MOST  IMPORTANT NUMBERS: 17... days until the election. PLEASE PASS THIS  ON TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS! Sincerely, Jim  Nicholson Chairman Republican National Committee P.S.??

Doug, The Sitara numbers for both of these deals are in the comments section of each deal in Tagg.  Do you have access to Tagg Deal Capture?  The Sitara numbers are 344737 (NS3520) and 344952&343785 (NS4159).  If you don't know where to look for these, let me know.  They were both available in the systems.

As you know I am moving to Global Products Risk Management soon.  As part of my delegation of duties I will be passing the TDS security on to the Enron Security group and your groups. Currently I get all SRRS requests to approve     - This is what I need someone from your group to do. Then I setup the user in TDS with the correct Book access  - This is what security will do. I would like a primary & secondary individual to be set up for approving SRRS request from each desk.  If you do not provide me with 2 names - you will be listed as the primary. My initial meeting with Security is tomorrow morning. Bill x5-7579 
Jeff, I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is easier said than done. 
I will be there.  Thanks. 
The macro in this file will query all official books for given Portfolio and Book codes.  Use it to make sure all your postid's that need to be, are officialized each night.  Thanks. DG

I would like each of your book admins using WeaponX to begin using the following procedures at least once/week (if they aren't already). Open the database while holding down on the shift key.  This will open the database, but prevent the main form from opening automatically.  Next, the admin should go to Access menu selections and choose Tools/Database Utilities/Compact Database.  After the database has completed compacting, you can use the database as normal. Just a quick explanation: This is standard procedure for Access databases.  WeaponX imports and deletes a lot of data on a daily basis.  When data is deleted, the space is not freed up that was used by the data.  Therefore, as time goes by, the database size grows and grows and needs to be periodically compacted. The Texas WeaponX file that I compacted reduced from 520 MB to 30 MB and one for the west went from 400 MB to 12 MB.  You can see that we will save several GB if everyone begins compacting the databases on a regular basis. Please note:  Even though this is standard Access procedure, I would recommend that the book admin save a copy of their existing WeaponX file prior to compacting for the first time.  Once the file is compacted and a daily run has been successful, they can delete the backup file.  It is not necessary for them to save a backup copy each time before compacting.  I am only recommending it for the first compact. I don't anticipate any problems with this procedure.  As a matter of fact, Crystal (East desk I believe) already compacts the database on a daily basis.  In addition Ann (West desk) ran a test for me with no problems. Please let me know if you have any questions. Greg 
Please make sure we stay off the ""list"".  Thanks. DG 
Mike, We are currently looking into a query which will allow us to see all of our officialized books each night.  It is not ready now, but should be soon. I'll let you know. 
Kevin, Please remember to link up all deals.  By this, I mean Tagg numbers in Sitara, Sitara numbers in Tagg, Tagg numbers in SCI, and especially EOL numbers in Tagg.  I just got a call about the park & loan on Friday.  You need to put EOL as the system of origin and the EOL number.  Thanks. 
It should reference the EOL number.  It looks af if Kevin did not link it up.  I'll remind him. DG Dawn C Kenne 10/17/2000 09:08 AM 
Darron, When you are manually entering the EMW deals into tagg, are you referencing the EOL number? I was looking at the tagg deal you gave me last Friday (Q40121) and it does not reference it.  Should it?  Or, because it is funky, does it not have to? Dawn 
Scott, These places carry the Onkyo receiver.  I don't think they carry Polk, but ask them who you should call for Polk speakers.

Mike, The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is that the postid in question did not have a net position.  The procedure Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports we run using Excel queries.  If a postid has a net position and is not officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.  It will not, however, if the postid does not have a position.  I understand the importance of officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.  Thanks. DG    3-9573

I have decided to revive the risk brown bag training sessions. I need, from each of you, a list of the topics you would like to see covered.  I would like to see topics ranging from the most basic, up - whatever you feel is necessary for your group.  Please provide these to me no later than 04/18.  Feel free to offer anything.  Think about the concepts in the training modules while you are compiling your lists. Once I have the topics, I will work with you to arrange a logical order to cover them in.  After that  Irena and I will set up a calendar, with approximately one session per month.  I am targeting mid-May for the first session. The format of each session is up to the presenter, but a couple of suggestions are: a short presentation followed by Q&A, or an open forum. Each session will be led by one of you, a suitable substitute, Jeff, or I, depending on the topic.  I will schedule, with your input and cooperation, who will present each topic. I am also sending this note to John and Russ. John, I ask that you think about OA concepts that you feel will benefit the risk group, help our personnel work better with your group, and help us understand your duties better.  I would like for you to present at least a couple of topics to us. Russ, if you think there are Sitara issues that would benefit the group, please let me know. I am open to whether these sessions are mandatory or not.  My feeling is that some should be and others (the ones of a more basic nature) should only be mandatory for those people you feel need that month's subject matter.  Let me know your opinion on this. With a small investment of your time, I believe this will be an excellent vehicle to get (and keep) topics of interest and training in front of your people. I look forward to receiving your lists.  Let me know if you have any questions. Greg 
Are we still on?  Where do you want to go?  I was thinking Mexican, but let me know what you think.

Mike, How goes it?  I was thinking about you guys this weekend.  We were in town for the game (if you want to call it a game).  We ended up staying at a friends place.  I think that is the first time in quite a while we haven't seen you on this particular weekend.  We are still plugging along.  How about you?  I thought I heard you were buying a new house.  Is that right?  Well, I just hadn't talked to you in a while and I saw you email address on a message from Sean.  We are going up to KU for the Texas game again.  I can't believe it has been 4 years since we were up there.  Take care. 
I'm with you.  I told my wife I thought it would be a 3 touchdown game, but a 49 point margin is unacceptable.  I was at the game and it was as if the Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff.  They were out of position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play.  I like Brown and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to coach.  I lay this all at his feet.  Obviously the coordinators bear some major responsibility as well.  I really don't know what to expect for the remainder of the season.  They obviously are not as bad as they showed on Saturday.  But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could be humiliated.  I was very wrong.  Something has to change.  The fact is they are 3-5 in the last 8 games.  And were favored in all but one.  Lack of talent is no longer an excuse.  I think the entire remainder of the season hinges on this Saturday.  If they play as poorly as they have all season (they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado, they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of the question.  For this reason, I think that this could be the biggest game 
It looks like we need to be consistent in booking the GD spread deals.  Take a look at the example and please remember to book all future deals in a similar manner.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. DG

Don't worry about it.  If you can't go, you can't go.  You are not going to pay for the tickets if you don't use them.  Hope you feel better. DG Jackson Logan 09/28/2000 08:34 PM 
Darron, Thank you for the directions and the tickets.  Unfortunately, I have not been feeling well and I may not end up going.  However, I should know more by tommarrow.  If someone else can use the tickets then by all mean let them use them.  If no one uses the tickets, then I will cover the cost of the tickets since you were saving them for me.  I still really want to go and maybe after another nights rest I might feel better, so I will give you a call in the morning. Thanks again. Adios, JDLIII

7-31-00 Trying to wrap up as much as I can before my last day on Friday.  Have you had a chance to look into this? Kevin 
7-31-00 This is the detail for the invoice I mentioned in my voice mail to you.  I need to get the Sitara number if this has been set up so I can pay Peoples. Thanks, Kevin x3-0560 
7-31-00 Kevin, Doing some more month end clean up. I received an invoice from Peoples Gas to ENA for $5,000.  The description is: For Summer-Winter Exchange Agreement between Peoples and ENA from June 1,2000 through July 31,200 for 1Bcf. 1 Bcf Program Original Hedge:  1,000,000 MMBtu x .005 = $5,000 I cannot find a Sitara deal for this amount.  Will you please look into this?  They told me the deal maker is Richard Tomaski. If you send me your fax number I'll send you a copy of the invoice. Thanks, Kevin 
OK, so I really screwed up.  I was getting the tickets out last night so I wouldn't forget them this morning and remembered that I am going to the airport, not the office.  So I'll call you when I get in later this afternoon.  I thought about FedEx, but don't want to take the chance that they get lost in the Enron building.  I hope you travel via 290 to Austin because I think the easiest solution is for me to leave them at my house and you could pick them up on you way out.  I also have a couple of EndZone passes with the tickets.  Sorry for the screw-up.  I'll talk to you this afternoon. 
Call me if you have any further questions. DG    3-9573 
We have the NXAVC settle for Aug at $31.138.  So just pay the lesser of. DG    3-9573 Genaro Mendoza@ENRON 09/21/2000 09:30 AM 
Thanks. I want to let you know that ENA's price is now $.1148 higher than what Agave invoiced for 08/00. I have paid at the invoiced price, since it is less. The difference in the price is in the value for Crude Merc. Your spreadsheet has $31.138 and they show $29.965. Genaro

Inside UT Football appears every Thursday.=20  =20 E-mail questions to Chip: chipbrown@dallasnews.com=20   =20 Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnews.com's Colleges site=20    CHIP SHOTS=20 =20  Every year since 1983, Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g= ames=20 of the season. That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa= st=20 17 years - usually before Texas-OU weekend. =20   Orangebloods spend winter, spring and summer discussing the impact of n= ew=20 recruits, the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning= =20 starters. They spend money on season tickets, airplane tickets and alumni= =20 luncheon tickets. They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hope= s=20 have usually come crashing down.=20   Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985= and=20 1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or= =20 losses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four= =20 losses. =20   In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2= -1=20 run in 1995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,= =20 respectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the=20 Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20  =20   Longhorn Q & A=20  Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l= ast=20 season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There = is=20 also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th= e=20 best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20 offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving= =20 us. =20  In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b= est=20 athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience= d=20 players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the= =20 ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta= rt=20 Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and= =20 play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a= nd=20 Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20 through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people= =20 miss in the open field.=20  I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter= back.=20 Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and= =20 probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc= e=20 to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if= =20 we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20 slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20  ?? The Jackson residence=20   BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out= -=20 change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli= ng=20 this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to= o=20 much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to= =20 this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some= =20 resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all= =20 the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and= =20 Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th= en=20 lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,= =20 Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's= =20 opponent, Houston.=20  That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread = was=20 that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its= =20 loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv= e=20 to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20 could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha= rd=20 team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor= ns=20 are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to= =20 his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b= e=20 scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20 being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state. Bu= t=20 changes will have to be made constructively and gradually.=20 ?       [IMAGE]=20 Chris Simms =20  Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?=20 ?? Mitch Golding=20   BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start= =20 because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the= =20 trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll= =20 see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic = in=20 his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20 miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see= =20 what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20  to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20  Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac= k=20 Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of= =20 his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. = He=20 said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to = me=20 that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, lig= ht=20 it up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watc= h=20 like everyone else. =20  I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli= na=20 with success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)= ,=20 Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t= o=20 prepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and=20 Applewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,= =20 you also had injuries dictate a few starts.=20 ?    Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the= =20 quarterbacks against Stanford?=20 ?? Nels Marshall=20   BROWN:  Here are Brown's exact words: ""Experience. We were in a tight= =20 football game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was pro= ud=20 - even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that = we=20 didn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job= =20 of coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look= =20 like it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too har= d=20 and get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday= =20 night, it is one of those things that you have to grow from."" =20 ?    Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers ha= ving=20 any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a=20 left-handed or right-handed QB?=20 ?? Dave Stastny, Austin=20   BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch= ing=20 the ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little= =20 faster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.=20 ?    Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea= r.=20 What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know= =20 that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they al= so=20 apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount = of=20 time? =20 ?? Chad Graham=20   BROWN:  No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he d= oes=20 not suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the=20 window. =20 ?       [IMAGE]=20 Jermain Anderson =20  Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b= ack=20 to linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texa= s=20 City. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the= =20 necessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be bett= er=20 suited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the=20 progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and= =20 Adam Doiron. =20  ?? Micah Hurt=20     BROWN:  Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. = They=20 are pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's=20 instincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop t= he=20 run.=20 ?    Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn= =20 football schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard= =20 Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h= as=20 remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner= =20 fans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging abo= ut=20 the Longhorns. =20 ?? Barbara and Mark Harper=20   BROWN:  As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:=20  Sept. 23 (home) vs. Houston at 6 p.m. on Fox Sept. 30 (home) vs. Oklahoma State at 11 a.m. on ABC Oct. 7 (in Dallas) vs. Oklahoma, TBA Oct. 14 at Colorado, TBA Oct. 21 (home) vs. Missouri, TBA Oct. 28 (home) vs. Baylor, TBA Nov. 4 at Texas Tech, TBA Nov. 11 at Kansas, TBA Nov. 24 (home) vs. Texas A=02?at 2:30 p.m. on ABC=20 Since you all have access to the Internet, log onto UT's sports Web site= =20 (texassports.com) and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your= =20 area. And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at=20 dallasnews.com.=20 ?    Q: This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me= the=20 number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.= =20 how's Cedric Woodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.=20   BROWN:  The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players = in=20 the NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For=20 example, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa= =20 Bay. Chris Smith was released after a free-agent tryout with Washington and= =20 Dallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota=20 Vikings. Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted. Anyway,= =20 here is the list as provided by the Big 12:  TEXAS (21) Ben Adams, OL, Miami Taje Allen, DB, St. Louis Tony Brackens, DE, Jacksonville Blake Brockermeyer, OG, Chicago Ricky Brown, RB, Cincinnati Chris Carter, DB, New England Kwame Cavil, WR, Buffalo Phil Dawson, KS, Cleveland Shane Dronett, DL, Atlanta Priest Holmes, RB, Baltimore Aaron Humphrey, DE, Tampa Bay Jay Humphrey, OL, Minnesota Derek Lewis, TE, St. Louis Wane McGarity, WR, Dallas Eric Metcalf, WR, Carolina Dan Neil, OL, Denver Roger Roesler, OL, Cincinnati Chris Smith, TE, Dallas Winfred Tubbs, LB, San Francisco Bryant Westbrook, DB, Detroit Ricky Williams, RB, New Orleans Cedric Woodard, DL, Baltimore=20 ?       [IMAGE]=20 Hodges Mitchell =20  Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y= our=20 column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and= =20 wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.= =20 However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team ""up"" sometime= s=20 and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20  About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible = for=20 the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on= e,=20 I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges= =20 Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis= =20 love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of= =20 those yards were ""move=20   the chains"" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground= and=20 protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but= =20 all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th= e=20 run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20  Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive= =20 tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t= he=20 linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there= =20 with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a= =20 receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.  Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim= e=20 against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury= =20 may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up= =20 with opponent's wideouts.  How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were= all=20 over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i= s=20 up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20 Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca= n=20 anyone at UT block?  Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim= es=20 the camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru= n=20 up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla= y=20 against?=20 ?? Andrew Bowen=20   BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20 incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday= 's=20 events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat= =20 the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any= =20 other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20 learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20  To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a= nd=20 needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20 fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl= y=20 isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di= d=20 beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop= s,=20 and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question= =20 about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe= d=20 on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t= he=20 team.=20  Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the= =20 quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still= =20 working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'= s=20 no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are= =20 the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the= =20 line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20 Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.= =20  Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it = was=20 taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about= =20 that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20 deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20 blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20 Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20  Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in= =20 games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.= =20 The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl= =20 Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl= e=20 who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B= ut=20 that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because= =20 one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed = to=20 block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play= er=20 has been chewed out every which way.  As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow= n,=20 who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa= y=20 anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still= =20 have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so= =20 early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20 constructively or destructively.=20 ?    Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding= . I=20 know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player = in=20 the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against= =20 teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M= y=20 question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker= =20 where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized= =20 and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20 recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20 ??

Darin - Great talking with you. Mail the check to 11621 Rydalwater Lane, Austin, TX 78754-5720. You wanted two season tix at $195 each and 4 OU tix at $55 each for a total of $610.  I take it you didn't want any other individual game tickets.  (I forgot to ask). We'll find out about the OU tix in late August/early September.  If we don't get them, we'll get a refund. d ---------------------------------------------------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

Steve, Congratulations.  Welcome back.  I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the deals we have booked in our system.  I was trying to reconcile them to your list of deals.  I could not.  But I think the best thing to do is to simply start over and book the deals you tell me to.  I just need the exact terms. I know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped, but when you get a chance, please give me a call.  Richard wants me to have these deals valued by the end of this month's P&L.  Thanks. DG 
Scott, Richard Tomaski wants one more physical book set up under the Enovate name while retaining the other books already set up.  This counterparty name Enovate is replacing the Midwest Energy Hub.  But wants to be able to differentiate deals done as solely Enovate with deals done as Enron Midwest. Call me if you have any further questions, or if this presents a problem. Thanks. 
The deal number in Sitara was changed because of an internal book name change.  It had nothing to do with the monetization status of the deal.  If this has caused a problem, let me know.  I didn't think that just changing the deal number would have this effect.   Thanks. DG    3-9573 Enron Global Finance 
Regina, I need two Sitara books set up in a new region.  The region can be called Enovate with the books IM Enovate and FT Enovate.  They are part of the other Chicago books:  Midwest, Midwest Program 1, and Midwest Program 2.  I have attached the book request I sent Susan Trevino.  Let me know if there is anything else I need to do.  I want to make sure that the books are not only in Sitara, but also in CPR for valuation purposes.  Thanks so much for your help. DG    3-9573 
Thanks for the great info Darron.  I am already aware of this bill and have already written both TX Senators. Better get your hammer and sickle ready comrade. Enron North America Corp. 
I got this from some hunter friends.  Thought you would like to read it. DG    3-9573 
Sorry for the wide distribution.  However, I thought all my hunting buddies should be aware of what's going on.  Who knows we may be asked to register sling shots in the future. Thanks

Susan, Attached is the completed book request form.  I just want to clarify a few things.  The first three books are for Tagg.  The last two are for Sitara.  I will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.  Do you do this?  Or can you point me in the right direction.  I really need this completed by the end of the week.  Let me know if there is something else I need to do.  Thanks for your help. DG    3-9573 
Jay, There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.  I wanted you to buy more of the existing mutual funds.  Also, I am going to write a check out of my CMA account for more than the current cash balance.  Do I need to sell some mutual fund shares? Or is it automatic?  Let me know.  Nice game in Palo Alto.  Once again the Horns can't live up to the hype. 
No interns.  As long as my group stays intact I won't need anyone in August. I think Anne will stay past her 1 year and everyone else is relatively new. I do like having analysts though and think we would rather be long than short. DG DG Jeffrey C Gossett 04/12/2001 01:32 PM 
Let me know your needs in this area so I can return this ASAP.  I will assume none of you want a Summer intern,  unless I hear otherwise.  I am mainly interested in what you think each of your groups will need in August. Thanks 
Gary, I need some Tagg books set up for the Chicago office.  I submitted a request this morning to create a new counterparty:  Enovate, LLC which will be an Enron entity.  Under Enovate LLC I need two books:  FT-ENOVATE and INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  I also need a book which will fall under the current Enron MW, LLC counterparty:  FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  And as usual I need these as soon as possible.  I will be out of the office on Friday but will return on Monday.  I really need to get deals moved to these books by the end of next week.  Please let me know if there is anything I need to do to help.  Thanks as always. 
Mark, I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have booked for the HUB deals.  He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.  Richard suggested I contact you since Steve is out.  Attached is a list of deals we currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.  They need to be verified before I can calc them for value and positions.  I will be out tomorrow, returning on Monday.  Thanks for your help.  Please call me with any questions. DG 713-853-9573 
Please look over this and get back with me on any changes you would like to make. I am going to set up a new counterparty in our system:  Enovate LLC.  Under this new counterparty will be 3 books in Tagg:  FT-ENOVATE, INTRA-ENOVATE, AND FT-INT-ENOVATE.  The INTRA-ENOVATE book will hold deals such as the Trunkline deal and will retain Rho & Drift.  The FT-ENOVATE book will be a flat book only used for  the confirmation process (deals must be in an FT book to be confirmed).  The FT-INT-ENOVATE book will pass Rho & Drift to the interest rate group.  This book will be used for EMW related deals not specific to Enovate. The current entity Enron MW LLC will continue to be used and will have the following books in Tagg:  FT & Intra NSS1, FT & Intra NSS2, and FT & Intra TP.  FT and Intra MEH books will no longer be used. The P&L will sum the 3 Enovate books to arrive at one number.  The other columns on the P&L(NSS1, NSS2, and TP) will be unaffected. I had planned on just adding the Enovate books, but think we really need to set up a new entity as well.  I have run this by accounting and have their approval.  Let me know what you think and we will start the process.  We will have this completed by the end of this month. Thanks. DG 
Steve, Attached is a list of the Hub Deals we have currently in the system.  I tried to reconcile them to the sheet you sent me but could not.  Please take a look at these and give me a call.  Thanks. DG 713-853-9573 Steve Richman@ENRON 09/06/2000 03:45 PM 
Darin, this is a summary of the Park and Loan deals that you should have. I will need to talk to you regarding the Exchange deals that are included on the summary of expected revenues. The only exchange that should be recorded under enovate should be the enron exchange for $5,000. In that exchange PGL Hub received molecules in June and returned them in July, ratable. Other than that, if you have any questions call me at 312-541-1233. Thanks-Steve Richman 
Done DG Kevin W Drachenberg 09/11/2000 10:24 AM 
Barbara Dillard's worksheet shows the full 10,000 MMBtu for 8/1/00 - 8/2/00 as SIQ (see below) which is priced at NGPL.ILL-CITYGATE.NGI.M.I - .02 USD, not tier priced as shown below in Sitara.  Unless there's some reason I'm not aware of, can you please change the full volume to be priced at NGPL.ILL-CITYGATE.NGI.M.I - .02 USD. Thanks, Kevin From Barbara's spreadsheet.............

You going to the game?  Let me know. 
I am in the process of getting these deals valued.  I know what we have booked in Tagg as of now, but need to reconcile it to what People's has booked.  I got something from Steve last time I was up, but it does not have deal terms.  Could you ask Steve for a list that has the terms of each deal? I don't even know his last name.  Thanks. 
Will you please send Richard Tomaski a version of yesterday's DPR that can be printed or forwarded.  Thanks. 
Find anything good?  I love you.

Susan, Do you have a ticket for the above referenced deal?  I am trying to find Sitara numbers, but I don't have a ticket for the deal.  Let me know.  Thanks. 
You should see this from Luchas tonight. DG Enron North America Corp. 
I totally forgot about the weekly meeting.  Sorry.  Like I said yesterday, I'm working on getting new books set up for Chicago.  I just need to follow-up with Mary Lynn on Friday before I submit requests.  I'm also working on OA issues for July.  I will teach a class on Thursday and next Tuesday to settlements about OA (just basics like desk price, customer price, and liquidations).  In addition, I need to ask you a few questions about the Trunkline deal.  When I meet with Mary Lynn on Friday, I am going to explain the deal to her.  That's about it.  Once again, I apologize about missing the meeting today. 
Kristi wanted me to send you a note saying we will be there for the game on Saturday.  See you there.

Darron, I believe you were ask about this last month.  it is still causing a pricing difference this month too.  Please call me so we can staighten out the deal or you can call Laura Scott in Canada and argue your point.  This is on open OA difference and will continue to be until you handle it. Elizabeth L Hernandez 07/21/2000 04:34 PM 
I was able to change the first deal in Sitara, but the other pricing request I did not feel comfortable making any changes.  Would you please look at this pricing issue for Client Services since they need to get it paid on Monday. 
Please correct the following deals: Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by $70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $. Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, I can no longer do this. Here is what happens: ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50 Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00 Total          $3,447,067.50 Enron Canada Books: Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00 Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00 Total          $3,447,501.00 I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday. Thanks, Jane 
After looking over the deal, I need to ask Steve Jackson a couple of questions.  So I probably will not be able to walk you through the deal today because I have some questions myself on a couple of the legs.  I was hoping to get this done today.  But for sure by the end of the week.  I want to ask you some questions about how Richard wants the books to be changed.  See you at 1:00.

Hey bunko gang...Unfortunately, Gary and I will be out of town that weekend. We are going on Gary's company's trip so we need to reschedule.  What do you guys think about September 30th?  Let me know who all can make it or suggest other dates that are more agreeable to your schedule! Thanks, Dawn 
Hey - we have not done this in a long, long time.  Dawn and Gary want to host a party at their house on Sept. 16th. Who is interested?  let us know asap so that we can find subs if needed! thanks Sheri 
It's no big deal, but I still can't see Kristi's IRA online.  I also don't receive statements in the mail for the account.  It looks as if the automated transactions worked this month.

He started to cry last night when you said you were not going to sign him up.  I think we can.  Starting Sep 1, I will not be running a book.

Lee, after I put in the deals, the system went down and I was not able to get them to calc.  So they are not in these numbers.  They will be tonight.  See you guys later today. DG

MEMO FROM GOD: 
I believe we are in agreement on the new deal amounts.  I held back $1,087,409 from the MEH book.  The MEH book lost $ mostly because there was $20K added to the P&L last Friday.  I did not add that amount back in tonight.  I don't know what it is.  I'll talk to you in the morning.  Let me know if there is something you want me to send you.  Thanks. DG

I didn't get a good response from the one person I know in IT.  So I am sending your resume out for some IT jobs I see posted on our intranet and have asked for help from the HR dept.  I didn't think this would take so long.  I appologize, but I am still trying. DG Stewart McAdoo <smcadoo@ev1.net> on 08/10/2000 08:02:37 PM 
Just a quick follow up.  Any word? What would you say the prospects are for visiting with someone about employment? Our plans are set for Sept.  We have airline and hotel reservations.

I have a friend who is looking to change employers.  He is in the IT field. I was looking on the intranet and found this posting.  Although, he would be interested in any similar job.  I will attach his resume.  What is the best way to get his resume in front of the proper people?  I would appreciate your opinion.  I don't work in the IT field and really don't know anyone at Enron that does.  Thanks in advance for your help. DG 3-9573 
More Deals. 
Kevin, I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal. Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for every EOL deal Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, just let me know and I'll follow up. Thanks. 
Gary, We need to have two more books created as soon as possible.  These need to be set up the same as the others(not as PA books) Kam requested (moving from and Intra book to an FT book). FT-INT-CNT-TRANS FT-INT-EMWMEH Call if you have any questions.  Thanks DG 
I told Dawn already, but my brother is getting married on the 16th.  We can't make it. DG 
Kim, How are you?  I got your address from Sean and wanted to make sure it worked.  I just sent a note to your dad asking if he was going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on taking the whole group up for the KU-UT game.  I hope you will be in town as well.  Let me know.  Take care. 
Uncle Clark, How are things?  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to see if you were going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.  I can't believe it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.  We are doing well here in Houston.  Everyone is getting ready for the school year.  In fact, Kristi has already started back.  The kids begin on the 9th.  Enron still seems to monopolize my time.  But it's a great place to work.  Let me know about that weekend.  I hope you will be in town as  I am looking forward to seeing you all.

Have you had a chance to look at this adjustment to $.1134?  Sitara still shows .0556. I'd like to include this adjustment on the 7/00 invoice I'm sending out tomorrow. Please let me know when updated. Thanks, Kevin x3-0560 
After reviewing the pipeline calculations, the pipeline commodity reimbursement should be the following: Commodity $.0594 Fuel  $.054 (Assuming GD Tenn/500 = $2.775 (Mar 15), and Tennessee Fuel % = 1.91%) Total  $.1134 The commodity was adjusted to recover the Tennessee pipeline commodity costs not Midwestern pipeline commodity ($.0594 vs. $.0016).  Let Kevin or myself know if you have any questions.   Please let us know when this has been completed.  Thanks. ajc 
Darron, Please update Sitara #127427 for the fuel for 3/15/2000: Commodity $.0016 Fuel  $.054 (Assuming GD Tenn/500 = $2.775 (Mar 15), and Tennessee Fuel % = 1.91%) Total  $.0556 Please let me know when this has been completed so I can redraft. Thanks a bunch, ajc 
We are definately going skiing this winter.  We have not been for over two years.  I also want the kids to start skiing.  Send all of your sisters if you have them.

The new exchange deals for the EMW Park & Loan are 350499 and 350511. DG  3-9573 KARIE HASTINGS 07/31/2000 02:28 PM 
Can you let me know when you finish correcting this EOL deal and the correct Sitara numbers? Thanks, Karie (36759) 
Elizabeth: Darin Giron called me about the EOL park and loan deal from Friday. These deals will cause differences with your EOL-Sitara reconciliation. The EOL deal will error out in Spreadsheet - Natural Gas, therefore you won't see it erroring out under Sitara. The EOL Park and Loan deal should be booked as four deals in Sitara. These Park and Loan deals should be booked as two exchange deals (one receipt and one delivery) between ENA and the third party. And then two desk to desk deals between ENA and EMW. The EOL deal number should be referenced on both of the exchange deals. Darin booked EOL deal 330098 as two physical forwards (348347 and 348364) and two desk to desks (348362 and 348375). He is going to create the two exchange deals and kill the two physical forwards and reference the EOL deals numbers on the exchange deals. Let me know if you have any questions. Karie (36759)

Regarding the attached. . . Paul- I made edits to the document, but I have asked Jeff Sorenson to review the Confirmations piece, and I asked Darron Giron to review the Settlements piece.

Jay, I looked over the info you forwarded but have decided to just buy two mutual funds.  Unless you have a better suggestion, buy APGCX and MCGTX.  And I really mean it when I say if you have a better suggestion let me know.  It looks like the transfers worked properly.  But are the automatic purchases of mutual funds in place?  I don't see the activity on the web page.  Lastly, and I think this is just administrative stuff, Kristi's Roth IRA does not show up on the web or on the statements we receive in the mail.  Thanks.

Audrey, I'm in Chicago now but I need to ask you some questions about a few Sitara deals.  They are 298277, 298283, and 298296.  They are between EPMI and EMW. Are these deasl going to be settled by Unify?  Do we currently see Unify invoices/verifications for EMW or EPMI?  Thanks. 
It looks better. DG 
Any word on a stock for Carley's custodial account?  Also, I would like to talk about selling the Dell in my IRA and diversify some.  Let me know what you think.  I'm in Chicago and am returning on Friday afternoon.  I can check my email.  Thanks.

Stephanie, We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith. Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this request.  Thanks for your help. 
Done. DG Audrey Cook 06/15/2000 07:15 PM

Darron, you recognized 3.975 (thousand) of orig, and I did not see that coming out of any book. Could you let me know who granted that. I know  0.5  (thousand) were granted by the NG Price, but I could not fine anything else. Also, if you could please look into the 468 (dollars) that I mentioned on my previous email, I would appreciate it. Thanks. If you have any questions let me know. Gabriel 
Gabriel, We recognized a total of $9,488 of Orig last night.  All from FT-Central.  Is the $468 from another book? DG    3-9573 Gabriel Monroy 06/15/2000 08:10 PM

You can get good speaker packages, but many of them are not really good. I'll bring some magazines that have articles on some good speaker sets.  You can also just put your own package together.  If you do this make sure the speakers are of the same brand.  This is what I did for Scott.  Many of the speaker packages use  5 small speakers and a sub.  But I suggested larger front L&R speakers to Scott for playing music.  Any decent receiver will have a decoder built in.  And I do have some brand names, but it really depends on how much you are willing to spend.  I'll go through my stash of magazines tonight and see what I can find for you to read. DG Mike Fultz <Mike.Fultz@HALLIBURTON.com> on 04/05/2001 04:30:53 PM 
Scott, Did you buy your surround sound speakers as a package (left/right/center/surround left/surround right/subwoofer) or did you buy all the speakers separately.  I would like to buy them all as a package or maybe all but the subwoofer and buy that separately.  What did you do??  I have seen some pretty cool JBL Speaker Packages. Also, what reciever did you get? Even though your DVD player has a decoder built in, I am assuming that your reciever has a decoder built in also.

I asked Keith Holst (trader) again.  His answer was the same.  There were more buyers than sellers in the West during March, hence the price was stronger.  Thanks. DG 
Darron -- Thanks for your response.  We understand that the west traded higher in general during March v. Feb,  as evidenced by the data.  However, we are looking for specific reasons as to why this is so.  For example, if the market was more volatile at these locations, then why?  What particular market conditions sparked large price changes, etc?  Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Jennifer 
Jennifer, The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further questions. DG 
Sorry.  I just did.

Done DG 
Jeff, I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is easier said than done. 
Greg, Transport Deals/Transport Model OA Relationships between systems (Tagg, Sitara, Portcalc, MetaCalc, Curveview, Excel, Access, Pub Posting, TDS) These are mostly basic. DG Greg Couch 04/17/2001 01:16 PM 
Just a reminder to each of you that I requested this info by tomorrow.  I've received only one response so far. Let me know if you have questions. Greg 
I have decided to revive the risk brown bag training sessions. I need, from each of you, a list of the topics you would like to see covered.  I would like to see topics ranging from the most basic, up - whatever you feel is necessary for your group.  Please provide these to me no later than 04/18.  Feel free to offer anything.  Think about the concepts in the training modules while you are compiling your lists. Once I have the topics, I will work with you to arrange a logical order to cover them in.  After that  Irena and I will set up a calendar, with approximately one session per month.  I am targeting mid-May for the first session. The format of each session is up to the presenter, but a couple of suggestions are: a short presentation followed by Q&A, or an open forum. Each session will be led by one of you, a suitable substitute, Jeff, or I, depending on the topic.  I will schedule, with your input and cooperation, who will present each topic. I am also sending this note to John and Russ. John, I ask that you think about OA concepts that you feel will benefit the risk group, help our personnel work better with your group, and help us understand your duties better.  I would like for you to present at least a couple of topics to us. Russ, if you think there are Sitara issues that would benefit the group, please let me know. I am open to whether these sessions are mandatory or not.  My feeling is that some should be and others (the ones of a more basic nature) should only be mandatory for those people you feel need that month's subject matter.  Let me know your opinion on this. With a small investment of your time, I believe this will be an excellent vehicle to get (and keep) topics of interest and training in front of your people. I look forward to receiving your lists.  Let me know if you have any questions. Greg

No, I sent the email to you by mistake.  We will be at Sheri's tomorrow.  How do you know her?  Is it through Dawn?  When Sheri sent the message to everyone, I noticed your name on the list and called to ask, but you didn't pick up, and I didn't leave a message. 
I won't blame you if you don't get that requested info to me.  I migrated to Windows 2000 and it had an old address book.  Sorry.

Is it really necessary to change the book names just to avoid confusion?  Who is confused?  Can't we just inform those who need to know that the Denver books are simply another desk that rolls up into the West Region?  I don't want to be difficult, but it will require a great deal of time and effort to change every deal in the Denver books to a new name.  Let me know what you think. DG    3-9573 
Here it is.  Let me know if you have any questions. DG 
Please get this info to Jim.  Thanks. DG

Hi guys, I've just come across a few deals that are in TAGG as settling between ENA and Aquila Canada Corp.  These deals would not have shown up when you looked for deals to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as they aren't in TAGG as ECC deals.  I have a feeling that there are lots of deals like this in TAGG, but I just don't know where. We are having problems printing TAGG tickets up here, so I'm not able to see which books these deals are in right now. What I'm requesting is that you go through all your books and look for all deals with Aquila Canada Corp. that are to settle for March and April 2001, and after, and flip these deals into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  As it stands, I'm missing at least 10 deals from the April 2001 Nymex invoice, and I want to make sure that these deals don't get invoiced by someone in Houston settlements. Nymex settled yesterday for April, so invoicing for these deals is taking place today. I understand that you are all very busy right now, but it would really be appreciated if this was dealt with as soon as possible today.  The settlements group and I need to get our invoices sent out today, so we need these deals to be fixed right away. Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter, and let me know if I can assist you in any way. Thanks so much for your help Stacey- 
We added $75M so Schedule C tonight. DG

Hi guys, Here is a list of the deals that I've come across in the different books that still need to be flipped to the P& book by the end of today. FT-CENT QU4059.1 FT-NORTHWEST FT-ONTARIO FT-WEST GD-CENTRAL NG-EXOTIC QY3631.1 NG-PRICE These were the only books that I found deals to be flipped.  I was looking for all deals that are to settle during March and April 2001 with ECC.  If you find any others that I might have missed, please flip them. Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Thanks for all your help Stacey

Hi Jeff, Could you please do me a favor, and make sure that all Canadian deals that are in Houston books are flipped to the P& book.  I don't have a current list of all the desk leads, so I thought that I'd ask you to forward this message on to them for me.  I know that the EOL group is still working on a solution to our problem, but there are still deals that are in Houston books that need to be flipped. Please let me know if there is anything I can help with.  Thanks for your help on this. Stacey

Jennifer, NGI-PGE/TOPOCK is an internal curve used to value transport and is equal to NGI-SOCAL.  This curve will probably show up every month because the West Coast is very volitile.  The change is due to a change in the market. IF-TW/PERMIAN is a production area curve.  The change is also due to  market changes that drove up the curve. Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Hi guys, I've come across this deal that needs to be flipped right away. This deal is in the MGMT-WEST book with Aquila Canada Corp. and ENA.  It needs to be in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book settling between ECC and Aquila Canada Corp.  This is causing problems with the February Liquidations as I settled this deal with Aquila, but it isn't coming through the liquidations correctly.  Please let me know when this is done so I can let Shannon McPearson know that she needs to re-run the February Liquidations. Thanks Stacey 
Jennifer, Phillip Allen and Keith Holst indicated that the curve changes in question for Socal was simply due to a higher forward market.  Let me know if you have any further questions. DG 
Please get responses for these back to Jennifer today. Thanks 
Darron, Could you make sure that these seven deals are changed in Tagg to ENA I would really appreciate it.  Thanks for all of your help with these specific deals.  Also, if you could let me know when they are corrected, I will let Bob Bowen know.  Thanks TARA Please change to ENA instead of Riskmantra: QL0460 QM6735 QM3739 QN0626 QN7938 QN7939 QO1412

Sean, I found out that Silver Creek is a very small resort close to the town of Granby, CO.  It is acutally 15 miles north of Winter Park and 2 miles south of Granby along Hwy 40.  We are staying at a condo there from Sunday night (11th) thru Thursday night (15th).  I indicated we would like to go to Winter Park because we have been there and it is close.  We want to ski 2 days in Silver Creek and 2 days somewhere else.  If you can make it during the week to Keystone, then yes we will go there instead of WP.  I would love to go to an Avs game, but we will probably need to be on the road by late afternoon on Sunday. Once again, we get in on Saturday (10th) about 9pm.  That's pretty late so we may or may not be able to do anything that night.  We will leave on Sunday (11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th). Then our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.  If you can get away during the week to ski, that would be awesome.  Thanks for all your hospitality.  See you soon. DG ""Sean Mayers"" <smmayers@earthlink.net> on 02/24/2001 10:17:54 AM 
Darron, The weather is great here.  In March, we receive every type of weather.  One day we could get 12 inches of snow, the next day it could be 80!  I have a pass to Keystone, Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, and A-Basin.  My pass does not include Winter Park (although I have a free lift ticket that I could use and go skiing with you.).  My pass cost $300 and I get unlimited use (I have been 23 times this year-I think I got my money worth!).  I do not know where Silvercreek is, but I will look. Do you mean Silverthorne by chance?  If there is any way to go to Keystone, it would save Tracie and I some money.  But, I understand that it is your vacation and if you go to Winter Park, let me know and price is no concern.  This is how I rank the resorts as far as skiing: 1. Vail  2. Copper  3. Keystone  4. Winter Park/Mary Jane  5. Breckenridge. I have not been to Beaver Creek, but I heard that it was awesome.  Even though I ranked WP fourth, it is still a great resort.  The runs at Keystone and Vail are long and Vail is the largest resort in USA (5300 acres compared to 2000 for Keystone!).  As far as atmosphere (night life), Vail is by far the best.  Winter Park does not have much at the ski resort as far as night life (that I recall, but I have not been there much.).  You have to go into town, which is small.  Breckenridge is good for the night as well and so is Copper, but Vail is the best (I love Vail if you have not noticed!).  Just let me know as far as plans.  We have a busy March.  On March 17, the day you leave, we have a wedding.  On Friday night, we might have to go to the rehearsal dinner, but I do not know yet.  Michelle and the kids are coming up in March also.  Maybe she can come up at the same time.  We always have a room available. I am looking forward to seeing you and Kristi.  Let me know if you guys want to do anything in Denver.  You can also go snowmobiling and snowshoeing as well. If you guys need any ski gear or accessories, let me know and I will check here for prices.  Plus, you can borrow some of my gear on the days I can't meet up with you. You guys are going to love it here.  You also need to come out in the summertime.  It is so much better.  I think my sisters and dad are coming out again for the 4th of July.  We went white water rafting last year and Kim loved it. Looking forward to seeing you. Sean

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away. Please let me know if you have any questions on this. Thanks Stacey

This is just a quick reminder for all of you to please go into all of your books and flip out all the deals that are supposed to settle with ECC and a third counterparty  to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of the day today. Nymex closes today, and we need to make sure that all the deals are booked correctly for both the Calgary and Houston offices.  This is most important for February and March 2001 deals. Please let me know if you have any questions on this. Thanks for all your help Stacey 
Chris, We are taking $100M to Schedule C tonight.  I don't know when it may be released. DG 
This deal is related to the long term transportation that was sold to Calpine, but it is correctly booked as a physical forward sale at Malin. DG Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 02/23/2001 04:33 PM 
Darron, This is the deal I phoned you about yesterday which Eric Moon put together -  should it be booked as Transportation deal instead of a Forward ? Ellen 
No I don't.  This deal is a Physical Forward.  Usually when it pertains to a transportation the trader usually creates a Transportation Capacity ticket in Sitara.  When it hits our portfolio we would then set it up in Global Contracts. Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sylvia x3-5755 Ellen Wallumrod@ENRON 02/22/2001 05:21 PM 
Sylvia, I'm looking into this deal and after researching it  it seems like there should be a separate Transportation Contract for this deal, and should not be confirmed by us on the Confirmation desk. Do you know anything about this deal or Contract ? Eric Moon in Gas Structuring is the dealmaker and he asked me to talk to Darron Giron who is a book admin. This deal relates to Tagg # EC3952  -  apparently they pulled loads of different transportation deals from our books and sold it on to Calpine. It seems to me there must be a Contract out there for this 8 year deal. Ellen x54099 
Hey folks. Just a note, Calpine Energy Services, LP deal #559974 was originally attached to a GTC due to the fact that the contracts group had not yet received the master contract. The contract was received & entered into Global this week & as a result we moved the above referenced deal to the master (Global #96056886). Transaction term information: 5/1/01 - 10/31/08. Please reconfirm as necessary. Thanks all! 
Chris, We are taking $100M to Schedule C tonight.  I don't know when it may be released. DG 
Please make sure this guy gets what he needs.  Thanks. DG 
As part of our monthly testing, we review the monthly Natural Gas P & L Statement and identify specific regions for which we would like to review additional documentation.  Please find below, the regions that we have identified.  We are requesting that you supply the P & L top pages for the last day of the month for those regions that are applicable to you.  Once we have reviewed these top pages, we will be contacting you to discuss the drivers of these regions.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  As of February 28th, Arthur Andersen employees will no longer have access to Enron Lotus Notes.  I am asking that all correspondence please be sent to my Arthur Andersen Lotus Notes account at mark.c.austin@us.arthurandersen.com. Thank You, Mark Austin Arthur Andersen ext. 68680 
I will attend 
If you have any questions about this let me know.  It will be a pain in the ass if the deal is between Enovate and Oneok but is then flipped to EMW to manage.  There will be twice as many legs and the volumes will need to be adusted at minimum on a monthly basis, and likely a weekly basis.  Again, let me know if you need anything. DG 
We arrive in Denver on Saturday evening (the 10th).  We will stay that night and leave sometime on Sunday for Silvercreek.  We will return to Denver on Friday the 16th and stay the night.  Our plane back to Houston is early Saturday morning.  We are staying at a place in Silvercreek (I had not heard of this place before Kristi's friends made the plans) for 5 nights.  I think we want to ski there and possibly in Winter Park (it is supposed to be within 15 miles).  How's the weather in Denver these days?  We look forward to seeing the two of you.  Thanks. DG ""Sean Mayers"" <smmayers@earthlink.net> on 02/17/2001 10:21:28 AM

Any feedback?? 
This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this application more efficient.  Such as: 1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 message/second. 2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a transaction without having the screen update with new deals. 3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates very quickly. 4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, etc. and it  will filter to that section. Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated! Thanks, Dawn

I am working on OA for phase II Dec prod.  It looks like there are liquidations on the buy side that equal the variance on the sales side for the above ref counterparty.  Look at NW9561.2 and NX4842.2.  Is it okay to assume that these liquidations belong on the  purchase side.  This is for the west region. Call if you have questions. Thanks! 
Let me know if either of you have questions. Greg 
How goes it?  I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for March.  I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the four of us.  He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying with us.  I hope this is OK.  He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out one night.  Let me know.  Also,  I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad school.  He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.  Talk to you soon.

I just looked at their sight.  They seem like a reputable company.  It's a store in Manhattan, NY.  The only thing to be concerned about when ordering by phone or online is when there is a problem with the unit.  It is more of a pain in the ass to mail it back than to just take it to Circuit City or Best Buy.  But a Sony DVD is very reliable and you should not have a problem.  I'd pull the trigger, that's a great price. DG Mike Fultz <Mike.Fultz@HALLIBURTON.com> on 02/12/2001 03:09:08 PM 
Darron, I am ready to purchase the Sony C670D DVD Player.  I have gone thru CNET.com and found a three star (highest rating) certified CNET dealer that sells it for $340  - Tweeter has it for $449 + tax and Circuit City and Best Buy don't carry this model.  The name of the Internet company is moreaudiovideo.com. Did you order yours off the internet and if so from whom?  I am a little weary about buying something like this off the internet...
